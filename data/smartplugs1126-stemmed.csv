solid hardwar hamper by inconsist homkit notif,2.0,the hardwar for the ihom smartmonitor is solid the issu i encount use thi devic wa mainli with their app and homekit after plug in thi devic and instal the ihom io app the first thing that need to be don is to updat the firmwar it doe not appear that ihom give ani notif when the firmwar need to be updat further when new firmwar is be instal there is no progress bar that show how far well the instal is go you ll just receiv a notif when the firmwar ha finish instal as of thi write i m use io 10 3 1 by default homekit notif are turn off for the ihom smartmonito to enabl notif you need to long press or 3d press on the devic icon for thi devic in the appl home app then click on the detail button at the end of the page that come up then scroll down to until you see statu and notif click the statu and notif button to enabl notif for thi devic one you do that you will begin to receiv notif for the part of the devic that is the motion detector for homekit temperatur humid motion and light level can be use as input for the rule engin from my test the motion detector wa the most reliabl i wa abl to setup a rule to turn on and off my light via the elgato rule interfac and the appl home rule interfac without ani issu howev i did notic that the motion detector is veri sensit i have the elgato motion detector elgato eve motion wireless motion sensor with appl homekit technolog bluetooth low energi which allow you to set the sensit of their devic but there is no sensit set for the motion detector part of the ihom smartmonitor therefor sometim i get spuriou motion alert in a room where there is no one in it but the sun will cast a shadow and the motion detector will pick up that shadow as a person with the elgato motion detector in the same area i don t get these fals alert while the humid detector seem to be report the correct valu the homekit rule engin seem to have problem turn on and off devic use the humid as an input for a test i turn on the hot water in my shower to steam up the bathroom idevic ha a new product out on their websit which is a wi fi base homekit light switch i connect that switch to my bathroom fan and setup a rule such that when the humid got to a certain level the fan will turn on and when goe back to a lower level the fan turn off thi test wa pretti much hit and miss sometim it work and sometim it didn t work i tri set differ rule in both the elgato rule interfac and the appl home app rule engin in both case the rule were not alway execut so i m assum thi is a homekit issu and not an ihom issu i also tri trigger a hue light just to make sure there wa not someth wrong with the idevic light switch but again the hue light would sometim come on and sometim it wouldn t use motion to setup a rule alway work so i m not sure whi humid would give an issu unfortun i did not get a chanc to test temperatur and light lux as input to the homekit rule engin so i don t know how well those perform the ihom amazon echo skill doe not recogn thi devic so you can t ask alexa for the temperatur and humid set in the room the smart monitor is in but on the whole i think thi devic is solid the homekit integr with some of the sensor is a bit hit or miss but i m not sure ihom can do anyth about that in the futur i hope ihom would implement email notif for the temperatur and humid sensor like honeywel lyric doe lyric wi fi water leak freez detector io notif are fine but when you travel oversea sometim the notif are not as reliabl while email alway work updat 06 15 2017 thi ha turn out to be a realli good sensor sinc io 10 3 2 wa releas the issu list abov with homekit ha been resolv everyth work now further i can set a rule to turn on my light when the light sensor regist a particular lux valu and turn them off when the light sensor hit a higher lux valu i have success creat homekit rule for humid temperatur motion and light level the onli thing miss is creat a homekit rule for sound as a trigger or as a condit valu homekit doesn t recogn sound as an input to the rule engin as yet updat 08 08 2017 there is bug in the ihom firmwar for thi devic that make the motion sensor not work correctli with homekit first the firmwar ignor the occup timeout that is in the app therefor onc motion is sens the clear signal may be sent an hour after the motion signal or not at all next there is no way to set the sensit of the motion sensori like you can do for the elgato motion sensor or the philip hue motion sensor the next problem ha to do with the light sensor ihom use a custom characterist for thi devic which at thi time few homekit app support therefor it s veri difficult to edit the light lux valu in a trigger and set it to a particular valu the upper rang of the light lux valu is veri larg therefor use the slider in ani homekit app if you tri to set the lux valu to a particular number let s say 5 ani movement in the slider will result in a veri larg number lastli it take thi devic too long to notic a chang in the light level it can take up to 2 minut for a chang in light level to be notic sinc thi devic is power by ac i would expect a chang in light level to be recogn almost immedi therefor becaus of these issu i have to lower my rate for thi devic and i do no recommend peopl buy it until these issu are fix there is no way to properli use all the sensor in homekit trigger for homekit thi devic is veri broken,"iHome ISP6X Wi-FI Smart Plug - use your voice to control connected devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and

comparison of ihom and idevic switch,4.0,now that i have spent some time with some of the smart plug devic in my hous i thought i would share some feedback my origin intent wa to load up on smart plug which work with the appl homekit setup sinc it wa an easi fit for my iphon i know from research that the product which are compat with the homekit are more secur in the setup which should make them more resist to the hacker attack we hear about in the news late home devic which connect with home wifi need to be secur or a hacker can take control of them and use them to bring down other comput server anyway the first smart plug i bought were from ihom both the isp5 and isp6 model i first use the ihom app for io to get them set up and the process couldn t have been easier each devic ha a uniqu identifi code and can be ad to one s home system by simpli use the phone s camera to scan the id code in the owner s manual or on the side of the devic the latter concept is clearli plan b sinc it is much easier to add a plug to the system onc it is in place in the wall socket the differ between the two model seem to be there is an option wireless remot avail for the isp6 model and the configur of the reset button and oper light is slightli differ otherwis they work the same and whichev you can find at the better price would be the better choic i have a total of four within my hous and all have been rock solid from the time they were set up and ad to my ihom app the ihom plug though have a straight through design which make the devic s plug for the lamp coffe maker etc extend that much further from the wall in mani case thi might not be an issu but in a few instal for me it did matter for that reason i tri the idevic switch which accept the devic s plug on the side instead of straight through thi mean i could hook up a tabl lamp which wa on a piec of furnitur which back up to the wall outlet i need to use the ihom smart plug didn t allow the cabinet to sit close to the wall after allow for the space requir for the ihom switch and the lamp cord plug directli into it the idevic switch wa a littl more troubl in allow itself to be recogn by the idevic io app it doe have an integr led bar on the front of the devic which is adjust in the idevic app for both color and bright there are some valid applic possibl to use the plug as a nightlight in a room provid just the right amount of color and intens for the specif applic you requir unfortun the idevic smart plug play hard to get and disappear from it own io app when i fold both system into the home app on the iphon the idevic plug often becom invis to the home app just as it doe to it own app the onli remedi i have found is wait as it sometim becom link again with the app in a matter of a minut or less or close an reopen the home app i know thi is not a uniqu problem to the idevic smart plug i bought becaus i later bought the idevic socket which fit between your light bulb and the lamp socket it would screw into which allow the idevic socket to adjust the bright of your bulb assum it is dimmabl to begin with and the color and intens of a ring of led around the base where the light bulb screw in thi open the possibl of easi adjust abl mood light from the color led which can work independ of the light bulb one ha alreadi screw in the problem with the execut of thi concept are two fold the size of the devic when place between the bulb and lamp socket make the total height of the bulb such that the lampshad most like will no longer fit and the socket play hard to get with the idevic app and io home app in the same way the idevic smart plug doe thi would appear to be an engin problem for idevic though possibl one which might be fix with a firmwar updat in the futur so i wa the badass of the hous set up the time schedul of the lamp and turn them on through siri voic control or simpli tap the button on the home app but my wife wa frustrat becaus she couldn t access the lamp on demand as i could enter alexa i bought a dot at best buy they had a ton while amazon is on back order and brought it home now my wife can voic command the ihom lamp on and off along with amazon music she s have more fun than i expect just as with the home app the ihom smart plug work flawlessli but the idevic plug and lamp socket don t work at all alexa apolog and say she can t see them even though i have ad the skill to alexa s setup sinc the lamp i have use the idevic plug and lamp socket are not mission critic to the home s roster of lamp and doe work most of the time with my iphon s home app i am not worri about thi for now again it is my hope that idevic get a firmwar updat to address the wonki of their devic connect if you read the review both of the idevic product on amazon and the alexa board with peopl unabl to get alexa to see their idevic plug either it indic my situat is neither uniqu nor isol if you re intend to go thi rout consid thi a veri strong recommend for the ihom smart plug and a guard recommend for the idevic product which have veri strong featur set but fail at their basic mission too easili and a big shout out to alexa surprisingli good execut for 40,"iHome ISP6X

overal great buy work as advertis without ani seriou complaint,4.0,usual i don t purchas item from amazon that have a rate of less than 4 star but i decid to give thi product a chanc as there are multipl factor that could affect each individu user s experi strength of wifi signal whether or not the product wa instal correctli etc overal i like thi product after buy the first switch i wait for a week to get a good feel of whether or not it would perform as advertis and without some of the neg issu that i ve seen in other review i wa satisfi so i decid to buy 4 more eas of instal there s a steep learn curv with instal thi product the first devic took around 45 minut to instal that includ research youtub video that explain how to instal a regular light switch into a 3 panel box and follow the video on the wemo websit i would compar the instal of thi product with the instal of an overhead fan or replac a thermostat by far the most time consum part is make sure that everyth fit within the box the subsequ instal took less and less time it would ve been nice if the wemo websit had multipl video for the most common instal scenario softwar setup the setup isn t complic howev it would ve been nicer if you could push one button and it take care of the entir setup within a few second instead you have to navig back and forth between the wireless network and the app my biggest complaint here wa that the softwar updat took a few minut for each light overal the setup is easi i just think that it could ve been easier aesthet the toggl and face plate are aesthet pleas troubl shoot there have been a few occas when the power to the hous ha turn off and on onc the modem and router have restart the wemo light switch haven t had ani problem reconnect to the internet and resum their schedul for the most part so far ani connect issu i ve had with the light switch were initi by the wireless network go down i ve found that the simplest fix wa just to reboot the router and the wemo doe the rest as far as connect me again app the app is intuit and easi to navig through it s ifttt compat mean you can use the ifttt app to do some cool thing ex when i press and hold ani one of my light for more than a few second i receiv a phone call on my phone use if you misplac your phone insid your hous thi doesn t justifi spend the money on one of these light but it s an ad perk if you re tri to decid between a wirelessli control light or someth like the honeywel econoswitch i would ve given thi product 5 star if it were cheaper the video show the physic instal of the product wa more help and if the updat didn t take so long,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

instal is pain especi if you have mac address filter on,4.0,instal is pain especi if you have mac address filter on howev onc you get past that it seem to work fine we have onli had these for a day so i cannot speak to longev of the product yet thu far work great with alexa echo dot if you are not network liter what follow will probabl be gibberish to you i m go to describ how to get these devic onto your local network wifi without have to perman disabl your mac address filter for the network newbi a mac address is a uniqu address assign to a network card devic therefor each of these mini plug ought to have their own mac address in fact they do unfortun the mfg doe not provid the mac address on the packag i have found onlin and i think on thi product list a post that say you can access the intern inform of the mini plug via the phone app there are two problem with thi 1 to use the phone app to view the intern data of the mini smart plug you have to success set up the plug use your phone unfortun for you you have to get your mini smart plug configur and on your local network befor you can see the intern data of the devic if mac address filter is enabl on your wifi network you cannot get the plug on your wifi network becaus you haven t told the wifi router that the plug s mac address should be allow becaus you don t yet know what the mac address is kind of a catch 22 2 the intern inform of the devic that you can see use the phone app is not the mac address so the onli thing you are left with is discov the mac address of each devic and to do that you must have administr access to your wireless router and know how to 1 enabl disabl the mac address filter 2 know how to get a list of devic current attach to your wifi router the gener step are as follow 1 disabl mac address filter on your router 2 while you are at it note the mac address of all devic current connect to your wifi router 3 follow the setup procedur that came with the mini smart plug to connect your phone to the mini smart plug and to get the smart plug on your home network you can now get it on the home network becaus you have turn off mac address filter 4 go back to the router screen that tell

great overcharg protect outlet,5.0,i ve had the chanc to play around with thi littl guy for a coupl of day now and i have to say i am veri impress with the way thi outlet work i use an appl phone to control the app the app wa a littl difficult to find in the appl store so i use a qr reader to read the bar code that wa in the manual and that work out fine there is two function on the plug there is an easi mode and hotspot mode person i don t like the hotspot mode it a bit spotti to me some time the wireless connect would work and sometim it won t so i person don t recommend use the hotspot mode i think the reason for thi function is to act like a wifi extend in case you have a weak signal the devic will hook up to your wireless network and act as a the network so you can connect to it instead of the wifi you are current on but when you use it as a hot spot you are unabl to use it function as a plug so it either one or the other the other function that thi use is a remot control outlet which i am impress with it the app let you control what you want to do with it either set it on countdown or have a timer function that you can leav and it will turn on for you at a certain time the timer function work great i ve left the count down for an hour and the app will show the countdown time as well to show you how much time is left until it auto shut off also the best part i think about thi is that you can turn on the countdown and then turn off your phone and it will still auto shutdown like it suppos to to me that is the best part becaus when you charg a devic and you want to maintain the qualiti of the batter you should turn off you devic and let it charg and with thi outlet you can leav it charg set up the countdown on the app and then turn it off and don t have to worri about over charg it the plug itself is usual off so if you want to turn it on manual and not open the app everi time then you can plug in your devic and press the side button to turn it on but you won t be abl to use the timer or the countdown function unless you go through the app,"Wifi Smart Plug Mini, GMYLE Smart Home Power Control Socket, Remote Control Your Household Equipment from Everywhere, No Hub Required, Works with Amazon Alexa, Echo Dot & Google Home (4 Packs)"
