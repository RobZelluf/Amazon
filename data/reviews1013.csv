smart living üëçüèªüëçüèª,5.0 ,"I‚Äôm a big fan of smart living, been using wemo smart plugs and i really love the convenience. But i been very annoy that wemo smart plug is fairly large and sometime (depends how your outlet set up) it might take up both of my outlet space so I decided to get the mini size one. while browsing for info about wemo mini, this 3 pack deal comes into my search and the price caught my eye; this dailycomb smart plugs only cost less than 1/2 of the wemo mini so i decide to give it a try since everyone tried to use this kind of smart plug will know, you will not just get one and just use the only one ;) so instead of spending over $100 for 3, so i went with it. **been using the plugs for about 3 weeks, they are steady and i found the operation of these plugs are actually MUCH easier than Wemo cause the wifi setup for wemo sometime is real pain; for this one you just need to follow the instruction (have clear english instruction, i believe is not google translate), download the app, hook up wifi and they are good to go! like it has extra usb so i can charge my devices while using it, only downside about these plugs are the plastic feels pretty thin, unlike wemo they do feel study. but this doesn‚Äôt effect the basic function of the plugs**","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Home, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, Easy Connection With TP-Link WeMo Netgear Router (3 PACK)"
Nice smart plugs,5.0 ,"I really like the idea of smart plug. I have one want. It works great but the size is too big. It took away two outlet spaces. And it's a little pricy. I looked specifically for smartplugs with rectangular shape which won't block other outlets when plugs in. This is the one I want. A pack of three really give me control on multiple devices. The app is easy to set up and control different devices well. My only complaint is the prints on the instruction manual is so tiny. Basically, the app needed is called BrightFun. I just downloaded from app store and follow the instruction in the app and it's ready to go. No need to read the tiny prints.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Home, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, Easy Connection With TP-Link WeMo Netgear Router (3 PACK)"
Quality smart plugs,5.0 ,"The 3 pack smart plugs come in a box with 3 individually packaged plugs, which you can keep all for yourself or give a few away as a present. I used a smart plug to control my WiFi bulb, and connected the plug with my echo dot through Alexa. Now the WiFi is off when the family is sleeping; I suppose it is good for your health. It‚Äôs nice that the plug has a USB charging port that can power one more equipment at the same time.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Home, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, Easy Connection With TP-Link WeMo Netgear Router (3 PACK)"

takes time but works,5.0 ,"spent a good amount on it. It turned out to be working nicely which means everything . The pic in the instruction is somewhat miss-leading. The app name is BrightFun not that Chinese characters. It did not work for me at the begining since the device is showed offline. Some lesson learnt here: although it may say not connect successfully, the devise still show up in the app. This will not working while u try to connect to the Alexa. Only when it is successfully linked to the smartlife app, Alexa will work. Otherwise, Alexa will accept yr commend but do nothing.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Home, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, Easy Connection With TP-Link WeMo Netgear Router (3 PACK)"

Reliable Product and Works Great With Alexa,5.0 ,"After becoming completely disgusted with the WEMO devices I purchased working reliability, I tried the Smart Plug to make it possible to turn my lamps on/off using my voice and my Alexa Echo Dot. They worked great and were easy to enable using the app I downloaded. They have worked reliably every since. I really didn't need the USB charge port where I have my lamps plugged in, but it may turn out to be convenient. Because they have worked so reliably, I'll probably get some light switches from this same company.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Home, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, Easy Connection With TP-Link WeMo Netgear Router (3 PACK)"

Good product,5.0 ,"Overall I'm very satisfied. It's well made and not too big. The manual is every clear, phone app is easy to use, and is well integrated with Alexa. So far I have tried using it to control my lamp on the night stand so I don't need to crawl out of bed to turn it on and off, and it works great. Note that you can still manually switch this outlet on and off, just need to press on its green/blue indicating light on the side. The other comment probably didn't know this. Also as another comment mentioned, you need to download the app named ""Smart Life - Smart Living"", from then on everything should be easy.","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/ios) (15A 2Pack)"

$30 for two is as good as a deal you can get,5.0 ,"Simple and straightforward. It just works after a few steps as instructed. $30 for two is as good as a deal you can get. Remembered I spent 39.99 for an Apple Home product before and I deeply regretted it when I saw this deal.

"Frustrating, and after a lot of headache some outlets just flake out after several hours.",1.0 ,"App did nothing. Could not come figure or connect outlets to WiFi. After 45 mins, I gave up. Reviews on Google Play Store all said the same thing as well, that it does not work. UPDATE: I realized after the fact that there are MULTIPLE apps with the same name - your instructions say to download the app called ""Smart Life"" - of which there are three - and I select the wrong one (The one you want is actually called ""Smart Life - Smart Living""). After getting the correct app, I was able to get the outlets set up, but some of them are having issues where they stop responding after several hours - including even the physical button on the device (pressing it does nothing; the device is frozen in the on or off state). The only way to get it to work again it to unplug and replug it. After several hours again, same result. I have tried resetting the devices and re configuring them - no change in result. I have checked the signal level to the devices (moderately strong, >-65dB) as well. I am out of ideas for what is wrong, so I will be returning the outlets. It kind of defeats the concept if I have to constantly go around the house to unplug things to reset the outlets so I can control them with other devices.","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/ios) (15A 2Pack)"
I love this WiFi smart socket,5.0 ,"I love this WiFi smart socket. I have used other WiFi smart sockets before but what's nice about this one is the design of it. Does not take up two sockets or makes it difficult to plug something else in while one is in use. As you can see in my pictures, both of them fit perfectly in any double wall socket. I'm impressed with the quality of these wall sockets. Does not feel cheap. Has a nice feel to it period was very very easy to hook up to the WiFi network and to get it programmed to do my smart stuff. I love the design of it. It does work with Alexa.

outstanding technology,5.0 ,"I absolutely love these! They arrived neatly packaged and early along with a beautifully printed business card. The instructions were as clear as day as to how to set the electrical sockets up. It took me about 2 minutes to set up with the app. That was mostly just registering an account and setting up to alexa. It works with your smart phone at the tap of a button, or with alexa app. We have an amazon echo in our home, it works with that as well. Make sure to name each socket differently to not confuse yourself. I added a short clip of the echo paired with the outlet in action.","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/ios) (15A 2Pack)"
"Good overall, can still be improved",4.0 ,"The packaging is very nice-looking, as well as the plug itself. The plug works as described, if installed properly. It enables me to close the light in the bedroom with just one-click on the phone. Sometimes I still forget about the app and will want to manually open / close it with its own switch but I just can't :'( Just need to get used to it if remote control is something you want. That being said, the pairing stage could be really annoying. For me, one of the plug works perfectly and another sucks, I tried over 5 times with different instructions from the manufacturer, still didn't work out. If that's the case, don't hesitate to contact them. The product is good overall, but can still be improved.","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/ios) (15A 2Pack)"
Excellent wifi switch,5.0 ,"These wifi switches are so simple to setup and reliable.

It works great but directions are extra frustrating.,4.0 ,"Product works great, but the directions that come with it are abysmal. Manufacturer, please redo your directions, they are complete garbage. This does connect to Alexa, directions to follow. For those of you as frustrated as I was, light your directions included in the product on fire and use these: 1.) download the ""Smart Life"" app. 2.) install your plugs on the app. To do so, you will require your wifi passcode. I used the manual setup (AP Mode), as ""magic"" was a joke. Manually set up your plug according to the instructions on the app. To get to AP mode, there is a button on the top right of the app that says ""AP"". Click that and follow prompts, but it works just like when you set up echo dot in that you have to set your phone to your wifi, then to the device wifi to recognize it. This was by far the easier set up. 3.) open Alexa app. Go to ""smart home"". Go to ""add skills"". Search ""smart life"". Click ""enable skills"" 4.) still in Alexa, go to devices. Click ""discover devices"". Your previously loaded plug or plugs from smart life should populate. Add to Alexa. 5.) you can now voice control devices. Should you want to control several at once (Alexa, turn on living room lights) then create a group within Alexa and add the individual devices to that group. Eureka. Done.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
Couldn't get it to work with Alexa at first.(updated title & review),4.0 ,"The product works as advertised with the KMC and Smart Life apps (I tried both). After being on the line with Amazon for an hour, I still couldn‚Äôt get it to work with my Echo Dot. I reached out to the manufacturer, but haven‚Äôt heard anything yet. I‚Äôll post an update once I hear from them. Update 1: After a couple of days, just when I was about to give up, I opened the Alexa app and my Echo found the plug. It now works perfectly. I'm going to give this another chance and order another plug. I'll post an update when I get it. Update 2: The second plug arrived and it works perfectly with my app and with Alexa. I'm adding a star.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
Easy setup and works well,5.0 ,"This is a pretty standard WiFi enabled smart outlet that is easy to setup and works great. I did not end up looking at the directions because it worked perfectly the first time with the smart app (TuyaSmart) that I have been using for my other smart devices. Setup was as easy as making sure the led was flashing (it already was when I plugged it in the first time), clicking on the add device option in the Tuya app and selecting Electrical outlet. There was a spinner for 20 seconds or so and then I added the outlet and I could control it through either the button on the front or through the smart phone app. The app also lets you set up schedules as well as hook it up to Amazon Alexa or Google Home (although I haven't tried either of these). This smart plug uses the very common ESP8266 platform to enable WiFi connectivity, which also means it is re-programmable for people with some DIY electronics experience. But that is definitely not required to use this device for what it was meant for.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Giving 5 stars but setup had issues, works well after",5.0 ,"It was admittedly frustrating to connect it at first because the app has issues.. I got a connection error over and over until I switched to AP mode (took at least 10 attempts), made further frustrating by the fact that I have dual-band wifi and use the 5ghz because the 2.4ghz mode that this product uses is very congested. But once I got it going I was really impressed with the power monitoring feature.. it is incredibly sensitive and accurate! I tested a lot of appliances out of curiosity, it was able to detect changes in energy consumption to the tenth of a watt and by a milliamp. Setting up Alexa was pretty easy although the app didn't provide this feature so I had to do it manually. Also would be nice if it supported 5ghz wifi and third-party interaction like Apple's smart home.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Fast response time, excellent app, and solid integration with Google Home and Echo = WIN",5.0 ,"The instructions are pretty hard to follow, but the crazy thing is that the device is super easy to set up on Android using the KMC Smart app. In fact, just toss the directions, download the app and muddle your way through it. Also, it is ridiculously easy to set up voice control with Amazon Echo using the KMC Smart smart home skill. But the easiest by far is setting it up on Google Home ... the only trick there is that you use the ""Smart Life"" service. And the thing that I love the most about this little switch is how fast it is. Make the voice command or hit the button on your phone and it will turn the plug on or off within 1 second. Really impressive response time! Now I can remotely control the power to a device I keep in a corner of the garage. I am so happy.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Connects easily, works great",5.0 ,"I have a ton of wifi Alexa connectable smart plugs but this is my first KMC and sofar i like it. It uses the same app as another of my plugs so that's extra nice as I don't need as many random smart home apps on my phone. Connecting was easy and it turns on as soon as you 0ress the button in the app. It also has timer functions and a few other app features. It came with two instruction books, I have no idea why, but it's like all the other plugs so setup isn't too hard once you've downloaded the app. It works great and connects well, five stars.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
Works great with the app and easy to set up,5.0 ,"This plug works great for me. I already have the surge protector by this brand and saw the outlet plug so I had to have it.

The only issue I wish I could figure out is how to use it with my ""ok Google"" feature on my phone. Other than that it works flawlessly. I will probably buy another one or two so I can have a semi smart home . Great product and can't wait to have more. Buy it now and you will not be disappointed.

Good smart device.,4.0 ,"This device is very sleek and doesn't look bulky. The reason for the 4 stars is because it took two days to get it set up to where it would work on my echo. It took 1 day to get it paired to my phone and the next day to get it to work on my echo. This also may have been the fault of the operator. I do have it connected now so the next one I buy I shouldn't have any trouble. The price is half of others that I have priced, so it is worth the money even if it took me a little more time. Yes I would recommend.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"

Just follow the installation instructions, and you'll find it to be very easy to get the plug linked and then being able to use voice commands to turn your appliance on or off.

Was concerned whether or not my wifi would even reach these plugs because it's so far away, (about 50 yards from my router, and through walls, etc...) but had zero problems.

Voice control for Google Home,5.0 ,"When I first received my devices (I ordered 2) I was excited. After getting them hooked up to my 2.4 GHZ network they would work in the app just perfect. That being said I really wanted them to integrate with my Google Home. After multiple attempts and frustration, I finally responded to the seller based on feedback form other post. Given the seller is in China, I received a response early in the morning. At 6:00 AM ET we exchanged multiple emails and the response was very fast. The seller admitted to needing to get back to me with some additional details and they responded the next day with the notes below. After looking at the initial notes I thought this was the same process I had seen all over the web, but alas, step 14 was key.

Google then brings in the Smart Life voice and ask what she can do for you. Attached is a video of me turning off and on my office lamp.

I used to have to move a credenza to reset a camera, but now I can just tell Alexa to turn the cam off and on which resets it without me having to move. I also have one on my mattress warmer so if in the middle of the night I get chilly, I can tell Alexa to turn it on.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"

"Works, but was a hassle to set up due to bad firmware version.",3.0 ,"I purchased this item from Amazon on January 9th, as a pre-order from when they were released as a new item on January 10th, 2017. After receiving two defective units from Amazon, and before returning the second, I decided to play around with it more and do some more research online. I am posting this to help anyone else who purchased this and is having trouble getting it to connect to your local WiFi network. I did get the unit working fine, but I removed two stars from my review because of the hassle of getting it to work. I spent over an hour with WeMo tech support, who offered no solutions, and made me jump through a bunch of hoops in the process. Cycling a reboot of my router did nothing. Changing my WiFi password did nothing. Disconnecting my phone from cellular service did nothing. The issue with these early units lies in the fact that they seem to get ""confused"" if you have other WeMo devices in your home. When trying to set up this WeMo mini, the WeMo app on my iPhone would find the device after I connected to its WiFi. The screen would show the device, ask me to name it, and click ""Next"". After clicking next, it would get stuck trying to get the device to find my home WiFi network. I have 4 other ""older"" WeMo devices (none of which ever had any issue connecting). I have a WeMo light switch, and 3 regular WeMo smart plugs. Two of the other WeMo smart plugs were easily accessible, so I tried completely unplugging them (not just turning them off). I did a factory reset on the WeMo mini I purchased, went through the app process of connecting it again, and voila! It immediately found my WiFi network and connected. And then it immediately downloaded a firmware update. So it seems like WeMo is aware of an issue, yet their tech support wasn't informed. And so far, I seem to be the only one publicly acknowledging the issue with these early release devices and buggy firmware. So long story short, if you have other WeMo devices in your household, and have trouble getting this WeMo mini to connect, try unplugging as many of the other devices as you can (they will automatically reconnect online after you plug them back in), factory reset the mini, and go through the setup process again. It should hopefully work.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Bought one and like it so much I kept buying more.,5.0 ,"This light switch and the other outlet style plug has worked reliably for over 3 years. There would be occasional hiccups like power interruptions that cause the switches to restart, but they have never failed on me. However, you are at the mercy of your internet connection and if you happen to be away while the network crashes, you won't be able to communicate with the switches. The daily programs will continue to work regardless. Setting this up properly does require some networking knowledge and how to properly implement security. The switches both work on hidden and broadcasted SSID Wifi networks. Half of my switches work on the hidden SSID and the other half are connected to the broadcasted SSID. They do support security password keys, but if you want an extra layer of protection, turn on your basestation's MAC address check to enable access to your Wifi network. I have assigned static IP address to these switches to avoid conflict when power cycling happens to my router. This is the general rule for all of my stay-at-home devices. Update 2017 My eleventh switch will be arriving tomorrow. The first switch I bought in 2013 is still working to this day. All switches are still working reliably. Works perfectly with NEST thermostat, Amazon Echo and IFTTT for voice control.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Worked well for ~2 months,1.0 ,"I bought 4 of these light switches about a month after they were released. I had been adding motion detector lights, dusk-to-dawn lights, etc., to both improve energy efficiency and safety in my house. My purchase was designed to move further toward both of these issues, along with a new Kwikset lock and some security cameras. Installation was relatively simple, even for someone who is not an electrician. As long as you have the proper wires and follow instructions, as other reviewers have mentioned, installation should not be too difficult (check before ordering though). Connecting to the WiFi was also not difficult for me. I have a Linksys router in the basement with a Linksys range extender upstairs and WeMo did not have any problems connecting when I followed instructions. The initial firmware update took quite a long time and the initial iPhone app version that I downloaded was *very* slow to detect the switches each time I loaded the app, but they seem to have fixed the latter issue. Once it was all setup, I LOVED it. I used IFTTT to automatically make sure lights were turned off at night and on in the morning, among other things. I really like the look of them and changed out many of my fan switches and other switches to the decorator-style to make it look even nicer. Really, really like the look of them, although I could see it not fitting as well in certain instances (I am definitely not an interior decorator). I do wish that these would work with 3-way lights (where you have two light switches that control the same light) or as dimmers, but unfortunately they don't. Here's the problem: two days ago, the power to the router went out for about 30 seconds, then turned back on. The internet and WiFi loaded fine and all of my devices worked fine - except two of the 4 light switches could no longer connect to WiFi! They would both just blink orange non-stop. I tried all of their support instructions on their website, which was minimal, and included resetting and restarting the device. Of course, now one of the switches started blinking green and I could no longer even turn the lights on manually. So I caved and called their support number (difficult to find, but calling the corporate headquarters 800-number routed me to support). Here is where it got really frustrating because, among other things, the person on the line spoke very poor English. It took about 35 minutes to get through the initial questions around model number, what lights were blinking, when I purchased the product, etc. In between each question, she would tell me to ""hold on a second"" and mute her line, before often (at least 10 times, no exaggeration) returning and asking me a question I had already answered. Multiple times, she forgot to mute her line and I heard her joking with her friends. But, OK, I only hold Belkin partially accountable for that. After over an hour, and having me try everything I already tried, she finally said she would send me a new one. For now, I have two switches that cannot connect to WiFi and one that cannot even turn the lights on. It is simply not worth all of this hassle just to be able to remotely turn some lights on and off. To make it worse: they only provide (poor) customer service for free for 90 days! After that, you have to pay to talk to someone. Luckily (unluckily?), mine broke after 60 days so I could get someone on the phone. I really wanted to like the product, and I would have if there was some quality control or better customer support, but unfortunately for me it didn't work out.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"I really wanted to like it, but the failure rate & modes are shockingly high & incompatible with safe, sustained use (updates)",1.0 ,"I really, really wanted to like this product & technology, but the failure modes and failure rates are astoundingly high. Relevant background to my skill levels: I bought a couple of the plugs so that I could experiment with how to automate my home. I am neither a software or hardware engineer, however I am a (very highly) qualified engineer and I have self taught myself a lot about network hardware & application of software packages. I have an advanced router with repeater, fully LAN & WAN connected house, with network switches, POE devices etc. that I installed & runs pretty cleanly. First of all the app - I am still on 2nd level support waiting for a response to an issue where I am patient zero. I can create a rule, but it does not give me the choice of days. It is the same rule every day or no rule at all. I have tried installing the app on 2 i devices, same issue(the even have different itunes accounts to further firewall them from each other) So the app is highly buggy. App version 1.17.1. 2nd, the switch(es) I have RMA'ed one of my 2 as I still could, the first one I am stuck with. The 2nd one experienced worse functionality issues than the first one. It had to go as this is a defective unit. The rules limited me, so I tried anyway. Initial first time setup was quite smooth & I was initially impressed. (Hadn't realized the rules issues yet) Paired it to Alexa, that was pretty smooth too (Still impressed) Ran it for a few days, had fun having Alexa switch it on & off etc. Then we had a power outage. Big system failure on the WEMO. After restarting power, everything else came back up properly. I tried restarting the first switch (the still semi functional one that is not RMA'ed) several times to see if it would boot up, it actually would not boot up until I had pushed the power button several times & actually physically unplugged & replugged it several times. The WEMO devices were not recognized by the app on my phone, until I switched it to the same wifi network as they were running on. This i snot helpful when you are trying to make a remote access switch. So after trying & rebooting I have given up. I cannot set up a smart house with devices that require a full factory reboot and me to delete the app, reset all rules from scratch, every time the power fails or blips. So sadly I have to say the devices are junk, the app is junk and they need to be fully redesigned before both parts of the system become stable & reliable. Sorry Belkin, but you also have a lot of people on your own Community pages with many similar problems & your own support is not the one finding solutions, it is other users who have more time to do this than most of the rest of us have. So, folks, if you read this far, don't waste your time & money, these devices are great in concept, but are far from Implementation Ready for mainstream use. I have never been paid to write a review - good or bad and I have never been given anything for a review, except for one thing that was sent to me that I didn't want & I contacted the vendor & asked for an RMA (They said donate it - so I did). What you read is my genuine experience. Sadly 1 star reviews get pushed out of sight on Amazon & they are hard to access (even your own ones). Thanks for your time. Updated 3/17 to add rules screenshot showing the app issue with no days selectable. App version 1.17.1 (420001) that I am trying to deal with on 2nd level support. I still struggle with the concept that I am the only person with this issue & that it is identical on 2 unrelated Apple devices that are on different accounts. Just a side note - when Customers are on the phone with your reps, when discussing the product, it really makes a better impression of your company when they are aware of who your major competitor(s) are. 1st level support had never even heard of TP Link (check the recording it you don't believe me). 3/30/2017 update. I found a workaround out of sheer frustration & anger &, well, it is still strange. I had a blank screen for the days selection when creating rules. Nothing showed up at all, ever, I have deleted & reinstalled the app 3 times, done a full hardware reset on the switches 3+ times, had Belkin 2nd level support on the phone - you name it. (That was a whole different story - see the response comments!) So I was giving it one last try to see if it would work, I reinstalled everything from scratch. Set up a new rule - still nothing snowing in the days area of the screen. So I was really very angry about how much time & energy I had spent on this whole exercise & I was absentmindedly tapping my phone screen repeatedly, when I suddenly noticed that it was highlighting days of the week. So I played around some more. I can get it to highlight, at most, 6 of 7 days, in any combination. I have to guess where the day is to be selected on the screen, then I can find it. I sometimes have to tap that spot several times to get the day to select (no it is not my touchscreen, both devices have the same response) What I then found out was, if I select a day & I can now see it, that means that day is one in which the rule will NOT work. It Will work on the days that are not selected & still invisible on the screen. I have attached a couple of random screen shots so you can see what is going on. Is the issue fixed - no, not at all, it is still there & the software still has a huge flaw. Does it work enough that I want to continue to try to experiment with it - yes Will I want to see a software update to fix this issue - yes Do I want to continue to use this switch for the short term - yes So in short, I will not send it back, yet. There is something going on. I tried this workaround on 2 different Apple products (Iphone 6 & Ipad Mini 3) and the workaround works on both. Is it still fatally flawed - yes. Please can you pass this on to your 2nd or even higher level Engineers as there is still a problem that must get fixed, but this is a partial workaround. By the way, I also tried changing the screen color settings to see if it was screen contrast or color related - no it is not, the Apple devices are working exactly as they should, it is your software with the bug. If you want me to try anything else, have your engineers get in touch & we can see what we can do. I have still lost significant confidence in the product & am very unsure if I want to invest in any more of them to automate other parts of my home at this time.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Not very responsive to touch, was missing from my wemo account on iPad for several days",3.0 ,"We've been waiting for a wemo dimmer to be released for a while now. We have four other wemo devices in the house and have never had a single issue with them. This one is a bit different, though. Installation was a breeze, and we got it added to our wemo account within minutes of installing it. The only issue was that it didn't show up on our iPads (wemo iPhone app) for several days, while it was listed on our iPhones almost immediately. Eventually it showed up on our iPads, so I'm glad that's not an issue anymore. The other issue is I can't figure out how to best control the capacitive touch slider. If I tap on the brightness level dot that I want, nothing happens. If I slide my finger up and down the brightness level indicator, usually nothing happens. Sometimes it will work, and sometimes it won't. Thankfully using the iOS app is pretty reliable, so I usually set the dimming level through that. Good first attempt Belkin, but please create a Universal iPhone and iPad app for wemo, and please fix the capacitive touch slider.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Wonderful switch once installed.,4.0 ,"Once you get this linked up with the app, it's fantastic! I've yet to experience any cutoffs or problems. It works well with Alexa and we love how it also functions as a regular switch. There are a couple of issues, however. It's deep - we had to buy a wall extender so that it ""covers"" how far it extends from the wall due to how it doesn't wholly fit inside the switch box. I hadn't realized how deep the switch box was until I tried to jam it in with the wires and a box. Once you do get it installed, which we did neatly with our extender, it then took forever to get it synced with the app (about an hour). I solved this issue (after searching online and trying all the suggestions) by moving our wifi router closer. The wall switch was in the kitchen so there was a wall between the switch and the router. I moved the router slightly closer (yet still in the living room) and it linked just fine. I don't think the router should be nearly in the same room as the switch (it's for the house with rooms), but I'm glad that the fix was very simple. The instructions are horribly simple and were of no use (another thing the company should change since it's obvious it's more complicated than they imply).I would recommend the switch, but I also suggest a lot of patience with installation.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Love the Alexa integration; Wemo's dimming capabilities not so much,3.0 ,"I had been in the market for a Wi-Fi enabled dimmer to control 6 recessed lights in my family room for several months and was excited to see that the Wemo Dimmer announced earlier in the year at CES 2017 was finally becoming available. I had also recently purchased an Amazon Echo, so wanted to combine the voice control capabilities Alexa provides as an added plus. The unboxing was exciting and it seemed more like a smart phone channeling Apple with the minimalist packaging and polished aluminum back to the device (plus 1). The instructions were pretty straightforward and having changed out other switches in my home over the years I felt comfortable doing so. The instructions even led you through what to do if you need to swap the hot and load lines which (even though there is a 50% change of getting it right the first time) always seem to get reversed (plus 1). After installation and confirming that the switch in fact did control the lights, my next step was to connect it up to my Wi-Fi using the Wemo app on my iPhone. This is were things started to get more complex. Having just configured my Echo using a similar approach, I was familiar with how to attach to the Wemo device from the Wi-Fi control panel and then open the app to finish the configuration. This is where I got stuck with either the app crashing part way through the process or the app being unable to connect to the Wemo. Tried many different approaches (power cycling the switch, restarting the app, etc.). I was finally able to get it to work by trying from another device, but this too required several attempts (minus 1). Finally, I was able to get the app configured and then was able to set the bulb type and dimmer range. This is where I had my biggest disappointment with the product. About six months ago I had converted the incandescent cans into LED fixtures and had no problem controlling the dimming using my previous analog dimmer switch. Was able to dim to I would estimate around 10% of full brightness with an analog switch. The Wemo Dimmer gives you the capability to configure the type of bulb (LED, CFL, or incandescent) in the app and then adjust the minimum and maximum brightness to ensure you have smooth dimming with no annoying flashing. Unfortunately, I was only able to get Wemo to dim my lights to around 50% of their full brightness before they would strobe/flash. This seemed like pretty poor dimming performance compared to my previous analog switch (minus 2). Overall, I love the Alexa integration but was frankly disappointed by the performance of the dimmer. At the time I looked, this seemed to be the only dimmer product that was Wi-Fi enabled with Alexa, so will stick with it for now, but really only have ""bright"" and ""brightest"" for my end range of controllable light levels.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Works very with little set up.. Could have better detail docs on app and perhaps US support team.,4.0 ,"I purchased 4 mini plugs. Started to install them in an environment that has two wireless routers linked together. The first went in just as expected..I took the second to our bedroom but it would not connect. I called customer support and they were of little help. Language barrier. Being somewhat knowledgeable about networks I took the second unit to the same plug where I attached the first. It loaded up quick and correctly. I then took unit 2 back to the bedroom and it continues to work, then after looking at app and lack of documentation on details I noted a small switch that says use same setup as previous units. This works fine unless you have multi routers then you have to turn this switch off so you can pick a different router I plan on expanding my WeMo system through the house. The app is very good and simple Love the link from amazon-echo.. can even use the amazon remote to turn light on and off. One question.

Total frustration,1.0 ,"I was excited to try out this product. It was one of the best sellers on Amazon and seemed to have a decent rating as far as smart plugs go. What I wound up getting was one of the most disappointing tech experiences I can ever recall having. Out of the box, there are effectively no instructions other than to check out the Wemo website, which is basically an ad for more Wemo products. Once you figure out that you need to install the mobile app, you can start *attempting* to get this thing to connect to wifi. I say attempting, because, despite sitting in the same room as the access point, it consistently refuses to connect to anything. After Googling and finding a lot of similar problem reports (blinking amber light, no connectivity), I quickly mastered the ""reset"" technique. I was able to achieve a wifi connection after resetting and reconfiguring, and at one point after a number of attempts, got it fully working (I thought). It sat for maybe an hour or two, until I went to show my spouse the new gadget... and found it had fallen off the network. Back to square one. The app at one point managed to tell me there was a firmware update available. It didn't offer this the first few times through setup, and there's no way to check directly, but it didn't matter, because the firmware update never successfully installed. It would start installing, then inevitably wind up back in ""no network"" blinking mode until you again reset it and started the whole process over again. Maybe the firmware update would have made it work better... no way to tell. As far as the (Android) app goes, it's fairly awful in and of itself. Clunky UI, hard to navigate, lots of freezing, and just severely buggy. The poor rating in the Play Store suggests I'm not alone in feeling this way. Despite a successful career in technology that includes mobile support and networking, after several hours I could not get this device to work. It's shocking to me that they would bring such a poorly executed product to market. I'm not the kind of person who returns products after purchasing, but I returned this as unusable. I'll be avoiding Wemo products in the future.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Terrible app, decent device with an Echo. Try Zwave or Zigbee",2.0 ,"So I bought a bunch of these way back when. I had about 6 of these and 8 light switches. Turns out there was a limit to how many you could have on a network and they started failing. I had to replace every single one with a zwave switch and device and have been muuuuuuch happier. But I came up with a way to add more custom commands to my Echo and I needed some dummy devices to switch on and off to fool the Echo into thinking it was doing what I wanted it to do. So I dug out my old Wemo devices to see if there was any improvement in firmware and operation. It turns out that the devices work better with the Amazon Echo than they do with their own app. The app is by far the worst smarthome app I have ever used. They functionality is extremely limited and the devices keep showing as failed. The app has to be reset in order to operate see the devices again. The Echo however seems to work flawlessly with them. So I may have found my solution to my dummy switch situation. But I would not put anything reliable on these devices, as they tend to just shut off when they lose a wifi signal. My biggest issue right now is that my Echo is finding all my old devices in the Wemo database and there is no way to clear it out so they stop showing up and they are starting to conflict with the names of the replacement devices. Anytime I add something new, I have to manually clear out the offline devices. Still waiting on an answer from Belkin about this issue. If anyone has a solution, please chime in.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Excellent first smart home device (after Echo Dot),4.0 ,"Pros: Controlling with Alexa is amazing. Controlling with a timer is amazing. Controlling with an app on phone/tablet is cool (not amazing haha. Just not as useful as the other two). Setup is easy if you do okay with technology (will have you connect to switch WiFi directly at first). Android, iOS, Kindle app support. Seeing electricity usage is nice (I don't think I would pay extra for this feature, when I can get a dedicated device for much less when I need it). More attractive than most of the other smart switches. Can switch on/off using physical touch sensor. Can control remotely through app. IFTT support. Nest support. Continued firmware updates being pushed out (This is very important to me. Was one of the main reasons I chose Wemo to start my smart switch ecosystem. It means security isn't just totally being thrown to the wayside. That's what many ""Internet of Things"" [hate that phrase, btw] manufacturers are doing, so it's nice to see Belkin supporting the devices. I hope they truly continue to do so. Plus, it can mean added functionality). Cons: Too tall to allow something to be plugged in on the above wall outlet (has some depth too, maybe a couple inches, so it'll stick out some). No Z-wave or Zigbee support. No iPad app; must use iPhone version. No web app. App will frequently ""lose"" the switches. Expensive for an on/off switch. Pros OR Cons: Actually white--not eggshell or whatever. Matches white walls better. Uses WiFi only. Addictive. I like the app for the most part; it's easy to use. I just wish Belkin would update the GUI and add iPad support. I use these mainly for my lamps right now. I have two sets of two lamps each hooked up to a switch so they turn on at the same time. For the other two individual lamps, I kinda wish I bought smart bulbs because I think it might be cheaper in the long run. Oh well, still worth the premium for the functionality I get, IMO. Although, if this is a higher price than the new mini plug Belkin just released, I would go with that instead.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"

Anyways. I like this, have it on a fridge and it led me to get rid of an older horribly inefficient fridge and buy a newer one which will pay for itself in 1-2 yrs. BIG problem though .... if the power goes out, this thing does not turn power back onto the device. We had a power blip and I noticed later that day water on the floor cause the fridge was defrosting. They need to fix that - a setting to turn on automatically after a power outtage. This works well in the App, can see usage, avg, cost, etc. Nice. **************** Lighting Starter Set Review ************** I also bought the starter lighting set (2 bulbs and plug in controller). I stayed wtih WeMo, because their lights dim on a timer, so I can set the light in my kids room to turn off and it dims as it nears the time out. Pretty cool! Just like the Switch I mention previously ... the hardware is good, the App is horrible. The lights take a couple extra seconds to show up in the app (I can live with that). But the way you have to click on a tiny triangle icon to open the dimming and timer settings is HORRIBLE! I end up clicking at least 10 times to get it to open. Why it isn't a hold or swipe control!! So frustrating! And when I turn on the light the dimmer setting automatically opens (that's good). But I have to close it and reopen (clicking 10 times) to get the dimming and timer control open. So frustrating! Belkin, you have a great product, please FIX the app! **************** Light Switch Review ************** I have installed two of these switches in my home. Both for outside lights. Mechanically, they work OK. I don't like that they squeak when you press the button (sounds like a noisy spring inside, maybe it is), but hopefully it works itself in. There is a small light on the switch so you can see if it on or off without having to see the light (mine are outside). Installation was straight forward. They actually supply good wire-ties to use and good packaging & instructions. Keep in mind you need a white wire and this device is very deep. So it may not fit in smaller boxes and may still be a tight fit in medium sized boxes. Software/App works...but is feature poor. When it comes to smart devices, I've come to expect very good software (i.e compare to Nest thermostat) There is no web control option (i.e. from a PC). Access is only from the app on the phone that you set it up with. The GUI is basic. The initial set-up/connecting takes some time, but is OK if you follow the instructions. After set up, the phone App (on my Android) is decent at best. It always takes 5+ secs to connect each time. It is then simple to turn the switch on/off, but the rules are a bit confusing to set and have some bugs (like going past midnight). The ""Away"" option is horribly documented and I'm not sure how it works or if it even works. To be effective it should allow you to set a window for when it randomly turns on and then another for when it turns off. I had a 4 hr window on 2 devices and could never find a time when either light was on (viewing status from my phone). I cannot comment on the IFTTT functionality. It sounds cool, but I haven't had any time to sign up and play around with it. Overall this is a good switch to control a light switch from your phone. But it lacks all the extra features and GUI innovations I've come to expect from other smart home devices.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Gateway Drug to Full Home Automation!,5.0 ,"We recently purchased a new house which does not have overhead lighting in every room yet. We were constantly leaving on of the floor lamps on in our office and decided it was bet to purchase a timer like I had on the lights in my house when I was a kid. Timers were around $10, and this Wemo showed up in the list for $30. We decided to give it a try. Setup was super easy, pretty much the same process as setting up an Echo. You are asked to download an app, plugin the Wemo, connect your wifi to the Wemo, and run through the setup process. After you run the install, the Switch works by either pressing the button on the unit or the button on the app. I then adjusted the timer and schedule functions to turn the light on automatically at the times that we use the Office. Even with just these features, the Wemo was already beyond worth the money. However, I went on to open the Alexa app and have Alexa search for the Outlet, again a simple setup. After this quick setup, I can now tell Alexa to turn on or off the Office light and she instantly makes the change. With Alexa and the timer running the light, I am now determined to automate the rest of my house. I will be purchasing several of these as well as a few wall switches to control the other rooms. This is truly a Gateway product to Full home automation. Bonus: You can also Use IFTTT.com to set up rules to trigger the light to turn on based on other events happening such as getting an email or posting on Facebook, etc. The trigger works the other way too where you can actually log every time that the light is turned on in a spreadsheet.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
You better be technology savy if you want to use this.,3.0 ,"I had a very difficult time getting it to work. First I thought that my Wi-Fi wasn't right and I needed 5gb not 2.4, but then despite all the people on the Belkin site telling others what to do, nothing worked for me. I had a friend or should I say my tech support guy at least see if it was working. So when he determine it worked ok, then I brought it home. I don't like the lack of instructions. I don't like how the connectivity is shown on the cell phone looks. One time I can see the WeMo Mini then the next time it was there. I had to do a hard reset a few times. Finally, I tried using the other network and put in my Wi-Fi name and password and it finally worked. I haven't decided exactly what to hook it up to yet, but I do know that I can control things while we aren't at home. I tested that with a fan while at a friends house and it did turn it on. Was the frustration worth the money. NO. But I shall see in the future when I determine what I want to control. If you purchase this I hope you are tech savvy or have friends that are. Apparently the Wemo tech support will run you through all the things that others have tried and still not connected. I was one step from returning this and getting a different brand.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
GREAT WIFI Switch,5.0 ,"GREAT WIFI Switch AND just as important , if you have a white home (as I do) it looks very good ! Easy to Install Connected Switches to my WIFI one at a time. By the second one , I was an expert. It might not install on the First try ... but it will :) Also simular install to my WIFI A.C. (Frigidare). You need to SEE and Connect the device First to your WIFI access point. ""Then"" the APP can do the rest. * NOW I need an APP that shows ALL my different Brands in ONE APP. Sometimes it does take more than one try to Install via WIFI APP. But once done. It works reliably. * Note: I have a WIFI repeater (boosts WIFI signal) on the 2nd floor of my home. So my WIFI signal is pretty strong everywhere. Out of 4 switches that I bought ( also, recently bought 6 more ) .. so now I am using 10 WEMO switches. on just one , the LED green On light was Dim (but, the switch did work) .. on a three light panel it is noticable (side by side) Amazon , quickly Re-Shiped for the Exchange. Love Amazon. :) * The WEMO APP does NOT seem to let you GROUP switches on a SEPARATE LINE in the APP So, you can Turn it ALL OFF with one button Push.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Finally, an easy to install, configure and use smart home device",5.0 ,"I've been waiting a long, long time to purchase any connected home devices because I didn't want to bet on which communications protocol would win (Zigbee, Z-wave) and have to deal only with devices that use that protocol. I prefer IP-based devices that just connect to my wifi. After reading a lot of the reviews on the Wemo smart plug, I decided to dive into the ""smart"" home world. The Wemo was easy to install and configure, and the app is very user friendly. I purchased these for lamps in different rooms of our house. One of the big reasons I purchased them is for when we're away. Not only can I control it from the app while I'm gone, but I can set timers or activate the random setting. The plugs also connect to my Amazon Echo, which has been one of the uses for my Echo. I just tell my Echo to turn on or off the light, and it says ""Ok"" in a very pleasant voice and does what I ask. My wife and I laugh that it's the only thing in our house that says ""Ok"" when we ask it to do something. If only our children would do that, life would be perfect! I've since added a Wemo light switch for my front porch light and plan to add others throughout our house.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
I wanted a quick and easy way to control more devices in our home,5.0 ,"I wanted a quick and easy way to control more devices in our home. We already have our Amazon Echo hooked up to our thermostat and lights. These Wemo Mini smart plugs give us basic on/off control and scheduling of things like our entertainment centers and more lights. I'm hoping future updates to the software will allow more flexible programming. For example- a critical use for US is keeping our kid from watching too much TV. Sometimes she wakes up very early and slips downstairs to start watching. That could mean she's been watching TV for a couple of hours before we come down! So I have the Wemo Mini set on a schedule to avoid that. The switch allows you to set an amount of time something stay on when you turn it on. This is great again for TV: if you tell your child they've got 30 minutes watch a show- CLICK- it shuts down after 30. However, it seems that you can't add this function on top of an existing schedule. I wish the system can have a scheduled routine- but still allow me to set a timer to turn off after a specified time. I also wish I could use Wemo with my iPhone. Overall this product is exactly what I needed in our home. Looking forward to using more of them for holiday lighting, etc!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Need a negative range of 1-5 stars. (Update),3.0 ,"Been buying the Wemo plugs for 3 or 4 years. No longer can you buy them on Amazon. I got this one in place of the original Wemo plug. It's like Belkin thought, how can we screw this up, we had a fine product, but you know what?? Lets totally redesign it, raise the price, and it will work like total poo. And not just any ordinary poo, poo back from the Jurassic period. I have 7 or 8 Wemos, I am on the verge of taking them all and throwing them in the fire pit. And I don't even have the updated firmware everyone is carring on about not to get. Poor poor design Belkin, did anyone even test this poo, before you shipped it??? Update: I have moved this into my living room, and while its not 100% it is a lot better than when it was in the bedroom. I am not certain if there was a distance issue, but moving it seems to have helped. I was also contacted by Belkin support asking to help. I did appreciate the effort to contact me, and have done everything they could to assist me. I have also increased my stars for this product to 3, as its about 90% at a much closer range. My bedroom is on the same level as the wireless, and only about 20-25 feet away, through 3 walls, perhaps something was throwing it off. However, the older models do work fine in the same location.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Inconsistent quality,3.0 ,"This works great when it works. I ordered 3 and 1 out of the 3 can not hold a network connection consistently. The other two seem to be ok. They are all plugged in near each other. The one that can not hold a connection said it needed a firmware update, which i did. But that didn't help. The other 2 did not need an update. The 2 that work well are awesome!!!!! I set up groups with my Echo and lights go on/off in the group or as individual, depending on how i give the command. it is actually brilliant. Hopefully quality bugs will get worked out and there will be more consistent quality. In the meantime, I will return the defective unit and order a new one and hope that one works better.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Love it!,5.0 ,"Love it! Voice control when you enable the Alexa skill works very well, regardless of what you name each plug/device. I actually think Alexa/voice response may work better and more consistently than the Android app, but the app does have great features and is very useful to have. So far, I've integrated two of these - one for a free standing room fan and one for a living room light. I'll definitely be adding more! One note, turning off the smart plug is the same as unplugging the device, so make sure that the device you want to use with the smart plug has a mechanical on/off switch. Devices with an electronic switch or standby power mode won't work properly or at all with the smart plug. For example unplugging your Keurig coffee maker always sets the electronic on/off switch state to Off, so when power is reapplied, it requires the power button be pressed to turn it On. Smart TVs are another example, using the remote to turn them ""off"" typically puts them in a low power, standby mode so they come on quicker. Smart plugs aren't usable in either case. That said, plan accordingly and these are great add-ons for your home automation.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Great way to smarten up a dumb device,4.0 ,"Just got two of these to use with my Google Home. They work great, and the Google Home integration works better than the native Belkin app. The only issue I have is when one gets disconnected by accident (manually flip the wall switch it's plugged into, unplugging it by mistake, etc) the other one sometimes gets disconnected when the first one comes back on. They seem pretty stable now, but there's definitely a little bug somewhere that can cause a disconnection at times when you have multiple minis in the house. I tried using a Hue lamp in my home office, but it just wasn't bright enough, so I went back to my old, not smart halogen lamp. But now I plugged that lamp into the mini and I can control it with my voice or an app on my phone. Instant smart lamp.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Not sure if recommended use case?,3.0 ,"I'd like to write this review to answer a question I had that went unanswered until I bought the device. It does indeed work on a cheater plug. That is to say that you can use it on an older outlet that has no ground. Not sure if there is a safety concern there but I am sure that I can now control my bathroom fan by voice. Thanks Alexa! Worthy of note, it takes a good minute or two for the WeMo to respond to commands after it has lost power. This is relevant to me because I have a single light switch in my bathroom that controls power to both fan and lights. This was problematic when I wanted to put smart bulbs in my house. To turn off the fan I had to flip the switch. And then I couldn't control the lights anymore... the fan plugs into an old style socket with no ground mounted in the housing with the fan. No idea if that's common? It's the only ungrounded socket in my apartment. Sometimes I still flip the switch out of habit and, there goes fan control for a couple minutes... Anywho the cheater plug let me attach the WeMo to the ungrounded socket and then the fan. Hooray. I even set the WeMo to turn the fan back off after sixty minutes in case I ever forget it on. And also to turn off when my Nest thermostat detects that I've left the house. Neat. Now if only I could get it to turn on to the sound of fart noises...","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Love it - except when I *REALLY* hate it,3.0 ,"I've had this for just over a year. When it works, it's fantastic. When the sunrise / sunset rules quit working or when it (seemingly randomly) loses connection with wifi (we live in a small townhome with a STRONG wifi signal) -- then I want to rip it out of the wall and smash it. The Belkin site has rather unclear instructions regarding how to reset. The Android app is a truly abysmal user experience. That said, I still like this better vs the timer switch we used at our last house. When this works, it is wonderful to have the outdoor light automatically come on at sunset and turn off at sunrise. I estimate that I've had to do a reset 5-10 times during the past year. Each time I spend about 30 minutes practicing a very limited vocabulary until the stars somehow align and the IoT gods see fit to again bless me with a functional and connected switch.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Great Wemo functionality, but limited wiring instructions",5.0 ,"I already own several Wemo switches to control lamps around the house as well as the coffee machine. I'm very pleased at how well they work and how they integrate with my Amazon Echo. When there was a one-day sale on this switch, I grabbed one. So a brief explanation. The existing switch I wanted to replace with the Wemo controlled the light for the ceiling fan in my office. The switch above it controlled the fan itself. There were no rheostats or anything complicated. My goal was to be able to have the light turn on and off when I'm traveling to give the house a ""lived-in"" look. I'm experienced with changing switches and outlets, so I wasn't intimidated by the installation, but I was a bit confused by the directions. The switch I was replacing was a simple Leviton on/off switch with one red and one black wire. There was no ground and there was a common bundle. The Wemo instructions want you to bridge the black cable, meaning that it expects to find the black wire connected to both sides of the existing switch. As I said, I had one black wire that was already bridged to the switch above it and connected to one terminal of the existing switch. I decided to connect the black wire from the existing switch to the black wire of the Wemo, and the red wire from the existing switch to the other black wire on the Wemo. The white wire from the Wemo went to the common bundle in the existing outlet box. I didn't have a ground connection, so I simply capped and taped that wire. Bingo! Everything worked fine and the switch operated as expected and connected easily to my wireless. I'm not sure why Belkin doesn't include variant wiring instructions, but from my experience, if the switch where you're installing the Wemo has one red, one black and a common bundle (white), you'll be just fine. My only real complaint is that this switch is only available in white. Our existing switches are beige, so this one stands out. Since it's in my office, it's not critical, but if I was looking to replace a switch in a highly decorated room, it would bother me much more.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Great product for giving ""Alexa"" commands to most any electrical device with a plug. No separate hub required.",5.0 ,"Home automation will only work when it's easy to set up. And the Wemo Mini Smart Plug was pretty easy to set up for use with Alexa commands. The instructions are straight forward. Although they don't tell you exactly how to make the plug wok with Echo, the process is intuitive: simply add it as a device in the Alexa app. After a satisfactory experience with the first device, I bought another. I can now say, ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamp"", or, Alexa, turn on the family room lamp,"" and she and the Wemo fulfill my wish. My first attempt at home automation was with the TP-Link device, which is listed as an ""Amazon Choice"". Well, it didn't work for me. I could never get my wi-fi to recognize the unit, even after two calls to tech support. My advice? Forget the TP-Link plug and go with the Wemo because it's a snap to set up. (Note: I've had my first Wemo for only a couple of weeks and may re-visit this review if I have problems.) I first tried the TP-Link product, but never could get it to work so I returned it","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"UPDATE - Nice device, the app didn't work. However I now have an untested update to the app.",2.0 ,"UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: Discovered today, 10/11/2016, that there was an update to the WeMo app. I downloaded the app which proptly informed me that the app would not work with my version of android. However, it provided a link and instructions on how to download (I expect) an earlier version that would work with my version of android. The info also specified that they would no longer be supporting Android 4.3 or below. The instructions also specified that I should not open the app until I was connected to the network the wemo switches are on. As this is at our vacation home, it will be a few weeks before I can test it. I would like to point out that I discovered this on my own. I did not receive an email telling me about it (which would have been nice). However, since an update to the app did occur, Ive raised the star count to 2. Once I get a chance to check the app, I'll post another update. ********* Original review: The switch itself arrived quickly and was easy to install and set up. However, the manufacturers app (CONTRARY TO WHAT IS ADVERTISED) currently only works with android 4.4 or higher. Since I have a phone running Android 4.3, I can't utilize the app except to setup the switches (i.e. connect the switches to my router). Wemo tech support provided the following help: ""We currently have a known problem with our latest App being unable to detect the Wemo devices if you are using a device that runs on Android 4.3 version. Our engineering team is still looking into this problem. The only work around for this is to use a device that has Android 4.4 or higher, or an iOS device."" Effectively, I spent $50 apiece for a toggle switch that I could have purchased for $2 and lost 3 hours trying to get the darn app to work as advertised. If Belkin/Wemo fixes the issue, I will update. Until then, don't believe the advertising and, if planning to use an android ran device, verify that the version is 4.4 (heck, I'd make it android 5.0 or higher) or look to a different manufacturer.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Makes for a warm and happy lizard,5.0 ,I bought this switch to remotely control a light for my reptile and also to keep the light on a set schedule that I could modify with the seasons and it has worked perfectly for this. I had no issues following the instructions and getting it connected to my Wireless-N network. I don't use the energy consumption feature of the switch but prefer the Insight model due to the smaller size. The phone app has been intuitive in setting up the schedule and I haven't experienced freezes or crashes so that's a plus. I also integrate the switch with IFTTT to send me notifications whenever the switch is on/off and it has also worked as expected. I would be willing to purchase more of these whenever I go further down the home automation road.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
I love this! I've owned 2 other WeMo Insight Switches ...,5.0 ,"I love this! I've owned 2 other WeMo Insight Switches which have helped me with automating my house lights, as well as curve energy costs for my gaming PC. However both of those had a glaring issue: They were BLEEEEEPING huge! This switch solves that issue. I'm going to get more of these as soon as I have need for them. (I'm most likely moving shortly so I'll be able to automate my whole house with them) Thanks to the IFTTT integration, these switches work great with the Google Home. Although for some reason, I've had one or two experiences where the lights did not shut off after declaring they would through the Google Home; but that can be said about any new type of gadget. There will be bugs to fix. Over all I'm happy with my purchase, but I will say that one somewhat ""Negative"" is the app that WeMo provides for your phone. The UI is horribly outdated (IE the app looks like it was designed for the original ""Samsung Galaxy 1"" phone) and it is somewhat difficult to setup, but the instructions that come with the WeMo Mini are basically for phones that are 3+ years old. I have a Nexus 6p, and I'm a nerd / coder; if I'm having to guess during the install process, you need to change your setup manual :(","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Great device for on-demand or scheduled control,5.0 ,"I bought one of these on sale so I could reboot something remotely if it died while I was away, but I started by trying it out on a lamp to see how it worked. I liked the way it controlled the lamp so much that I bought two more, one for another lamp and one for my original remote reboot application. They're super simple to install and connect to your WiFi network and feature-rich. You can toggle them on-demand with the app, or use the app to set up a schedule. The best part is that you don't have to invest in a hub to connect these. Essentially the app becomes your hub. They also control any device that plugs into an outlet, from LED lamps to air conditioners. I guess one of the differences between this and the older WeMo switch is the power monitoring capability of this model. Very useful to check the power consumption of your devices and see real time status. However, you'll need to calibrate the switch to the power use of the device you're controlling. Originally my LED bulbs did not consume enough power to show as on in the app, which appears to set the threshold at 8W. WeMo makes calibration easy by providing a button in the app that lets the switch detect on and off state power usage and set its own threshold, which for the LEDs turned out to be 2W. I seriously love these things. The only thing that could make them better is to include a dimmer function at some point.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Updates fail every time, but switch and power monitoring work well.",4.0 ,"This switch with power monitoring works well. As a remote switch, it works great. The large manual button is good when needed, so you don't need to pull up the app. The app provides good power monitoring information, easily allowing you to see the post usage of your devices. Very good. What's not so good? 1. The App always shows the correct switch state of On or Off (that's a good thing), but the Android Widgets get out of sync with the switch state. The Widgets will update correctly when you launch the app, but it would be nice if that wasn't needed. The Widgets allow fast controls without going to an app, so they're very useful. Just cannot trust what they say. That's for Android, I don't know if iPhone had something similar or not. Minor issue. 2. When I launched the wemo app, it tells me there is an update available for my Wemo insight, and gives me the option to install it. Updates are great, a way to address security issues, improve functionality - awesome. My Wemo mini switch updated perfectly. Sadly, my Insight had filled every time I've told it to install the update. It is now on 7 Fails. :-(","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Unreliable... without assigning it's MAC address to a static IP,3.0 ,"The light switch will disconnect from my network any time I attempt to connect to it via my phone. I was able to run though the initial setup, but have since been unable to change any settings of the sort or toggle the switch remotely using the app without it disconnecting from the network. This has been very disappointing, and will preclude me from buying any more Belkin WeMo products unless they drastically improve the reliability of their hardware/software. Belkin needs to publish better troubleshooting guides for this product. I found the guides online to be way oversimplified. Would like to see firmware version release notes posted on the Belkin website. Edit 4/21/15 - I assigned a static IP in my router config to the switch's MAC address. I figured this out within a day or two of writing my previous review, giving the device some time to prove itself. I have seen a consistent connection to the network ever since. I was troubleshooting and noticed a remarkably high number of DHCP requests in my router log files being generated from the Belkin Switch. It was an abnormally high number, basically spamming my 2.4GHz network with requests, actually impeding my normal wireless traffic. I was getting about 0.7Mb/s down on my 2.4GHz band, and over 30Mb/s on my 5.0Ghz band... something was up. I figured by assigning it a static IP it wouldn't need to send as many requests, and if it still did the router had a lot less work to do on it's end. As it turns out, assigning it the static IP allowed my 2.4GHz band to resume to normal bandwidth (around ~30mB/s) and the light switch has not disconnected since. I'm revising my review to 3 stars. The product now works, however one note is that I'm an Electrical Engineer working in the tech industry with over 8 years of experience. How in the word a normal user would figure out how to assign it a static IP? It's a pretty safe bet they wouldn't and they'd be looking at a fancy push button switch that glows green when turned ""ON"". I give it 3 stars because the product was shipped with obvious Firmware Bugs that could have been caught with some basic validation of customer use cases.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Great for the next phase of your smart home.,4.0 ,Purchased these dimmers for all of our bedrooms. I was surprised and pleased by how responsive the touch dimming capability is. They are a lot easier to install and pair that some other smart switches. I tried the Castela but to be honest I wasn't all that impressed. They are pain to pair up even with the hub. I opted to give the Wemo dimmers a try and so far I'm happy with the switch. First off the design is nice and modern if that's the look your going for. The dimmer operates by touch which some people my hate but that's all up to the user. Pairing was simple enough using the app and then linking it to my Samsung Smartthings and my google home. The stand alone app itself is just ok. I find that sometimes it doesn't always see all my switches or takes a long time to connect to it. Otherwise accessing via google home or even Alexa has been pretty good. They aren't cheap but they're also far from the most expensive out there. For the value I would highly recommend taking a look.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Absolutely fabulous.. For when it works!,2.0 ,"I really liked these switches. I purchased 2 and one month after that also 4 light switches that are yet to be installed. I was really impressed with the ease of setup and the wow factor these devices give you. Nothing beats getting home after work and telling alexa: please turn on my fan, turn on my tv. As a added benefit your tv (and everything else connected to the switch) won't consume any energy if you're not using it. The switch will though but still.. Some devices really suck up alot of energy even when not using them (read sony ps4!) A couple of days ago, within 2 months of purchase one of these switches fails to connect the network. I've tried countless solutions (there are a lot of threads about this on belkins website), but nothing seems to work. 2 months is just way too fast for a device like this to fail! Also if you search for refurbished ones, there are a ton on amazon and ebay! Definitely not a good sign! I should've done my research before buying these. I read about the negative reviews thinking it wouldn't happen to me.. In the end, this was just a waste of cash!! Buyers beware!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Two Stars Off for Astonishingly Terrible Customer Service,2.0 ,"I purchased one of these units a couple of months ago and was extremely pleased with the results. With a successful trial run under my belt, I purchased another switch a month later. From there, things went downhill fast. I installed the switch near my front door, and after powering the breaker back on, the switch refused to connect to my wi-fi network. Trial and error led me to the conclusion that 802.11G on my dual band router was not strong enough at this location. In pursuit of further trial and error, I moved the switch into the same box as the first switch I already had working successfully. Even though the existing switch continued to perform flawlessly, the new switch again complained about wi-fi connectivity. It was at this point I concluded the unit was defective. My first call to Belkin customer service lasted 45 minutes. They obviously outsource their call center, so the language barrier was occasionally a problem, but after much back and forth, they agreed to send me a new unit, while temporarily charging my credit card for the defective switch until they received the return. Not ideal, but it is what it is. Several days later, a 4 foot by 4 foot by 2 inch box arrived on my doorstep. It said ""Belkin Wemo"" on the labels, but obviously not what I was expecting. Riveted by curiosity, I opened the box to find that Belkin had sent me a cardboard advertisement for the Wemo Switch that you might find in your local Best Buy. Nowhere in the box was the actual switch. The next two calls to Belkin were 30 minutes each. The first ended just before I was ready to pull my hair out of my head from retracing the same territory over and over again with an operator incapable of solving my problem. On the second call I spoke with a supervisor who eventually asked me to have my wife go in the backyard and take a picture of the cardboard box to email to her. She then finally agreed to expedite the delivery of the actual switch. This will supposedly arrive within 48 hours. After my experience with the first switch, I was looking forward to adopting the Belkin Wemo standard for much of my home. The app works well, the connectivity is satisfyingly snappy, and the units are attractive when installed. After my experience with their customer service, I can't imagine committing to this standard. It's a real shame to see a company produce a compelling technology and then fail so utterly in supporting their product that it makes the product lesser by association. Sadly, my search a replacement to the X10 standard must go on. Goodbye Belkin. UPDATE: In a comical, yet astounding feat of incompetence, Belkin once-again failed to send me a replacement switch. They sent ANOTHER cardboard sign! I was dreading a followup call, which was quite justified. 30 more minutes of wasted time was all I could bare. Customer service seems almost professionally incompetent, and oddly unable to relate to a strange problem with any sort of rational motivation. I eventually confirmed card would not be charged for the product I never received and I hung up. I will attempt, as I should have in the first place, to return through Amazon. If not, I'm gonna write this off as $37 dollars and way-too-much-time-wasted. Truly, Belkin is a company at odds. Their products could be great, but their support is impossibly terrible.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Bad software, unreliable away from home sometimes",3.0 ,I've been using these switches for about 2 weeks now. First of all as others have mentioned make sure you have a neutral wire in your junction box. My light switches were not hooked up to a neutral wire but there was a neutral wire in the box I was able to tap into. The primary reason I chose the wemo switch over the neo smart switches is because of the sunset sunrise option. I needed a switch to turn my outside lights on at dark. It has been very reliable at doing this every night they turn on about 20 minutes before it's completely dark which it's about prefect for me. The software leaves a little to be desired. setting up rules is pretty straight forward but I think it should be a little more intuitive. The software is a little clunky and ugly. Turning the lights on and off away from your home network doesn't always work. It will tell me that it can't find my switches sometimes. All in all aside from the clunky app and unreliable control away from home I still like the switches. they look really nice in the wall and the green light catches eyes.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
The switch I should have bought the first time!,4.0 ,"Received it today and installed in about 5 minutes. Set up in about 1 minute and it's working with Alexa. I bought it specifically to work with Alexa and I will be buying more to set up in my grandparents' house so they can have an easier life. So far initial impressions are super easy idiot proof install and it works great! My only reason for four stars is the smart switch that this replaced had a definite ""click"" sound when you manually press the switch. I liked that for the reason that you knew it was pressed and if it did not work, you would know that it was not. Only time will tell if this stays connected to the network and works reliably... so far I am impressed and will probably be buying more.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
expect a learning curve,4.0 ,"Ok, Ive had these (3 of them) in my home for about 2 weeks now. There is a learning curve that comes with them. I use them with my echo. installation is simple once you view the youtube video. It did take a day or two for them to quite disconnecting from the internet and After reading several reviews. no thanks to the non existing directions I realized I kept hitting the reset button on the switch plate.. Soooo just a word of advise that little green button/light is NOT the on off button it is the reset button. tap the middle of the plate if you want to manual turn on and off the light. Once I stopped pressing it all is well and Ive actually begun really enjoying these fun little switches. Especially when you are already comfy in bed and all you have to do is ask alexa to turn off your lights!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
So far...it's working!,4.0 ,"I received the Wemo Mini Smart Plug today and set it up right away. The only issue I had was for some reason even though it appeared that WiFi WAS connected (said ""connected"" with the name of my WiFi) on my device in the WEMO app, it kept loading and indicating that it could not locate the WiFi connection. It ""asked"" me to put in my password again, which I had to do three times. On the third attempt, even though the app still indicated that it did not connect, boom, it suddenly connected! It was a little bit of a hassle, but all-in-all, it only took about 10 minutes to connect the WEMO Mini Smart Plug to the WiFi. The other situation appears to be ""user"" used to turning the light off via the switch, so when I turn it back on, I have to manually hit the WEMO plug switch again. ""User"" needs to retrain this ""habit."" Set up of various on/off times was relatively simple. If this smart plug works as it should, then I will be content.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Decent product but suffers from design quirks,2.0 ,"Five stars for the function. Functions as expected. Three stars removed due to some really poor utility features I didn't see until I had to move my router. After the router came back on, this wall switch and the WeMo Switch plugged into an outlet failed to reconnect. (iHome, GE and Leviton devices all came back happy.) I had to reset the Switch and reconnect it via setup but when I went to reset the Wall Switch and ""Restart"" failed, the following reset instructions made me reconsider my intent to add more WeMo devices in the future: : QUICK TIP: If the WEMO Light Switch is not responding to the Restart button, turn OFF the power of the WEMO Light Switch by turning the circuit breaker OFF and then turning back ON. Step 2: Immediately press and hold the Reset button for five (5) seconds. The WEMO Light Switch Wi-Fi icon will blink amber rapidly, indicating a successful restore. ""Turn on circuit breaker and IMMEDIATELY press and hold the Reset button""? If I wore a red suit with a lightning bolt on the chest or had conveniently mounted my light switch on the outside wall next to the circuit panel, this method would make sense. Having the switch mounted in the wall near the light it operates makes this step somewhat problematic for a lone user. If I didn't have a wife handy, I suppose I could remove the front plate, remove the switch from the wall and disconnect the power lead to cut power (I can hear the shrieks at the OSHA office from here). Even then, twisting the wire nut back on to a live wire while IMMEDIATELY pressing and holding the reset button seems like it would require more than the two hands I was born with. This sort of designer/user disconnect is all too common in tech products since designers often aren't tasked with installation. Oh, well...","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Works great for what I need it to do.,4.0 ,"Light switch was fairly straightforward to install and setup. Fits nicely with the newer d√©cor switches and installed without a problem in a 3 gang switch box. The only issue I had was the first one I received must have been defective out of the box. I should have realized that there was a problem with the switch, because after I switched the breaker back on, the light the switch was supposed to be controller was already flickering even though I had not manually turned the switch on. Tried to set that one up, but after about an hour it was a no go. Requested a replacement from Amazon, and setup took about an hour, including creating rules on ifttt website. It has only been installed for three days, but so far, so good. Update: We have been using WeMo for a little over two years now. The wall switches and smart switches work without issue and we never have problems turning them on or with rules not being followed. The only issue we have run into is with the WeMo application on Android. If we are connected to our home WiFi, the Insight Switch has problems being recognized as on or off. On cellular data service, the issue does not occur. This does not happen with the iOS version of the application. All in all, still very happy with these devices, especially with the Amazon Echo integration.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Worked great, and as advertised...with reservations",5.0 ,"This is an upgraded review based upon the untiring, dogged support of Renette Reazon, a Belkin support technician who has worked with me off & on over the last few months. Together we ironed out problems unknown to them. Earlier, I stated that this product is not ready for a public roll-out, and I stand by that, conditionally. My Samsung S5 running Android 4.2.2 could not connect to my devices remotely. As it turned out, my wife's phone, tablet, and my phone over-extended the maximum number of devices (3) allowed to control a single account. Renette fixed that on Belkin's side and now I have full control over 3G/4G/LTE again. My conditional 5-star review is based on WeMo's release to all devices, iOS's & android's, with full testing on all models prior to release. If you are following me so far, you may realize they are faced with a near-impossible task. I had a long career installing industrial sensors that worked flawlessly out of the box. I expected the same performance from this consumer line of products and learned there are so many variables to successful implementation that neither me nor Belkin had encountered them all. For now, I am content. I now know that WiFi must be turned off when away from a WiFi source. Connecting to 3G/4G/LTE needs to be accomplished with my phone's WiFi turned off. Strange but true. Not a problem now that I know that limitation. Perhaps they'll someday figure out that quirk. BTW, ""3G"" is a programmer's text string letting you know you are connecting over your phone's network. They could have presented you with ""Phone Network"", ""Not WiFi"", or any other choice of verbiage. Be assured you are connecting over your phone's fastest network (and using data gigabytes).

A Perfect Fix,5.0 ,"The item arrived on-time and damage free. I love this product. My new home did not come with a light sensor on the seven front soffit lights. I accidentally left them on all-day a couple of times (Luckily the lights are high efficiency LED lamps). I have the experience to wire homes, but did not want to mess with running new wires through insulated walls in the middle of winter. So, with a little shopping around, I found this home-automation switch requiring no wiring changes. (OK, I am a retired engineer and like automation). This product was not expensive and it replaced the switch for my front lights and automatically turns lights on and off via my local time zone with daylight programming options. The program can be overridden with the toggle switch. The programming took all of 2-minutes to setup. I programmed the switch on my PC or Phone once and never had to worry about leaving my lights on. My wife thought it was a silly way to fix my situation and now loves it too!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Works great, but watch for sales as they are expensive",5.0 ,"Loving these light switches. We've been slow to incorporate connected devices beyond computer / tablet type items. We went this route to program our exterior lights on the porch and garage instead of replacing our current lights. While we could have picked up garage lights with dusk/dawn sensors, they were much more expensive than replacing the switch that controlled them. Our porch lights are recessed and the dusk/dawn option just isn't available. These light switches solved those problems and were a breeze to install. Our boxes are a bit crowded, but we were able to safely tuck all the wires back into the box mainly to the side of these rather deep WeMo switches.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"WeMo Light Switch, Wi-Fi enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa",5.0 ,"I really like the WeMo smart switch. I use it via Alexa by giving voice commands to turn on various lights and lamps throughout the house. They say that you cannot use it with 3--way switches. That is true if you talk about physical wiring. But you can/ I did wire around one of the 3-way switches and placed the smart switch in one of the locations and it works just fine from voice commands or manual control from your smart phone or by manually pressing the switch if your Wi-Fi is out for some reason. You have to give each switch a name at setup. Sometime Alexa misinterprets the name when you speak and you have to repeat the command like ""Turn the lamp on or off."" Once a switch became disassociated with the Wi-Fi and there is a very discrete bar on the bottom of the switch. If yo press and hold it for about 5 seconds, my switch reconnected to Wi-Fi and all was well. I have trouble walking so these are great for me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Early adopter, current user",5.0 ,"When I first read about these on TC, I figured these would fit into my plans for home automation. I'm always an early adopter of new cool things like this. Initially the setup was painful. It took me forever to try and get it wired following the instructions with nothing working. Frustrated enough to research the email address of the CEO and email him directly for product feedback. He emailed me a couple of hours later and said he wants to get it write and had an engineer reach out to me about the problems. A firmware update later on resolved the problem I was having. Flash forward and somewhere along the way I was no longer using the app to control this or my WeMo outlet switches. Well, getting the light switch and the outlet switches all set up again, I went through a couple of firmware updates and the product is a lot more solid. I have all of the devices dialed in and on timers using the app. Super happy for not throwing in the towel. Pros - Simple instructions + patience will make this easy to set up. - Integrrates with IFTT. - App can set timers for going on and off. Works great for when you're away from home. - Good look and touch response. Cons - If you have short patience, this isn't for you. - App needs updating. Seems a bit clunky and not updated for newer iOS screen sizes. Areas to improve - Update design of the app to seem less clunky. - Notifications would be nice. Like if someone turned the light on manually. - Reset buttons should be easier to discern from looking at them. - More color options? Black would be nice.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
$15 Coffee maker just got smarter on a budget!,5.0 ,"I'm in love. Belkin WeMo Mini‚Äôs form factor, price, and set of smart-home features set it apart from the competition. I have to admit I haven't used a ton of smart plug brands but luckily I don't have to. The WeMo Mini supports IFTTT (‚Äúif this then that‚Äù), I didn't know this until after I got it *Disclaimer, if you're not a tech head don't ever bother with IFTTT. The switch works with the Amazon Alexa and Google Home (I use an Amazon Echo and echo dot in my home) which allows you to turn on a lamp, fan, or any other electronic device with voice. It's a very fun products that let's you bring old devices to life, my best example is a $15 coffee maker I wasn't using anymore. I leave everything ready at night (water and grounds), in the morning I just ask Alexa to ""turn on coffee maker"" and voil√†. *recently added another Mini Smart plug to a LED strip I bought for cheap on Amazon.

"A MUST HAVE, IF YOU HAVE ALEXA!!!!",5.0 ,"I purchased this to sync with my Amazon Dot. The setup right out of the box was very easy, download the WEMO app, connect to Wi-Fi, and then go into the Alexa app to sync it. They work very well together. The WEMO app also allows you to turn on and off the device from your mobile phone or tablet. I use mine exclusively with Alexa and haven't had any issues. If you have more than one plug you can rename them to make it simple. I renamed mine to Lamp and Bedroom Lamp. The plug is small enough that the second wall plug can be used by another device. The device itself is the perfect size considering and very sturdy material. I love being able to walk into my great room and say 'Alexa' 'Turn on the lamp' and just like that the lamp is on. I'm thinking about getting one more for the lights over my kitchen cabinets. I highly recommend the plug, especially if you have Alexa. (FYI - You don't need anything additional to make it work with Alexa, just download the WEMO App and connect it to the Alexa App).","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Great device with a couple of minor quibbles,4.0 ,"I'm very pleased with the plug aside from two issues: 1. It doesn't run on 5GHz networks. 2. Wifi authentication doesn't support captive portals. The first is no big deal; most people have dual-band routers. The second is a bit more annoying. I can't use this at work, for example, without getting IT to do a bunch of work. Additionally, setup was a bit tricky since it didn't immediately recognize my wifi but it did eventually get there. Not a big deal at all. Integration with IFTTT is great, and I like that I can use third-party tools like ouimeaux to work with this. Very recommended!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
A good first step for the IoT - with a few quirks,4.0 ,"I bought the WeMo lightswitch as an experiment in home automation. I wanted to add timer control to my living room lights, and the price isn't much higher than a good timer switch. I've had the switch in place for a few weeks now, and these are my impressions. Installation was simple, but be aware that if you have an older home (50s) the wall box might be a tight fit. The WeMo fills most of the box, leaving little room for the existing wiring. Setup was a little frustrating due to a firmware update the switch wanted to do during setup. It ended up forcing me to do a factory reset to get a connection going again. Once I got past that, it seemed to be smooth sailing. The indicator lights for WiFi, power, etc are hard to see in normal room light. Once I started using the switch with the WeMo app, it is a breeze to use. the app is logical and friendly. However, I encountered a bug in the controls that caused me lots of frustration and days of calls and interaction with WeMo support. I set the lights to come on at sunset and off at 11:05 PM. This worked fine, but then the lights would turn back on at midnight for no reason. After lots of calls and emails, resets, etc., their tech suggested I stop using the sunset setting and use a time instead. This fixed the problem of the light coming on at midnight. UPDATE: new firmware released May '15 that corrects this issue. I really like this switch and am looking around the house for the next switches to automate.. The WeMo app works perfectly to connect with the switch. No dimming though. That would be cool. I also experimented with the IFTTT app, that integrates WeMo notifications and it works great. I set IFTTT to text me when the lights come on, and it works.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Buggy set up and update - but I like them,4.0 ,"I like these - I'm slowly building a set of smart home devices, and I got these to allow Alexa to control my lamps. The set up seems straightforward, but is really buggy. The WeMo app crashed the first time I tried to open it, sending me in a spiral of resets. Then, everything seemed to be fine, but one switch suddenly became inaccessible over wifi - but over cellular, I could control it. I tracked this down to being due to only one switch getting updated during the firmware update. Unfortunately, the WeMo app can't handle updating just one switch when another on the system is up to date, so you have to unplug the up to date switches. Of course, after that, the unplugged switches were undiscoverable. After resetting and reinstalling several times, I think we're in good shape. But what the heck? I can't imagine why the process is so complicated... Assuming I won't have to do that again any time soon, I do like these, and they work nicely with Alexa.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
A great plug that could be made better,4.0 ,"Overall it is a good product and I would recommend it. I originally bought it hoping to eliminate the use of a power strip as this plug has a narrower profile than the TP-link plug it replaced and doesn't cover both outlets. Even though it didn't accomplish the goal (due to the other item plugged into the outlet, which is no fault of the device), it is an attractive well designed switch that has more capabilities that the switch it replaced. The Pros are: 1. Narrow profile that doesn't cover the second plug in the outlet. 2. Easy setup (Wemo outlets have a kind of unique setup where you have to select the outlet first in the wifi settings section of your phone before you can complete your install. However, as long as you follow the directions it seems pretty easy.) 3. Easy integration with IFTTT, Samsung Smartthings and Alexa. The Cons are: 1. Doesn't work with Apple Homekit. 2. It seems to loose its device settings if the power is turned off for an extended period of time, which means that you then have to resetup the outlet again. Ordinarily I would give it a five star, but for the lack of Homekit connectivity and the fact that it drops off the network if it looses power for a while I felt that I had to knock off a star. However, that being said, its probably one of the best smartplugs on the market right now.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Don't forget to turn out the lights!,5.0 ,"Well, so far, so good. I have been skeptical about trying this kind of product because there are just so many out there and so many brands that it was difficult to narrow down. I mainly bought this one because it only blocks one outlet and you don't need an additional hub or controller device to go with it. Just plug it in the wall, plug in your lamp/fan/whatever and go. The app is free and straightforward to use and so far we have no issues with it working. My only disappointment, and it is not with the product exactly, is that it would be much more useful to have a wi-fi lightbulb or light switch (although the switch would not be plug and go) as it is hard to find a single lamp that I need to turn on when out of the room or not at home. I can see this being useful in an apartment maybe but in a house, it just doesn't do enough to make me excited. I wish there were high watt bulbs out there that could standalone (sans hub) and then you could put them in more meaningful places. Overall, no complaints, product works reliably as advertised at a not too expensive cost. Works with Alexa and other such devices. Does not monitor energy usage. Unlike many other reviewers, we had no issue with setup, done in a few minutes and has been working fine for months.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Not yet ready for prime time,2.0 ,"This review is for the WeMo light switch, the one that hard wires in to replace a conventional light switch. Because of it's unreliable operation I can only give it two stars, and that is being generous. At least once a day the switch fails to operate. Judging from the built in LEDs , this is because it is having difficulty communicating with both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home devices. When this happens the switch WILL NO LONGER WORK MANUALLY either. After a minute or so the device resets itself and returns to normal operation. In my humble opinion, the WeMo light switch is not ready for prime time. On the other hand I also have several WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa , the ones that you plug into a standard 110v outlet and then plug whatever you want to control into the WeMo switch. I have had no problem at all with those, and happily give those WeMo devices 5 stars even though they don't yet work with Google Home.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
It's a hassle and not worth it,2.0 ,"Even after reading a lot of negative reviews, I still went ahead and ordered this to give it a try. It has been nothing but a pain. One it comes with no directions other what printed on the cardboard wrapping around the box. And those directions make it sound simple and hassle free. That has been far from it. It took me hours to get it to connect. Once it did it lasted a day before becoming disconnected, and where I have placed it for the floor lamp is not easily reached. It also says you can control it from anywhere. I have not found that to be true. Then again, no directions so I might just not know how, but as soon as you leave your house, it's no longer connected to the Wi-Fi so how is that possible. Alexa has found the device, but I have not been able to control it through her. Long story short, It's not worth the hassle, and I am sending it back. I did order the tp link smart plug instead. I heard better things about that one. I sure hope so.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Wizardry,5.0 ,"So far - so great. WeMo+Amazon Echo=Awesome. I feel like a home automation wizard - without any of the wizardry skills. Be sure to take a look at where you plan to install this to make sure you have a neutral wire. If so, your set and after finding the right breaker to shut off - this takes about 5 minutes to get into the wall. It did take me a few tries to get this connected to my Wifi. I had good signal, and the switch found my SSID, but after entering my password it was unable to successfully connect. I was able to connect on the first try after I rebooted my router. I'm not certain why - and only time will tell how stable the connection is, but for the past week things have been working great. After connecting to wifi, I was prompted for a firmware update - which was successful, and immediately following that I was prompted for another update. It appears as though you have to step through the firmware versions one at a time. Could be a pain if you get an old switch and a ton of firmware versions need to be applied. My first attempt was with the porch lights. I configured a Sunrise to Sunset timer which works flawlessly. Able to control the lights with my iPhone, but the real kicker is being able to tell Alexa to turn on or off the lights. That little feature had be back ordering a few more WeMo devices to control things where that will be more useful. In the next few months I may gain a few LBs as I no longer have to get off of my couch or even pick up my phone to turn on the fan while I'm watching TV.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Easy To Install WeMo Switch,4.0 ,"I've had a couple WeMo plugs for awhile and have been impressed for the most part of how they work. So, as I've started to get into the smart home concept, I thought I would try a WeMo light switch in my kitchen. Installation is crazy simple. It comes with a guide and there are tons of videos online that show you exactly what you need to do. The wires are also labeled on the back of the switch and color coded, so it is pretty hard to hook this up wrong. Overall it took me 15 minutes to get it installed, but I've got experience changing outlets and plugs. Once it was in, I connected to it through WiFi and opened the WeMo app. It added it to my list of devices and then I was able to quickly setup a rule on the switch so when I long press it, all my other kitchen lights (under the counter) also come on. I've also got an Echo Dot, so I'm able to control it with voice as well. Overall this is a nice addition, just a little more work than their plugs. I'll update this review if I have any issues with it.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Works, but has a fatal flaw.",4.0 ,"The Wemo Mini Smart Plug works well most of the time, but has a fatal flaw. As long as there is continuous power, the Wemo has worked well, even though it indicates marginal wi-fi reception at a distance of about 43 feet from my router. In this condition, it has never missed a beat. After a power failure, however, the Wemo and my router cannot find each other, and the Wemo remains totally unresponsive. To get it back, I have to go through the setup process again, which is a real nuisance. Where I live, power outages are a common occurrence, and we've probably had for or five in the month that I've owned the Wemo. In addition, the Wemo is located behind a cabinet, so resetting it requires moving furniture and crawling around on hands and knees -- not fun. Of note too, upon power restoration, the Wemo comes back in the Off condition, which is perfectly acceptable for my purposess, but may be a problem for some.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Install was easy. Setting up was also pretty easy,3.0 ,"Got this specifically for our front door light. Works perfectly. Set up was fairly easy. Can set it to turn on and off at sunrise/sunset. App is pretty simple to use and if you have a Nest tstat, you can connect to it and change your temp through app if you wanted to. The switch itself is a push button and not a rocker switch as it looks. Only issue is the mounting plate is thicker plastic so if you have a multi switch pannel, you need a wall plate thick or deep enough to accommodate it or the wall plate won't sit flush (see in pic). I tried the Tp-Link kasa switch and it was more of a pain to set up. They both seem to be made by the same manucature because they are almost identical. The TP-Links app however seems to offer a bit more in features. Not a deal breaker for me. I returned the TP-Link. Connecting to wifi was not the same as with WeMo and was more frustrating to me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Setup was unnecessarily cumbersome,2.0 ,"I bought this and a Kasa device to see which I want to adopt for my overall hone. So far, Kasa has a slight lead. I finally got Wemo to work after twice giving up on connecting the device but then later trying it again. One word of advice, be double sure when entering your home wireless password because you only get one chance to get it right. If you enter it incorrectly, you must uninstall the app and download it again. There were other issues installing as well that I won't mention. But I will say that the instructions almost taunt you by bragging how easy it is to setup. It's not easy. Kasa devices are much easier than Wemo. Once instslled, using the app isn't any easier. I found it confusing to setup a schedule. I finally got it to work, but wasn't sure how I did it so I tried it again and still wasn't sure how I did it. Oh well. Tomorrow if I have lots of time I may try to connect it to Akexa.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Good but network security flaws,4.0 ,"Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of the Belkin Wemo light switches and the plug in ones for lamps, etc. But Belkin has not exactly made them fail safe from network issues. If you sell or give your switch away your network will not be completely erased from the device. Surprise, the next person to install the switch may still be able see your other Belkin devices and vice versa. Or if you leave the light switches and move with your router to a new home, you still might be able to control the switches left in your old home, just for laughs. Turn the lights on and off a 3AM. You cannot have a switch at home and one at work. Only one network allowed. I would never buy a used Wemo switch from Ebay. You are asking for trouble. Belkin is probably not alone in this issue with all the wifi devices that are floating around now. They are useful for many things. Amazon ECHO control is a bonus too.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Got two of these so I could program them while ...,4.0 ,"Got two of these so I could program them while away. The programming DON'T WORK! Just last night, I programmed them to turn off after 2 hours on. This morning, they are still on. So if you are looking for away mode or any other programming, look elsewhere. I must edit this review. Between the time I wrote it and now, I have been able to get a programing workaround. By setting a scheduled time for the Wemo to start and then a duration for the light to stay on, and setting a separate on time and duration for each Wemo, I now have a functioning program for each. Will continue to play, but within reason I can get the Wemos to do what I want. I will not give them five stars, because of complexity of setup, but I will award 4 stars. Note: I am a retired programmer/analyst, but it shouldn't need someone similar to me to get these things working. Still have not gotten the away mode to work, but I am still trying.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Works well, but setup is a pain",4.0 ,"I own a few of these Wemo Minis and one Wemo Insight. I've‚Äã used both the iOS and Android apps for to setup the devices and my experience with both has been largely the same. The app initially locates the new Wemo but then spends a lot of time connecting and then failing. Eventually it connects, updates the firmware, and then works pretty much flawlessly. (my Insight pooped the bed once and required a full reset.). All in all I'm very happy with the product and will buy more. I use an Amazon Echo and multiple Echo Dots to control them throughout my home.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Sliced bread is so yesterday!,5.0 ,"Finally! ""Alexa turn on/off the lights!"" I mean what else is there to say? It is so awesome to be able to control the lights with your voice or through the wemo app. Kids leave the light on? No problem. Alexa or the app have it covered. Coming home late and want the lights on? No problem. Turn them on while still in your car with the app. Going away and want to make it look like someone is home? No problem! Program a schedule. The switch is very easy to install with even the most basic skills and tools. However it does require both hot and neutral so be sure to check for both black and white wires behind the switch you want to replace. Unfortunately it also only handles single switch circuits so if you can turn on/off your light from multiple switches this will not work. This switch is very deep so make sure you have room in the box you are installing it into.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Thank you WEMO,5.0 ,"I have been transformed into a wemo guy. First, I bought the switch, then soon fell in love with that. Then I got an Amazon echo, and was soon so entertained with turning my light on and off with my voice. After that, I bought the energy monitoring plug. Then, two Wemo mini. I have not once had any problem setting any of them up. It only takes a minute. Literally. I have found these to become useful in my life, and helpful to turn on with your voice. (Amazon Echo) I am overall very pleased with Wemo. I would buy more in the future but I don't think I have anything left to plug in!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Allow A Demo Mode for the App!!!!,5.0 ,"WeMo Light Switch. I have only had this for a few days now but no connectivity issues, even after firmware update. I did however run into an issue while trying to perform the update and could not do it on my Note 5. I ended up doing the update on my iPad and it worked just fine. We love the features of the app. I can program it to turn on, only after dusk, before I arrive home. This way the lights don't turn on when I get home in the middle of the day. Its great that it integrates with the Nest Home/Away feature using the location of your phone. BTW, it fits in a standard gang plate like the ones found in the big box home improvement stores. So if you are replacing a similar style switch in a gang box, don't worry, it will fit. Just make sure the cover is not pressing on the tiny buttons at the bottom. Integration with Alexa is seemless, although not all functions are available using her. I bought this one to replace another (similar, very popular brand on Amazon) wifi switch that was severely lacking in the app department. One suggestion to Belkin though is to allow a demo mode with the app. I had to look through several YouTube videos and scrounge the interwebs to figure out what functions the app has. Not cool. No stars deducted for that though. I will update my review if I have any issues. Otherwise its staying at 5 stars.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
These devices work great!,5.0 ,"I've got several of the older/larger style and this is the first Mini Smart Plug that I've bought. Here's what they are doing around my house: -Replacing mechanical lamp timers. They've been very reliable and I set them up with the app to automatically adjust to the local sunrise/sunset. E.g. always come on at 1/2 hour before sunset, turn off at midnight, turn on at 6 AM, and turn off again at 1/2 hour after sunrise -I'm an electronics hobbyist and run a server on a Raspberry Pi. On rare occasions it locks up so I plugged it into a Wemo Smart plug that's always on. If I'm not home and the server locks up, I use the Wemo to cycle power on it. -My latest idea uses a Raspberry Pi to sense when my air conditioner turns on. It then triggers IFTTT to turn on the Wemo Smart plug which has a fan attached to it to help circulate the air while the A/C is running.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
UPnP always falls short.,4.0 ,"The device is still based on the UPnP protocol so reliability is still a big issue. Otherwise it's the same as the switch without energy monitoring. I'm kind of torn between wanting energy monitoring or not. From what I've seen the switches spam the local network with energy info. These do not. If you're computer-savvy, do yourself a favor, and write your own UPnP client. Most of these switches will respond to a 'Discover' message if it's broadcast 3+ times (Search for ""timonreinhard/wemo-client""). You also may have to send On/Off commands multiple times. Hope this helps.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Great Uses,4.0 ,"I've been using the Wemo Insight switch for a few years and found it to be extremely useful, found another practical application - and decided to purchase the Wemo Mini. So far its been working well, it has recently failed a firmware update but seems to still be functioning normally. The ability for Wemo products to pair not only with the Echo, but now Google Home - and integration with IFTTT is awesome. I've found that the auto off timer does not work consistently for some reason so I've had to incorporate IFTTT to auto off the switch on a set daily schedule.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Pro Tips for new and old users alike!,5.0 ,"Love the redesign! Now I can plug two smart plugs into the same wall outlet. With this new version, setup was far easier than the old model. Some Pro Tips I discovered when setting my home up... 1) If your cell phone is connected to wifi using AC band, you'll want to switch your phone wifi connection to an older wifi protocol (a/b/g/n) before attempting to connect to the Wemo. It reduces the setup time tremendously as the app tries to be helpful and copy over your stored wifi settings/password information to the Wemo smart plug. (since they device doesn't support AC, it will fail by default). 2) It is very easy to test if a device could become ""smart"" by using this plug. Simply unplug something like your Air Conditioner (while running) at the plug. When you plug it back in, if the Air Conditioner turns back on, then it will work great with this plug. I now turn my fans and Air Conditioner on and off using Alexa! 3) When you setup devices, you can ""cheat"" and make abbreviations/synonyms work on Alexa. I setup my Air Conditioner Plug to be called ""Air Conditioner"" so it works by voice command. I also put it, as the exclusive plug, in a group called ""AC"" so my wife can also refer to it that way. It works!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Great product, great price. I highly recommend this for simple switch automation/Google Home integration",5.0 ,"I'm in the slow process of performing some minor home automation projects to integrate with the two Google Home devices in the house and was looking for a hub-free solution that was comparable in cost, but that avoided the additional cost of a hub. I bought two of these to control two lamps on my bedside night stands and a standalone lamp in my living room. It took just a few minutes to connect the devices through the wemo app and get them provisioned in the Google Home app. I've had them a few days at this point and I love it: it is so convenient to be able to turn lights on or off when getting home late just by yelling for the Google home to turn on the lights or, if I want to make sure I turned them off before leaving in the evening, to check the app and confirm they're off. While the Google Home can't yet schedule lights to turn on and off natively, the Wemo app can and the Google Home can do it with help from IFTTT. Overall, I'm very satisfied with these devices and I expect I will add more as I find new opportunities to leverage smart devices in my home.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Happy with my Wemo!,5.0 ,"So far, so good! I've had my Wemo Mini Smart Plug for a few days now. It was easy to set up, and so far, has done exactly what I've told it to do. I bought only the one plug just to test it out and see if it is truly a piece of technology that would work for me. It is plugged into an entryway wall socket and I've plugged a lamp into it. I've schedule the lamp to turn on and off at certain times during the weekdays to coincide with my morning and evening schedule. Before I get up in the morning, the light comes on so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark. About the time I leave for work, it turns itself off. Now I have one less thing to try and remember as I scramble out the door to work. In the evenings, it is scheduled to turn on around the usual time I arrive home from work, so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark when I get home either. And since it is easily programmable, I can change this setting as the days get longer. So far, there are no ""cons"" to the device. I can control this one outlet using my smart phone, which I think will be helpful. For instance, if I get in bed without shutting the light off manually, then I can pick up my phone and shut it off remotely. Another ""pro"" is that the device really does only take up one socket, allowing me to continue using the second socket for whatever I need it for. Do I plan on purchasing more? Yes. There are a couple more electrical devices that I would like to have remote control over. I'm also intrigued by the other Wemo wi-fi controlled products, especially the ones that replace regular light switches.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
WeMo Light Switch was a great purchase!,5.0 ,"We purchased the WeMo Light Switch so we could control the porch lights automatically through IFTTT. If you don't know what IFTTT is, you should definitely look it up! After a week of use, the Light Switch has worked great! The lights now come on automatically at sunset and turn off when it's time for bed. There are a few ways you can set up and control the lighting: 1) Use the WeMo app to set up a rule so the lights turn on and off at given time intervals. 2) Use the IFTTT app and sync it with the WeMo Light Switch channel and set up 'recipes' based on the time of day, your phone's location, etc. 3) Go old school and push the button when you want the lights on/off. We definitely recommend this to anyone who wants 'Smart' control over their interior or exterior lighting.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Very well designed switch ... Love it.,5.0 ,"I recently installed this switch (standalone) and really love it. Planning to get couple more when price comes down again. Little expensive for a standalone switch but the aesthetics, feel, usability and software are very nice and functional and also the reasons for my 5 Stars. I bought my first few WEMO (non-dimmer) switches in 2013 and since then I didn't see any progression towards 3 or 4 ways switches so finally had to move forward with other vendor (few days back) and changed all 3-4 ways switches in the house. Now why I feel that this switch is expensive? 4-way *** 1 Wemo WiFi Dimmer ($80) + $10 = 1 GE ZigBee Dimmer and Energy Monitoring Switch ($50) + 2 Add-On Switches ($40). 3-way *** 1 Wemo WiFi Dimmer ($80) - $10 = 1 GE ZigBee Dimmer and Energy Monitoring Switch ($50) + 1 Add-On Switches ($20). Single *** 1 Wemo WiFi Dimmer ($80) - $30 = 1 GE ZigBee Dimmer and Energy Monitoring Switch ($50) But I would definitely recommend this item for dimmable lights with standalone switches.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Never come home to a dark house again!,4.0 ,I had this installed about 6 weeks ago and has been great! I live in a condo where I really didn't have the option to install a motion sensor exterior light but was sick of coming up in the dark. I set this to turn on my porch light at sunset and it has worked flawlessly. I never come home to a dark house anymore and I can tell Alexa to turn it off when I go to bed. It's on a one-day deal for about $20 off today and I'm seriously considering buying another for the kitchen. I do wish it worked for lights that can be operated by multiple switches so I could install on in the living room but currently it's only a single-pole set-up (which is why I subtracted a star).,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Great Idea - Very Frustrating Set-up and App compared to other WeMO devices,3.0 ,"I like the idea of the product - but getting it to work can be maddening. I have the security camera and remote switch that were both simple to install and work just fine from the very first install. However, these switches seem to be finicky, fragile and took about 25 resets to get it working. After I finally got it working - there was a firmware upgrade and then it suddenly disappeared. Finally got it back, but then it keeps going 'Not Detected' in the WEMO APP. The light and timing rule still works - but I can't access it through the app unless I reset and hopefully get the list of Networks to connect to. I would guess that maybe one time in 20 you'll see the list of networks - so you are constantly going back and forth. Finally I deleted and reinstalled the Wemo App several times and that worked for a few days. The other WEMO products are consistently fine in the APP, but the switches keep going undetected. They do work - but you can't control them remotely when the go 'not detected''. Not sure if this is a hardware or software issue - but you'd think that if they got it right with their other products - they could figure it out for the light switches.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"We Use it Every Day, Very Responsive After Firmware Updates",5.0 ,"I have 3 of these WeMo Light Switches and the household is really happy with them. I would connect more switches in our home if the price gets cheaper. It's been the most used home automation gadget in our home. INSTALLATION Find the circuit breaker in your home and turn off the electricity to the light switch you are replacing - you WILL want to do this. I know you want to save yourself a couple minutes, but trust me, it's worth the couple minutes to avoid a life-threatening situation. Keep in mind that there are four wires coming out of this light switch and you MUST to connect 3 of them to make sure it's installed safely. There are two live wires (black), neutral (white), and ground (green). Only the ground wire is optional, you need to connect the other three to your light switch wiring - if your home doesn't have the neutral wiring (typically white or grey wire) in the light switch box, then you cannot install the WeMo Light Switch. We live in condo built in 2007 and our current light switches only have the live wires connected. I had to dig deep in the back of the light switch box to find the white/neutral wire - and we did not have a ground wire (typically green or copper). After taking off the old light switch, I used the wire nut to connect the 2 live wires which was connected to the old light switch - order doesn't matter, just connect one and then the other to each black wire on the WeMo Light Switch. Then I connected the neutral wire to the white wire on the WeMo. Then I capped the green wire by itself with the last wire nut. I shoved everything into the light switch box carefully to make sure nothing came loose. Every WeMo switch I installed was a big tight, since it is a little bulky. But moving the wiring around a bit, all of them fit snugly. After that, put on the faceplate, cross your fingers, and turn back on the electricity from the circuit breaker. I wanted to connected another one to a 3-pole switch (the one where you can control a single set of lights from two different light switch), but the site and direction said that I shouldn't. I think it'll be fine if I did, but I can see that the app and other connections (e.g. IFTTT) won't know if the lights are actually on or off. SETUP Setup was straightforward once you knew what to do. You first need to download the WeMo app from the App Store. Then you change the WiFi network on your phone/tablet to the new ""WeMo..."" network that now appears. On some Android devices, you need to selected ""Stay Connected"" when it prompts you that the wireless network doesn't have an internet connection. Once connected, launch the WeMo app and it should automatically detect that you're trying to set it up. From there, it's just naming the switch and choose your wireless network (only 2.4GHz networks will be detected, as the switch doesn't have 5GHz support). Keep note, that without fail, when I chose the option to ""Remember Network Settings"" the setup would fail and I would have to reset the switch and start all over -- not sure what the setting does, but I think it's best to leave it unchecked. USAGE The app is now super responsive, but that wasn't always the case. I've had the WeMo Light Switch for about 3 years now and in the beginning, there was a second or tow lag. But after the numerous firmware updates over the years, the light switch is very responsive to the app commands...I mean, you can rapid fire on/off if you wanted to. I would be careful about installing this around things in your house that would cause wireless interference with the 2.4GHz network - namely, for me, the garage door opener. I have a Liftmaster and I installed the WeMo Light Switch in the garage. And after installation, the range of my garage door opener took a hit. It wasn't enough to make it unusable, but still a slight nuisance. Oh, and connect this to IFTTT.com. I have found so many cool recipes to use with this.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Sufficient, but needs improvement to get beyond novelty status",3.0 ,"The Belkin WeMo light switch is more cheaply constructed than most in wall timers I have used in the past. The mounting flanges are of molded plastic as one piece with the rest of the switch casing. This plastic flange is thicker than normal and if used with other than the included single cover plate is not a clean install. In my use case I needed to use a double plate. This switch will accommodate standard cover plates, but the result leaves an uneven gap between the cover plate and wall. The discovery and addition to iPhone WeMo application and home network took more than 30 minutes. People who are not used to network devices and multiple firmware updates will be frustrated by this device. The iPhone software is moderately good; the Android is unuseable. Once the install is complete and if you manage with an iPhone, this device works fairly well. It's not a mature product and I can't say it's a serious piece of home automation equipment. Would a screw less double gang switch plate take care of the problem I am having as mentioned above??","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
A product worthy enough for me to review!,5.0 ,"I bought this switch to replace a manual switch to my jetted tub. My bathroom is rather large, and the builders put the switch on the opposite wall of the tub. I have a ceramic tile floor that can be slippery when wet. So for convenience, I decided to try this item. The install was a breeze. The instructions were easy to follow. The software set up was not difficult. I had to wait a little bit for all of the networks to be found, but it found it eventually. It is on my 2G frequency, but the 5G showed up as well. The app saw that there was a firmware update, so it did that right away. When done, the app and switch worked flawlessly. So now I don't have to get out of the tub to turn the jets on or off and I don't have to worry about slipping. I am 100% pleased with this purchase, which doesn't happen often for me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
So far so good and it was easy to install,5.0 ,"Update 4/6/2017: Finally got around to getting that third switch in! Still loving my WeMos. Forget IFTTT. WeMo has so many programming options I do not bother with unreliable IFTTT anymore. Still no issues and I've updated the firmware for the third time. Even my husband loves that we can turn off all the lights without getting out of the warm bed. Planning what switch to change out Next! Update 2/23/2017: I finally got IFTTT connected. Turns out there is no Wemo app for the iPad. I used the iPhone app on my iPad and even though it seemed to work, it would not connect my Wemo devices to IFTTT. Once I switched to the app on my iPhone, I was able to connect to IFTTT. I've also installed two more light switches. No longer do the garage lights get left on all night! Upping to 5 stars! I have had no issues with the switches and I've updated the firmware twice now with no issues. So far the only down side I've seen is the size of the switch itself. I have two switches for the garage lights installed in a 3 ganger. I would love to replace that last light switch with a Wemo but I have no idea where I'd put the wires. As it is I crammed the wires and caps behind the old switch just to get these two into the box. I bought and installed this with little electrical knowledge. The hardest part was getting all the wires back into the electrical box and getting the switch to lay flat. I installed it in the bedroom to control the overhead fan and light. The set up was easy and it works well with Alexa. I am having a hard time writing an IFTTT recipe. I keep ending up in this endless loop when I connect the wemo device to the channel. For this I took off one star. I've never had a problem writing recipes before and I use it to set an entire house schedule. With that said I just want to clarify that the switch cannot control the light and fan separately. It's either on or off. I have a separate remote control that I use to control them separately. It's a little complicated and will take some adjusting to but it works. I mainly wanted it so that my bedroom lights and fan were on a schedule guaranteeing that the would not get left on during the day. I can also turn off my bedroom off all at once with one voice command (nice when you start to fall asleep and don't want to get out of a nice warm bed!). I plan on buying more of these for those other lights that tend to get left on all the time light the garage lights.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"WEMOs work great, Technical help line excellent",5.0 ,"I have two homes. My second home is in an area with unreliable commercial power. Recent storms brought frequently interrupted power. My security lights on mechanical timers were about 12 hours off schedule. I had to make an unplanned drive of 3 hours round trip just to reset them. WeMo Mini Smart Plugs have solved that problem. However, another problem has surfaced. I set the routers at each of my homes to the same SSID and password, so that whenever I show up, my electronics hook right up. The problem is that when I am present at one home network, I can only view the WeMos on that network and not the WeMos at the other home. If I switch off the WIFI on the smartphone and use my cellular data, I see them all. If I go to a remote WIFI, such as Starbucks, I can see them all. I assume that If I changed the SSID's to unique names, this would not be a problem, but I have not tested it. Here is the good news, I am especially happy with Belkin's telephone technical help line. When I phoned to resolve this issue, the line was immediately answered by a live technician. I explained the problem and she provided the answers. If there is any down side, it is that there is not any PC access, only the smartphone app. I love them, wonderful devices. Now that I have cut my teeth on the mini switches, I have the confidence in the products to purchase the light switch WeMo.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
A great product if you are okay with using other apps instead of WeMo's,4.0 ,"This is a great product. I love home automation products, and I make sure to research each one before I get it. The price may seem a little steep, but from what you get, it's worth it. After the rather complicated setup process, the light will work like normal. The real value in this switch is that you can pair it with other apps to do things like turn on/off at sunrise/sunset; turn on when you enter the room (if you have the additional motion sensor); and turn on other switches and lights (with IFTTT). IFTTT (If This Then That app) allows you to set up all these things and more. Plus, you can use other people's setups (or recipes) so you don't have to configure everything yourself. I have 2 switches: the one in the garage is paired with a WeMo outlet plug to turn on a box fan when I turn on the light (necessary in Texas :-D) and the one for the porch light turns on at sunset and off at sunrise. I would not recommend using the WeMo app after setting up the switches just because it is very slow and hard to use. It has a couple features, but IFTTT is really the best way to use WeMo products. Pros: Looks great! Small light to find the switch in the dark Very customizable with other apps Timers Can control other WeMo products (if used with IFTTT) Cons: Electrical work (call an electrician if you're unsure of what to do) Clunky software Sometimes weak signal Need additional apps to get the most out of it Price No integrated motion sensor (this would be great for kids' rooms)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
As simple as home automation gets,5.0 ,"I bought one of these to test out. First I must say it was fairly simple to wire up. 4 wires to connect. 1 green ground, 1 white neutral and two black hot wires. One for the input and the 2nd is the output to your light or plug. Fitting this back into the standard size box was another story. It is a tight squeeze! Configuration was quick and it has never lost connection as some people complain about. I control my lights via a schedule or I can ""manually"" turn them on or off via the iphone. Of course if you are just walking by you push the button to turn it on or off. I really like the vacation mode. Vacation mode is a simple mode that randomly turns lights on of off in a given time period to simulate activity around the house. For example. I turned my away mode on and between 7pm and midnght the lights can go on and off for periods of time. Outside of the time frame, the lights stay off so as to not waste energy and no one would see them anyways. Update: Test went well. I am going to start adding these as needed around my house. I have two switches and 1 plug so far.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Works perfectly for us,4.0 ,"Love these. I installed them myself and it was pretty straightforward. I've wired light switches and outlets in our condo before so I have some experience with basic wiring. There are also multiple instructional videos on YouTube if you don't feel comfortable with home wiring. Also, setting them up and connecting them to wifi was pretty simple. We have multiple smart home devices on our network (Nest, Harmony remote, Hue lights, Smart TV) and we had no connectivity issues with our Wemo lights. We have one of these in the kitchen and another in our baby's room, I control them with my iPhone, my husband his android, and both of us use our Amazon Echo to control them as well. When combined with the Echo these lights are perfect for me to turn lights on without using my hands when I'm toting my newborn around. My husband also constantly leaves a trail of lights on wherever he goes and we both love not having to get up again to go switch lights in another room off. I am only giving four stars because there is no dimming feature which seems a bit ridiculous, with the price of these combined with current technology, it seems like they should have a feature as basic as a dimmer.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
"A fine choice, but be advised...",5.0 ,"I was intrigued by the fact that so many of these were available ""Used"". I read the descriptive information available and wondered why so many would find fault with a product that, on the surface, has such a basic function and, seemingly, should be so easy to install. I think it comes down to this: the Wemo Light Switch requires a neutral wire in order to function (this is not readily apparent in the description of the thing). In most homes built since the days of ""knob and tube"" wiring, this means a ""white"" wire must be present in your switch-box - and that white wire must NOT be connected to the switch you're intending to replace (nor to any other switch present therein). So peek inside your switchbox before ordering this switch and see if you have a good neutral (or several of them all wire-nutted together). If you don't, it's probably not worth the trouble of pulling a neutral to the location - it may not even be possible or practical to do so. I had neutrals present (the electrician who wired this house apparently pulled the lighting circuits through the switch boxes) so the installation was straightforward. The Wemo app was a free download to my iPhone, and its setup and marriage to the switch was quick and straightforward. Everything works fine, and I'm happy. But I might not be if I'd bought a fifty-dollar switch only to find I couldn't use it...","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Works Like Promised,5.0 ,"We have a light that is only switched from downstairs but is in our entry way that is open to the loft on the second floor where we like to use this light when watching TV. Being lazy and somewhat tech-inclined, we decided to solve for this problem with one of these switches. The install and hook-up to our wifi was pretty straight forward and worked on the first try (and I am by no means an expert here). The switch works flawlessly and is a really nice addition. We are even thinking of getting one for our teenager's room so that we can get their attention by turning the lights on/off when we want their attention (easier than yelling, texting or pounding on the door). In sum, we are happy and would purchase again.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
WeMo light switch,3.0 ,"First off this device does not include a dimmer function. Second it functions on your Wi-Fi network not Z wave. I have 4 echo's located in our home and have installed a lot of smart home devices so I have a good and in depth experience in connecting smart home devices. Connecting the WeMo was not as straight forward as installing Z wave devices with a Wink connection. The quick step guide is just that minus any in depth explanation, you'll need to go on line for the manual for that information. For the money there are better devices with dimming function for the same money. Your existing switch box must have a common wire the WeMo requires one. The WeMo works with Alexa/Echo and wink but again it doesn't have a dimming function which in a smart home is a must. 3 stars because it has no dimming function. If this device had dimming it would get a 5 star from me, being able to control our devices simply by asking Alexa to turn them on or off and scheduling them is what the 21st century is about.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Pre-set Timer rules don't work,3.0 ,"I like the idea behind this product, but none of the pre-set timer rules work. I am able to turn the plug on and off from within my house (I haven't tried doing so while not in my home). However, each time I select one of the pre-set timer rules, they don't work. Firmware is up to date, app is up to date; there's no reason that the rules don't work. It has the effect of introducing distrust about the product, and because I'm using the plug to make sure I don't leave a space heater running, knowing the plug is functioning is critical. Bottom line: If the rules worked, I'd give it a five star rating. Until then, I can't completely trust that it's doing what it says it's supposed to do.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Poor software and support,2.0 ,"I really like the idea - a smartphone enabled outlet and I went with Wemo because it's one of the more popular ones. Unfortunately I have been plagued with issues and support as of now has been unhelpful. The big one is that only the rules I created on day 1 work, any new rules I create do not save. So my day-to-day functionality is unaffected (thus 2 and not 1 star). Second, it did not recongize that Phoenix has no DST so even though that is the timezone on my device, the rules were an hour off until I reset to factory defaults. Third, the firmware does not upgrade successfully. To date I have been in a chat session with no success, so I will try calling next to see about getting it working. What a disappointment, I could have bought a cheaper competitor's product for this sort of lousy support.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
These switches were perfect. Despite seeing the negative reviews,4.0 ,"I recently moved into a new apartment where the light switches were not very conveniently placed. I also wanted to be able to turn my lights on while I'm away from home and planning to come back late. These switches were perfect. Despite seeing the negative reviews, I figured I should try them out anyway because I couldn't really find any other switches that seemed to be good of quality. Prior to purchasing these, I already own 4 WeMo Smart Plugs, so I already knew what I was getting into when it came to setting them up. The setup was pretty simple, although the box itself is a little big. I had a hard time pushing the switch into the electrical box because there were so many wires and there wasn't much space. I ended up just letting the switch and the panel stick out a little from the wall, not desirable, but good enough for me. Setting up the wifi can be a little scary, and I mainly blame it on their app. The app would crash a few timesin the middle of setting up the switches via wifi, and it was a mix feelings of ""did it work?"" and ""did I break it?"" as I continually restarted the app. Eventually it managed to get it all set up correctly though and now it works without a problem. I also had no major problems updating the firmware when it prompted me to. In conclusion, my main complaints about the WeMo Light Switch are how large the box is and the iffy setup process. I think really what they need to improve on is their app because I'm pretty sure that is what caused all my setup problems, however minor. It would also be nice if they allowed me to control WeMo switches at multiple homes instead of only one home. No, if you have 2 or more homes, even if both homes have the same WIFI names, you will only be able to access the WeMo switches/plugs at one of these locations. I had to learn this the hard way.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Works great with Alexa,5.0 ,"Got this as a xmas gift 2015. Been using it for 7 months now with no issues whatsoever. Works great with Alexa, as I say, ""Alexia, turn on the light"" and light comes on. Subsequently, does the same with turning off. If you don't want to use Alexa, it's a very easy push switch. I installed this in my kitchen and when coming out with hands full, it's been very convenient. the app for my smartphone works great and you can also turn it on and off with a phone. This came in handy when I though I heard someone outside my home at 2:00 a.m. I turned on the light from my bedroom (kitchen is in front of house). Not sure if anyone was out there, but if there was, the light coming on may have alerted them. I think you can name the switch, as I recall being given that opportunity when setting it up 7 months ago, so if you buy two, you can tell alexa to turn on specific switches (I assume). When light is off there is an unobtrusive white light (dot) on the switch. When light is on, there is a cool looking green light that lets you know it's connected to the internet. My internet went down once recently and it blinked orange to indicate no internet. Switch worked manually fine, just no web connectivity hence no alexa or phone access. this resolved when internet went back online and I didn't have to reconfigure.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa"
Easy to setup,5.0 ,"I set this up on my Alexa and the Kasa app in less than 30 minutes start to finish. I noticed that sometimes I would say the command, ""Alexa turn on lamp,"" and Alexa would respond ""ok"" without actually turning anything on. The issue was my 5-year-old router. I replaced the router with a new router that could handle more devices. The new router resolved the issue. I've been using this plug for a few months now and it is still working great.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Love it! Here is a hint for Echo owners,5.0 ,"The new Echo compatibility works very well and allows grouping controllers under a single group name. I just set up three controllers and now I can say ""Alexa, turn on the living room lights"" and viola, they're on! Much easier than finding each lamp's on/off switch on a cord behind a piece of furniture. I can also schedule them to turn on and off when we're away from home. Go to the TP-LINK support site for full instructions and to the Alexa app if you're using an Echo to control the switches. The set up was mostly straight forward once I read the TP-LINK full instructions, but below is an more detailed hint for part of the instructions that weren't clear to me at first. I spent about 30 minutes puzzling this out, but the rest was fast and easy. The controllers can be configured with Kasa to be ""local"" or ""remote"" connected. To be controlled by Echo each individual controller must be set to Remote Control ON, in the Device Settings menu. That menu is accessed in Kasa with this process after the controller is initially set up: From Kasa's home page tap the device name; a screen for that device appears, with selections for Schedule, Away, Timer, an off/on button and at the top right corner an icon that looks like three little sliders. Tap that icon to open the Device Settings screen and then slide the Remote Control slider icon to the right so that it lights green. Do that for all controllers you want to be controlled through Echo.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Excellent start for home automation but understand wider context,4.0 ,"TP-LINK Wi-Fi Smart Plug HS100 Review A couple of weeks ago, I purchased a Smart Plug (HS100) to confirm that the product works with Alexa (Amazon Echo) and provides easy, reliable, secure remote control of plugged-in devices. Pros and cons are below. If you use consumer Wi-Fi (IP) webcams (Foscam, etc.), then you may be familiar with this product's technology and potential concerns about security and privacy. A webcam contains a microprocessor which can be programmed (with network data, operational settings and user options) and controls a camera which may be monitored using an app. A Smart Plug contains a microprocessor which can be programmed and controls a power switch which may be monitored using an app. Both local (LAN) and remote (Internet WAN) control are possible in each case. After confirming that the Plug indeed works as advertised, I was more curious about how and where operational data (supplied via the app) is stored and secured. That is, I'm not sure if all operational data is stored on-board the Plug in non-volatile memory in case of extended power outages and to secure such data locally. If remote control is used, what's stored in TP-LINK's Cloud server? [A Vine Voice review on 1-23-2016 indicated that ""the plug has internal storage for its own status and the schedule. ... a copy of the schedule is stored in the plug itself and does not rely on having a persistent internet connection to function. ... plug does rely on the power to keep time so that it can act on scheduled events.""] If the Plug is like a Wi-Fi webcam, then operational data is stored on-board, as can be verified using a local web browser connection to the camera's built-in web server. A Smart Plug, however, does not provide browser access, whether it runs a web server or not [there is a http port]. Remotely using a manufacturer's app, whether for a camera or Plug, introduces Cloud-based data storage and collection. And because Wi-Fi webcams and Smart Plugs are computers, they can crash or glitch and need to be reset. That's why reliability is a key factor. Time will tell. The Plug has a 2 year warranty. So, setup was relatively easy, and I discovered (as other reviewers have noted) that the best (but not perfect) instructions are in the Support section of TP-LINK's website, rather than in the included Quick Start Guide. * * * [...] How to connect my TP-LINK Smart Plug to my home network via Kasa? How to make my TP-LINK Smart Plug work with Amazon Echo? * * * 1. Install the ""Kasa"" app on your iPhone. 2. Open Kasa. If you want to use the Smart Plug with Alexa (Remote Control), setup a TP-LINK (Cloud / P2P registry server) account; and, after receiving an email activation message, login; otherwise, you may Skip setting up an account for just local control. 3. With your iPhone on a local 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection, open Kasa and then: (a) plug Smart Plug into an AC outlet; (b) Add Device > SMART PLUG and follow the instructions; (c) which say to go to your iPhone's Wi-Fi settings and connect to the Smart Plug's Wi-Fi network and then return to Kasa; (d) customize your Plug -- with a unique name, etc.; and (e) connect the Plug to your local Wi-Fi (with or without Remote Control, but Alexa requires Remote Control enabled). To use a Smart Plug with Alexa: A. On your iPhone in the Alexa app settings (via ""hamburger"" icon), tap on Smart Home and then the TP-LINK Kasa item and login with your TP-LINK (Cloud) account name and password. B. Scroll down Smart Home and near the bottom tap Discover devices (search your Wi-Fi LAN) to add your named Smart Plug, which will then be listed. C. With Alexa, say ""Turn on / off (name of plug)."" Pros ‚Ä¢ Good package and product design (both hardware and app). ‚Ä¢ Works with Alexa without a hub. ‚Ä¢ Setup relatively easy. ‚Ä¢ WiFi connectivity provides 2-way communication for control and real-time status (unlike one-way powerline modules). ‚Ä¢ Remote access without router configuration (port forwarding) [probably using company's (or subcontractor's) Cloud / P2P server like most Wi-Fi cameras]. ‚Ä¢ 15A load max. ‚Ä¢ Can unplug from AC without losing settings in order to relocate unit. ‚Ä¢ Moderate price. ‚Ä¢ TP-LINK supportive with comments on Amazon reviews. ‚Ä¢ 2 year warranty. Minor Cons ‚Ä¢ No support for 5 GHz Wi-Fi (okay as long as most routers are dual band). ‚Ä¢ Plug socket on front rather than the side or bottom (like on X-10 modules) of unit -- cord protrudes even farther from wall. ‚Ä¢ Status LED always on -- no way to turn off (like on Sonos speakers). ‚Ä¢ With Alexa, limited to only commands to turn on / off. Cons ‚Ä¢ Size (see photos) -- bulkier than standard X-10 appliance module (longer and thicker); even thicker than X-10 Pro appliance module and around the same length. ‚Ä¢ Covers both outlets if plugged into bottom outlet; covers upper edge of bottom outlet if plugged into top outlet, making bottom outlet unusable. Concerns ‚Ä¢ UL certification Some reviewers were worried about UL certification (which is not marked on the product or box). The manufacturer stated that certification was obtained. I searched UL's Online Certifications Directory (database) and found a listing: XACN.E481494 Miscellaneous Controls Operating Control, Smart Plug, Model(s) HS100, HS110 Last Updated on 2016-03-29. ‚Ä¢ Heat buildup when connected to some (high wattage) appliances Some reviewers were worried about the Plug getting too warm. I have only connected LED lamps (~10 W) to the Plug so far; so, I cannot as yet comment on possible thermal issues. The manufacturer stated that the Plug ""will remain well within a safe temperature range."" ‚Ä¢ Security and use of encryption, e.g., protection of data stored in Plug's memory and TP-LINK's Cloud. The manufacturer stated: ""In order to control your Smart Plug remotely, a TP-LINK Cloud Account is required. Your Cloud Account is safe and secured, and remote access to your Smart Plug is controlled solely by you through the Kasa App. Cloud accounts and Cloud servers are an industry standard for Smart Plugs and Smart Home devices."" ""The Smart Plug does not hand over or transmit any password information to us; It receives Wi-Fi profile information from your phone during setup, in order to connect the Smart Plug to your router."" ‚Ä¢ Privacy (privacy trade-offs) The weighty Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pose questions about data collection and sharing of personal data, anonymized or not -- for marketing & promotion, including partners and other 3rd parties. ""Device submissions"" ... device names, groups, schedules, locations, ...""usage information"" ... Software limitations ‚Ä¢ No offset possible on sunrise and sunset timer, but can use Away mode for randomness. Questions 1. Security: Is Wi-Fi password saved only in Plug's memory or also in TP-LINK's Cloud? Encrypted? 2. Security: Are timers, schedule, Away settings stored in Plug's memory or the Cloud? Encrypted? 3. Plugs do NOT communicate with each other, correct? Only with the TP-LINK Cloud? 4. When the unit is unplugged from AC outlet, are all settings (defined using the Kasa app) truly non-volatile? Does the on-board clock re-synchronize via Wi-Fi on the LAN anyway when plugged into AC again? UPDATE 6-13-2016 Purchased another 2 Smart Plugs on June 3. New packaging has UL certification mark, as well as new graphics and description: old ""Wi-Fi SMART PLUG"" vs. new ""Smart Wi-Fi Plug;"" old FC and RoHS marks vs. new UL and RoHS marks; model and part number unchanged.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Fully integrated with Alexa!! Better than more expensive Wemo outlets. **UPDATE**,5.0 ,"**UPDATE** Sorry, I didn't know this review had gotten this much attention, but I will clear a few of my points up. I have been using the smart home devices for over 2 years now. I started with the Wemo (now have 4 outlets 3 this size and 1 insight and 2 wall switches) 3 TP-Link outlets, and 10 Philips Hue bulbs. All controlled with My Echo and 2 Dots. For the first year or so the Wemo outlets were a pain every time the power went out. Through firmware updates this is no longer the case and they work just fine now. I also was not using IFTTT at the time so it not having IFTTT support wasn't an issue for me. I have since been using IFTTT which is why I've personally gone back to using Wemos over these, but still use these on devices I don't use IFTTT triggers with. I'll also clear up the ""intergrated"" questions. Before February or March of 2016, when using these you had to say ""Alexa, tell KASA to turn on XXXX"" you still technically have to use a skill, just it only now needs to be enabled and linked and Alexa will recognize these devices individually when searching for devices like Wemo and other integrated devices. Sorry I didn't reply to questions/issues earlier, I didn't know anyone had replied to my review. Any questions my email is in my profile. **Original review** I have been using Wemo outlets and switches for over a year now and love the ability to have Alexa turn things on and off by voice. I decided to order a few more smart home devices when Amazon released the Dot since between my Echo, it's remote, and now the Dot I have voice control throughout most of my apartment. It just so happened these were on sale as a deal of the day at the right time, so I ordered 2. You will see some reviews that state these only work with Echo using a skill, that changed in February or March and they are now fully integrated with Alexa. Over the past year I've had issues with my Wemo outlets dropping connection, and anytime I lose power I'd have to set them up again. This isn't the issue with these outlets. They were very easy to setup and link to Alexa, the app walks you easily through step by step in setting them up, renaming them for Alexa and getting them online if you'd like remote access. After setting mine up I decided to move them to another room. With the Wemo outlets one I unplugged them I'd have to set them up again, not with these. One I plugged them in at their new location they reconnected with no issue. I highly recommend these over the more expensive Wemo outlets. I saw another reviewer complain these cover both plugs on an outlet, this is true of all of the smart outlets currently on the market, if this is an issue for you I recommend doing what I did in a couple locations and get a cheap pack of 1' extension cords. Most of my outlets are hidden from view anyway so using the extension cords wasn't an issue for me. Now off to bed ""Alexa, turn off lights"" (yeah, it's been over a year and I still giggle like a little schoolboy once in awhile over this)","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Not Ready for Prime Time. Totally unreliable access to, and control of, plugs. Terrible support made it worse, bricking one plug",1.0 ,"UPDATE: After TP-Link saw my review, I received an email saying they wanted to help and asking me to click a link to customer support. Despite not wanting to waste more time, I fell for it, thinking I would get a live chat or a callback. Nope. I clicked on the link, which required me to send yet another email. I did not get a response until two days later asking me to call the main tech support number (which ihad already spent an hour with before, as described below). I called twice today after getting yet another email telling me they were going to close my support ticket unless I called. Got the usual VM system. After being told each time that I was customer 1 on the wait list, within two minutes, the support service switched to another line or area, and kept asking me in Chinese and English to ""please dial the extension directly."" What extension? It gave no options. It repeated this message continuously. After a few minutes of hearing this repeated and no one picking up, I hung up. If I could reduce this rating to zero stars, I would. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Worked fine for a few weeks, then stopped allowing consistent local (via phone or tablet on same wifi network) control. Worked fine if I turned wifi off on my phone and connected to devices via Kasa app remotely. On wifi, sometimes the devices could connect, sometimes no, telling me to ""try again later"". Spent over an hour with various tech support people. Upgraded firmware on each plug. When they told me to then reset and reconfigure one device to test, the Kasa app (on phone or tablet) will see and connect to the new device, but will not let me add any new devices anymore because it will no go past the device naming screen (even if I attempt to leave the default name). So the update and reset made the reconfigure plug device unusable. The other devices I updated (but did not reset) and they work fine for remote control. But i still cannot control them via my devices if they are on the same wifi network. Another tech product that is supposed to make life easier, but makes it more difficult by requiring and wasting our time, by not reliably doing the very job they are sold. These ""Smart Home"" devices are dumb, and not ready for actual consumer use","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"A very good device for automating a light switch, but the WeMo app is superior to TP-Link's Kasa for scheduling",5.0 ,"I already own several WeMo switches, but when this TP-Link went on sale for one day at Amazon, I decided to use it to expand my system. Installation was identical to the Belkin F7C030FC (WeMo equivalent of the TP-Link). This switch requires a common line in addition to the two wires that connect directly to the switch. The ground is optional, but should be used if present. I had the switch installed in 10 minutes and downloaded the TP-Link Kasa app in order to pair the switch with my WiFi. Again, it works exactly the same as the WeMo devices and found my wireless with no problems. The software sets up any schedule or timer you want associated with the switch. In addition there are ""scenes"" you can create to do things like dim the lights. Unfortunately, my LED bulbs aren't dimmable, so the only thing that happens when I enable the scene to dim them is that they shut off. I like the idea though, and if I ever upgrade the bulbs it'll be a cool feature, one that isn't available on the WeMo app. The differences between the WeMo and TP-Link switches are minor. As an example, with the WeMo switch, the on and off times can be set up as one rule. With TP-Link's device it needs to be two rules: one for when it comes on, and one when it turns off. One thing I like much better about the WeMo is that you can gear events based on sunrise and sunset. As an example, turn the lights on 15 minutes before sunset and turn them off at midnight. Since it's an Internet-connected device, it will change the time every day by a minute or two. It's a bit strange that TP-Link doesn't offer that feature in their app as it would make it significantly more functional. On the other hand, upgrading the firmware is easier on the TP-Link than the WeMo. The WeMo pops up an alert telling you there's a firmware update for your device(s.) I've owned them for over 3 years now, and my experience is that installing the upgrade is a hit or miss affair. There is no area of the WeMo app that will allow you to trigger the firmware upgrade manually. The TP-Link, however, has a separate function under settings that will tell you the current firmware version and whether there is an update available. From there you can trigger it manually. It's a much better design, and more straightforward. I love the Alexa integration and had it up and running in under a minute. Now this light switch can be voice controlled as well as from my iPhone. The only real disappointment I have is the color. The switch is only available in white. As you can see from the photo that accompanies this review, it stands out against the beige switches that are already installed. It sure would be nice if these devices were available in the same colors as, say, a Leviton switch. To be fair, the WeMo is also only available in white, so if TP-Link decided to offer it in colors, I'd definitely consider it over the competition. This switch is installed in a room that is not highly decorated so I'm not too concerned about the mismatch, but I'd definitely hesitate installing it in an area like the living room where the difference in color would make a stylistic difference. In summary, a very good device for automating a light switch, but the WeMo app is superior to TP-Link's Kasa for scheduling. My advice is to wait for them to go on sale, as they do periodically on Amazon. I'd bet money that TP-Link will be adding features to their software in the future that will put it on an even keel with Belkin's WeMo switch.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Easy to install, works great with Alexa, could be better with IFFT support.",5.0 ,"I love them with Alexa and trying to curb my wasteful habits, but the only pisser is these use a few watts themselves. I have 8 HS110s and 5 of these and no other parasitic loads on the circuits these live on. With the fridge, garage freezer, and pool not cycling my house sits about 85w static, if I open the circuits where these live it goes down to about 45w, leading me to believe the 13 devices are pulling about 40w. Just to chase my tail a little I energized the circuits where these live, saw the 85 watts again, then unplugged the 8 HS110s, and it dropped by about 25w leading me to believe the HS110s are about 3w each, and these switches are in the same neighborhood. The Kasa app is a little sluggish but it's nice seeing the power of the HS110s and setting the away mode when I'm on the road.

Worked right out of the box,5.0 ,"Worked right out of the box. Followed the instructions and was able to get the switch installed and working. I intended to use this with Amazon's Echo and the only stumbling block I ran into was that I jumped the gun and tried to discover devices before adding the TP-Link Kasa skill to the Echo. In the Echo app: From the menu, go to Smart Home, then Get More Smart Home Skills. Search for Kasa or TP-Link and enable the TP Link Kasa skill. Enter the credentials you will have created from TP-Link. Then discover new devices and it should find the switch. FWIW, the TP-Link app has these instructions. Keep in mind that whatever you name the device in the TP-Link app will be what you can ask Alexa to turn on/off. If I named it Bob's Room, I can ask Alexa to turn on/off Bob's Room Light, Bob, Room, or Light (assuming no other devices share those words). Small note: if you want to rename you device (I didn't put light in the description initially), I found that I had to delete the device from the Echo and TP-Link app them re-add it, naming it what I wanted in the TP-Link app, then adding it back in the Echo app. If I just renamed it in the TP-Link app, for whatever reason it didn't update in the Echo app even if I deleted it then re-added it in the Echo app. All in all, it works great and it's great for those of us who argue on who has to turn out the lights at night.

Best in it's class,4.0 ,"The TP LINK HS100 is an excellent choice for a WiFi smart plug. Set up is easy with the KASA app and once you establish an account for remote control, adding additional plugs is a fast and simple. I especially like the icon selections avaliable to assign to the plugs along with unique names. The app works on both cellphones and tablets. Your phone/tablet and the smart plug must be configured with both on the same 2.4Ghz network, but once completed, the phone/tablet can be switched to an 11a or 11n network. This only works with remote control access or you are confined to ""local access"" under 11g only network. I recommend setting up multiple plugs on the same phone or tablet first, discovery and connection is quick and easy on the second device. I deducted a star for the bulkiness of the plug. I also have installed several units of the Power X WiFi Remote Smart Plug by Raynic Electronics, they are not as bulky and have a slimmer profile. You can control local or remote access with the TP LINK HS100, the Power X once configured is remote by default. When on remote you are server dependent and I have experienced server connection issues with both and had to manually control the on/off function of the plug. I recommend the TP LINK HS100 WiFi Remote Smart Plug as a starting point to creating a smart home, with or without the Amazon Echo and Alexa.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great switch if you've got space in your electrical box for it,5.0 ,"Great switch. Easy to install, as long as your electrical box has a sufficiently large volume. The back of the TP switch takes up about as much space in the electrical box as a GFCI outlet. You also need space for four wire nuts within the electrical box, since the TP switch relies on 4 wire-wire connections (as explained in Amazon's product description page). The one odd thing is that unlike conventional switches that look similar and toggle up/down like a see-saw, the TP-Link switch's lower part always sticks out and acts like a push button. You push the lower end to click the switch on and you push the lower end to click the switch off. Even if you were expecting conventional see-saw action, it would work fine: when you look at the switch and see the bottom part sticking out from the rest of the switch, that's what you'll naturally think to push. The WiFi connection was very easy to set up, and my metal electrical box did not interfere with the WIFI signal. The only thing missing is IFTTT (if this then that) support. TP-Link, get with it.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Works well so far, setup was a pain...",4.0 ,"This has been working well so far, and since it's able to interface it with both Alexa and IFTTT, it's extremely flexible to automate! I do wish it came with an Ethernet port to set it up though, because for me, the wireless setup was very frustrating! In order to supply your router's credentials to this outlet, setup requires you to connect a wireless device to a temporary Wi-Fi network with the plug. Doesn't sound too difficult, but it took me several dozen attempts to successfully connect to the outlet! After a failed connection, you're given the option to ""set up manually"", which consists of manually switching your network to the one supplied by the outlet. However, my connection kept telling me that I was in fact connected to the device, with no internet connectivity. Great, I wouldn't expect internet, but if I'm connected, why does the setup keep telling me that I'm not connected. The setup also helpfully states that maybe you should try again while being closer to the outlet. I literally had my phone resting on the device! So, I tried various outlets throughout my home in case I just happened to be trying to set it up in a wireless black hole, but to no avail. The only other wireless device that I have that I could use to set it up is a Kindle Fire tablet. Unfortunately, for some reason, the TP-Link Kasa app, that is used to setup and control the device, doesn't exist on the Amazon marketplace... Just when I reached my limit after dozens of setup attempts and was going to box the outlet back up and return it, it finally allowed me to input my router's credentials and connect it to my home network! Since attaching to my network, I've had no issues whatsoever with the outlet! So while I like the device itself, and it works great, I'm subtracting a star because the setup was beyond frustrating... If this device worked well, I was planning on purchasing some more. At this point, I don't know if I'll do that because while I'm satisfied by the way the outlet is working, I'm literally dreading trying to set another one up.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great So Far!,5.0 ,"I finally pulled the trigger this Prime Day and bought three of these TP Link Wi-Fi switchable plugs while on super sale. One controls two lights in my living room which I have linked to my Amazon Alexa account. A simple ""Alexa, turn on [off] my lights"" and it works great. The second plug controls my stereo power, and works great with my Alexa Dot which is connected to my stereo receiver through a mini 3.5mm stereo to RCA plug. Now, I have voice and smartphone control over my stereo, and can play Pandora and other streaming services hands free on my stereo' s connected speakers. Great to be able to control song selections and volume (using the Alexa App) for my rear yard speakers while standing in the rear yard. Very impressed with the TP Link switches, and note that when my wireless router goes down, the switches automatically reconnect within a minute or two (sadly, I have yet to get my Echos to automatically reconnect, yet). Only problem I had was setting up the first switch - the new Kasa account I established was not recognized, and there were no clear instructions either that came with the unit, or on their website. Customer service was non-existent - took two days for my emailed help request to be acknowledged. Anyway, eventually I figured out to remove the switch name from the app, and re-installed and renamed it, and the switch worked the second time. Time will tell if these expensive gadgets hold up, but they're working great so far! Oh, and the App (Kasa) allows one to set up timer-style programs, so my lights come on at 7pm and go off at 1am, unless I ask Alexa to override. You can also activate all your switches remotely using the Kasa App provided you have wifi or cellular access. Great stuff! Time to freak out the babysitter, heh heh!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
EASY Switching ACCURATE Monitoring,5.0 ,"This is so easy to set up and run from the app. Using it with Alexa required flipping some switches in the Alexa app, and, unfortunately, that information wasn't immediately obvious. However, once I found it on TP-Link's website, it was easy. (You just need to enable the Kasa skill in the Alexa app and tell Alexa to discover your devices.) Once you are up and running, the plug does an excellent job of switching and monitoring for a much more reasonable price than what else is out there. So far, I've not had one drop off the network or fail to execute a command from the app or from my Echo devices. The monitoring function within the app is easy to interpret and - according to my bill - is accurate. The extra set up steps make the TP-Link switch slightly less seamless than the Z-Wave and WeMo switches I have, but this is a very inexpensive way to monitor energy use and automate on/off routines. The switch is robust enough for small air conditioners and space heaters. I am happy with it.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works well but takes up space,4.0 ,"This device works well. I've set it up with my Echo Dot and it responds well. The set up was very easy. The Kasa application was also very easy. TP=Link has a website for customer service and product information in case you have questions. You set it up with Kasa and then you open your Alexa and set it up there. Integration is easy and fast. The reason I took off a star was that this will cover access to the second outlet on the plate. The design was a poor design and I am amazed that such a high quality product has this design flaw. I ended up using an extension. It works well on the extension but I don't know if that is a ""smart"" thing to do.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
How to connect to Alexa Echo! There are steps.,5.0 ,"I bought this to hook up with my Alexa Echo and had a little bit of trouble hooking it up. Once I called the US support line, they walked me through the troubleshooting and I got it to work pretty easily. There are a couple of steps to get it to work: 1) You have to install it correctly (For me: black and red are live, white is neutral, green or exposed copper is ground) 2) You have to install the Kasa app and ""find the switch,"" name it, and log into your home wi-fi. 3) You have to open amazon alexa app and download Kasa skill, then ""find devices."" 4) It should work. If it doesn't (like what happened to me), you will need to log into the Kasa app and make sure your switch is marked to allow ""remote control."" You can do this by clicking name of switch, clicking cog icon, then looking for the setting in top of list. 5) The name you set up in step 2 is what you use to control it. ie. ""Alexa, turn on KITCHEN"" 6) Look cool as your turn off and on your switch as you sit on your couch. I am slowly going to start changing out ALL of my switches in my house and moving into the future with this stuff. It is very cool that we are finally getting into the realm of the jetsons and out of the flinstones era of technology. Why lick stamps or flick switches when you can have Alexa help you do it all?","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Not sure why people are having issues,5.0 ,"I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are for. This product works great! I bought two and set them up with Alexa in under 10 mins. As long as you have a good WiFi connection and decent internet speed you will be fine. If you have a crappy router don't expect this to work well. The instructions are really not that hard to follow. If you want to waste money on a wemo device and spend the extra money on a hub be my guest, but I have had no problems with this device since I bought it.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
What Did I Do Before These?,5.0 ,"What did I do without these? I bought one to try on Prime Day. That's all it took. Pretty soon I was thinking of all the places it would be convenient to use them. The first one went on the bedroom lamp, because I hated trying to fumble in the dark to try to get light. I was always worried I'd tip the lamp over. It became indispensable when my arms were full of baby and I didn't have a free hand to turn the lamp on or off as I carried him to bed. The next one I needed was for the tall living room lamp behind the bookcase, followed by the overhead lamp in the office. Now I'm pretty sure I need a few more - one for the nursery lamp, one for the garage ... I'd even sort of like one for the Christmas tree. The thing we like the most about these smart plugs is not only can I turn them on and off just by talking to Alexa, I can also use my phone to turn them on and off if I'm not home. That means when it gets dark at 5 pm and I'm lugging groceries up to a dark house ... I can turn the light on before I even get there. I don't have to open the door and wake the baby to go downstairs if someone is coming home late. I can just turn the light on from my bed. I really, REALLY love these plugs. I'll definitely be buying more in the future.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
They also allow you to take pictures of the room to easily identify where the switches are located,5.0 ,"I bought two of these light switches from Amazon. I also bought two WeMo light switches from Lowes. There's basically no difference in setup, besides the fact that the tp-link light switches do not have videos with installation. You can watch the WeMo videos for help with installation. I did not receive anything free or discounted. I bought both switches with my hard-earned money. There is no difference in functionality. They both work well with Alexa. Cosmetically speaking, the WeMo light switch has a black circle that illuminates green when the light is off, and the tp-link switch simply in luminates white when the light is off and it does not illuminate when the light is on. If I had a slight preference, I prefer the tp-link switch because the illumination serves to show the switch when the room is dark. It is less expensive also. I would make a suggestion to anyone who has no Alexa compatible light switches. Buy all of them from the same brand, as WeMo and tp-link use different applications. So, if I want to use my phone or tablet to use the devices, I have to go into two separate applications. Both applications offer the same set up and allow you to change the name of your devices. They also allow you to take pictures of the room to easily identify where the switches are located. My only regret is that I wish they were all the same. It should be noted that I used to coupon at Lowe's for the WeMo switches and the coupon May the price the same ask the tp-link switches. I should have gotten them all the same. I also bought Alexa compatible plugs that operate lamps. I use the tuya smart application to operate my lamps. Therefore, this is yet another application, and I have to operate three different applications to control lighting in my home. Alexa can eliminate having to use multiple applications. If you are away from home and want to turn lights on and off, this is when different applications become a pain. Everything is working well and I love it. Another thing to know is that if you name your devices similar names, Alexa will keep giving you error messages. Do not use names like my lamp or my light, unless you have only one lamp or light. If you name the more specifically, you will not have the error messages that will call Alexa to state, "" I found multiple devices in your account with that name."" And it took me forever to figure out what the problem. I had names like my bedroom light, guest bedroom light, my lamp, and guest bedroom lamp. I simply removed the word ""my."" I changed it ""master bedroom."" It works perfectly but there alot more syllables for Alexa to understand. I found this very frustrating but this was not a problem with any of the devices. It was an Alexa problem.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"If you're looking for a wifi controlled smart plug, this is the one!",5.0 ,"I have both Belkin and TP Link wifi switches and plugs in my home. After having used both extensively, I have to say I wish I had started with TP-Link instead of Belkin. These plugs are easy to set up, respond quickly and don't randomly ""drop off"" like the Belkins do. Now, to be fair, Belkin has been getting better with each release, but my TPs never had the issues of dropping off, needing frequent updates, etc. Additionally, I put one of these OUTSIDE my house where the reception is not as good for wifi. It is in a weather shielded area operating a fan for us during the summer (California - so we do have a summer) in our storage shed. It has worked perfectly for a couple months despite the sub-optimal location. On top of all this, the TPs cost less. All that said, the TP app is not quite as complete as the Belkin, but it is quicker and easier to use for what it does. So, no deduction. Additionally, I have all of this stuff working with my Amazon Echo Dot and Alexa. Aside from the fact that my niece is also named Alexa (some of you get this and others don't :-) it all works great! If you're looking for a wifi controlled smart plug, this is the one!

"A bit chunky, but otherwise very good.",4.0 ,"For a parent with a baby that is awake every few hours to feed, I don't know why I waited so long to buy this darn thing! For someone who isn't tech-savvy, the installation was a breeze and fast ... even for a new parents with little to no sleep in the past 2.5 months. We got this for the nursery lamp in our bedroom so that when I get up to breastfeed, I don't have to walk across the room to turn on the lamp. Now, all I have to do is grab my daughter from the co-sleeper and simply say out loud ""Alexa, turn on the nursery lamp"". It's almost as simply as plug-and-play. The installation direction is very easy to follow - but I'll give you a summary. First, you will need to download a Kasa app - this is not avoidable. From the Kaza app, you can connect the plug to your home wifi, and everything is connected within minutes. You can then connect this to Alexa by going to the Alexa app on your phone. This device also allows you to set schedule for it to be turned on and off at a certain time or turning it on and off via the Kasa app - great if you are going to be away from home! CON - The plug is a bit chunky. After this is plugged in, it render the bottom plug of my 2 plug outlet completely useless because it blocks half of it. Hence, one star was taken away. This is a pretty bad con because plugs are like gold these day with all the electronic devices. I have to now move my humidifier across the room to a different plug because the existing 2-plug outlet can only be used for one of these smart plug instead. Bummer.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Questionable reliability,3.0 ,I have 3 of these. They generally work OK - far better than WiWo. However they have a very irritating quirk. 2 of them suddenly decide they are no longer associated with my account so local access only. One of them however keeps changing its mind and decides it can be remotely controlled. The other seems convinced it is bound to another account. Sometimes the Kasa app can't connect to the wayward unit at all. Both these units are essentially side by side and in a room adjacent to the wifi so signal strength is very good. Net - not really very stable if you want remote access. So recommended if you are ok with local access only or want to set it up for timed lighting.,"TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"world's worst customer service, many problems reconfiguring",5.0 ,"UPDATE: back to five stars because these just wirk! i bought some ekticity ones to compare amd i couldn't get them to configure at all! order two more of these same day delivery and they went in like buttah. i'm happy npw. gave this 3stars because it WAS 5stars, until i had to deal with customer service, which was <1star, to say the least. i got a new router, got it all set up, it wouldn't find my smart plug. followed the instructions, which were just a futile loop, a dozen times, then came here, where it advertises customer support 24/7 with no link where to get it. googled their web page, held a reasonable anount of time, finally connected to a girl who had absolutely no idea what she was doing, and barely spoke english. spent a futile half hour during which i told her what i was doing step by step, instead of the other way around, and finally asked to speak to someone else. there was no one else. supervisor. hold. horrible music. i tried reconnecting a couple more times, nada. then i got the bright idea to set up another, brand new plug which i was planning on doing next, anyway, and voila! it picked up the new router fine. went back to reconfigure that old one and voila! it now picked up the new router fine. she came back on the line to tell me the supervisor was too busy, and i very slowly explained to her what i had done. i have very little confidence that she understood. takeaway: IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE ROUTER ON ONE OF THESE PLUGS, YOU FIRST HAVE TO SET UP A WHOLE BRAND NEW ONE. it will then pick up the new router settings and connect to it automaticaly when you go back and re-set up the old one. this has obvious advantages, to them, and very blatant disadvantages to the consumer. i have been buying these one at a time as i convert each room to smart and had planned to buy several more. now i will buy another brand.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
a little larger than I would like but works flawlessly,5.0 ,"Tldr: a little larger than I would like but works flawlessly. I primarily use this to reboot my computer when it has frozen and I'm away from home. In the bios settings of almost any motherboard there is a setting to turn the oc back on in case of power failure. Enable this and you can now reboot a frozen computer from a distance. Okay so I was going on vacation and I use my computer to run my plex library, I really didn't want to get stuck without plex so I gave it some thought and realized I could create multiple failsafes for my pc and this is one of them. Computer crashes or freezes and I can have it back up in less than a minute. On to the product review. Using this product is stupid simple download and install the kasa app on your phone, plug in the adapter, pair them, connect the adapter to your wifi. That's it from there you can control that plug from anywhere you have internet access on your phone. The app itself is clean and simple as well boot it up and with one tap you can turn the outlet off or on. The hub is a little large and will need to sit in the top outlet to not cover up the other one, this is the only downside, I really wish it was a little smaller.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Highly recommended smart switch. It is great!,5.0 ,"Our electrician was installing some outdoor lights and he put the switch in the basement of the house. To simplify matters, I wanted a light switch that I could trigger remotely and after ample research I settled on this one and have not been disappointed. Here is a quick summary: Pros: 1. My electrician had no trouble installing this although I think that it required a neutral wire which was not an issue for us 2. It was very easy and self explanatory to setup with Wifi and no additional hardware was required 3. It has a little circular light on it which helps you to see it in the dark 4. The Kasa app works well and can control the switch from anywhere 5. It also can easily be controlled via Python scripts if you want to code something yourself 6. It works perfectly with Alexa Cons: 1. The switch is one way meaning you push it like a button. It does not stay in the up or down position as a normal switch. 2. It is a bit confusing that the switch light is on when the light is off and vice versa Overall, I am happy with this purchase. It works better than I expected and I am very happy with it. I would highly recommend it to others.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Simple, Intuitive, Effective, and Reliable Plug.",5.0 ,"UPDATE 10/28/16: We are still very happy with these two plugs, as they have worked great with our devices. We are using the Amazon Echo Dot to control them, and set up was incredibly simple. The devices were identified right away by the Alexa App and Alexa is able to control them instantly (before she finishes saying ""ok""). We connected our devices to our local demand response program (OhmConnect) and these devices have worked perfectly to turn off our devices at these crucial times to maximize our savings. They are certainly a fantastic tool for the environmentally-conscious consumer. We have been so impressed with these that we have since purchased several other TP-LINK smart home devices, including their smart bulbs and smart switches. I have a few suggestions for improvement, but overall we are very pleased with these smart home devices from TP-LINK. Suggestions for improvement : - integration with IFTTT - integration with Siri/Homekit - smaller footprint to make it easier to use the outlet below - additional device icons representing a larger range of lights and devices - default Remote Control feature to ""on"" - add ability to export or download usage data from the energy monitoring - add more sophisticated energy usage statistics (graphs?) - fix bug when setting up devices on ios phones that prevent the wifi setup from working on the first try ORIGINAL REVIEW 9/27/16: I wish all smart home automation products could be this simple. I purchased two of these plugs last week, and I could not be happier with their performance. They are as close to ""plug and play"" as one could hope for. Once the app is installed, setup is a breeze, and the devices can be connected to your wifi in less than one minute. I found for both of the plugs that I received an error message while connecting to wifi the first time around, but had no problems the second time. Once they work through this very minor issue, setup will be perfect. I found that the Kasa App is very intuitive. I appreciated the variety of icons to choose from so I can easily tell at a glance which device is which. As I add to my collection, I may find the choices a bit limited. I have one of my plugs connected to a refrigerator, and I was surprised to not see an icon for that, but I suppose many people probably do not need a timer for their refrigerator. I use mine to automate turning off my fridge during Ohm Hours, as I participate in the OhmConnect program (if you live in California you can get paid to save energy during specific hours through their demand response program). I love that my connected devices can be shut off automatically at these crucial times and then powered back on when the energy saving hours pass. I also find it fascinating to track the energy usage of this power-hungry device throughout the day. I have the second device connected to our TV power strip, so our vampire home entertainment system devices no longer waste energy throughout the day. I have the timer function set up and it works flawlessly. I love the fact that I can easily control this from my phone, both in my home and anywhere in the world with an internet connection. I have found that the response time is incredibly fast, which I greatly appreciate. I am looking forward to testing these devices out with the new Echo Dot once that is released. Based on my initial use of the plugs, I assume that the Alexa integration will make a great item even more user-friendly. I will update this review if I encounter any issues that would warrant a decreased star rating. In case you are wondering about the behavior of these plugs in the event of a power outage, I contacted TP-LINK support and I have been informed that these plugs are capable of remembering their previous state and will resume that state when power is restored. This is a huge relief! So, if you have this plug attached to your fridge, power will be restored to your fridge when power is restored to the rest of your home, which is the best you can expect. Also, if you have the plug attached to a light, and the light is off (perhaps because it is the middle of the night), then your lamp will remain off when power is restored. I was concerned about lights potentially coming on in the middle of the night during a power outage, as this is the behavior of the Philips Hue bulbs. However, these smart plugs and the TP-LINK bulbs are all smart enough to remember their previous state and avoid waking you up or wasting energy. I look forward to trying out additional TP-LINK smart home products (I have one of their bulbs on order) and seeing how their products all integrate together. So far, I have been highly impressed. The one big limitation that I have found that I hope will be addressed in the future is the lack of HomeKit integration. I have to use the App (if away from home) or Alexa (if at home) instead of using Siri, which just means that these devices cannot be controlled centrally in the new Home App like my other devices. I knew about this limitation in advance and still love these plugs, but would like to see HomeKit integration for the plugs and light bulbs and light switches in the future.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Good product semi ok customer support and only ok setup directions.,4.0 ,I gave this product a 4 star review not because it is an inherently bad product but because the install was not as easy as was stated and the customer support listened to my issue and told me the switch would probably not work where I was trying to use it... But in the time it took them to come up with the answer I had figured out how to fix the issue myself and now its working great. This would be a 5 star product had the customer service behind the product been a little better. My issue with installing it came with the fact that you need a neutral wire. I knew this was the case and my home is new construction as of 2010 so I knew I had neutrals in all of my boxes so I wasn't really concerned with that. Once I went to install it though I had multiple neutral wires in the back of the box and from most things I read it wouldn't matter which neutral wire I used and this seems like it is true as I got the switch installed and my power back on everything looked good! Even got it connected to wifi... But then when I went to click it on for the first time the light flicked on then the switch rebooted and the light shut right back off... I couldn't figure out what was wrong as I wired up everything just the way it stated to so I tried giving customer support a call.. I got through to someone pretty quickly but it was pretty apparent within a few minutes of talking with them that they had no idea what was wrong and the conversation wasn't the easiest to have as the English was pretty broken... Eventually the lady on the other end of the line told me to take a picture of my wire setup and she would forward it up to her higher level department and call me back within an hour. So I did this and continued to trouble shoot the problem myself... So I tried tying the neutral wire from the unit into the big bundle of neutral wires in the housing instead of just one and then it started to work perfect... Wasn't to long after I got it solved that customer service called me back and told me the higher level came back and said that it wont work with my setup. So when I told her that I got it figured out she asked how I got it working so after telling her she said thank you and told me to have a good day. Once I got the units installed they work great and its really nice to be able to control the lights through the app or through my echo with my voice. There is not currently Smart Hub support for this product but there is a work around for that if you dig enough online and the price point for these switches is about 10 bucks cheaper than the other options out there which when you talking about 20 light switches in a home adds up quick!,"TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great set of smart plus,4.0 ,I really enjoy these general smart plugs. It would have been 5 stars if the TP-Link server to Alexa was not down at times. Since you mostly control the lights and switches using voice and Alexa it is irritating when the Alexa to TP link server is down. happened twice in a two week period. But recommend this for sure. You won't regret the ease of use and voice control. With the Alexa connection the setup of groups of smart plugs is even better. Great value! I purchased several of these.

Smart Plugs... they're for the kids.,5.0 ,"My husband and I love these smart plugs. We purchased them right after we purchased our Echo Dot. I thought it might be nice to be able to ask Alexa to turn lights on and off. We have 2 set up in our living room for our two lamps. I did not realize how valuable these were until the first night my daughter would not go to sleep. When she can't sleep, we come sit in the rocking chair in our living room. I asked Alexa to turn on the lights as we came down stairs, we grabbed a blanket, got all settled, then I asked Alexa to turn off the light. It was perfect; no fumbling with covers in the dark. Then we purchased 2 more for our son's room. We have a TV in his room for him to watch Netflix. He has the habit of staying up all night watching TV, so we were looking for a solution to cut the power to his TV at a certain time at night. We had purchased a surge protector that had a timer, but you had to set the on and off for the same time every day. For some reason when the power would be restored to the TV, the TV would turn on. This meant that the TV could be on all day while no one was home. We also have string lights taped to his ceiling that were on a timer. After those solutions didn't work out so well, we purchased 2 smart plugs. I can set it up so his TV turns on early on Saturday - Monday, late afternoon Tuesday - Friday. I can also set it that it turns off earlier during week nights than on weekends. My biggest favorite is that my son has not figured out it is controlled by an app on my phone. The other night, it was past the time that his TV was off, but he wanted to finish watching his show. I was able to grab my phone and set a 30 minute timer so the outlet would turn off in 30 minutes. No crawling behind dressers, just a click on my app. It's also perfect that we have this string lights set up. I have them set to turn on at 8 and off at 10. But with the app, I can turn them on earlier, turn them off later, change the on time or the off time. It has definitely made parenting so much easier. I'm looking at getting some of these for my daughter's room.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
These Plugs are great!!,5.0 ,"I have one connected to a standing fan and another connected to my lava lamp. When ever I travel and forget to turn off the lamp I can do it from the app. I also turn it on about 30 minutes before I come home to get the lava flowing. ITs been great for the standing fan as well in the summer where I set it to a schedule and turns on to cool my bedroom down or when I'm lazy in bed and its too cold I just use the app to turn off the fan. I also purchased the LB120 and have that on a schedule to turn on and off and can change the color from daylight to soft white. My next project is to replace light switches where I cant put LB120 smart light blubs with TP Link HS200 switches :) I have them all linked to Alexa and created groups too where I can turn them on or off. I can say Alexa turn on bedroom and it will turn on the LB120, fan, and lava lamp. Or, Alexa turn on lights and it will turn on the LB120 and lava lamp. Or I can say turn on fan and it will just turn on the fan. I can officially transform in to a couch potato once I reach home!

Works well; easy setup with Alexa and Home,4.0 ,"I installed this to control the lights on the front porch, so when we come home at night, we can turn on the lights from our phones, before leaving the car. Once installed, setup was easy, as I already had the Kasa app for wall plugs, and the Kasa app was already linked to Alexa and Google Home. After a refresh of connections, I could control the switch from my Echo Dot, Google Home, and Android phone. Installation was into a crowded two-gang outlet box, which in addition to two light switches, also daisy-chained power down stream. So there were several connections of 12 gauge wire in the box. I replaced the existing single-pole toggle with this switch, and the neighboring 3-way toggle with a 3-way ""Decora"" style to match the look of this. Adding to the space issue is the size of this switch. As typical for these smart switches (I've also used the Leviton z-wave switch), the unit is much deeper than a ""dumb"" switch. This switch also uses pig-tails rather than screw terminals, so required another wire nut within the box, plus folding the additional pig-tail wire into the box. The positive to this is the stranded pig-tails allowed easier insertion of the unit into the box, rather than flexing solid wire if using screw terminals. Pros: * Setup was easy, especially since I already had other TP-Link Kasa devices * While only using for a week, so far has worked well, and response has been reliable * Works with Alexa, Google Home, and Google Assistant on phone Cons: * Size: these are deeper than standard switches; but this is typical of smart switches. This can be an issue if installing in a crowded junction box. * Only one color: white. Similar products include interchangeable faces for ivory and brown, to match existing switches Also: * Comes with a screwless face plate. I personally don' like the look of those, some people do. I prefer the curved edges of traditional plates. Also, since my installation was into a two-gang box (two switches in one 4""x4"" box), I could not use this plate if I wanted. I would trade the plate for interchangeable faces. * Uses pig-tail wiring, rather than screw terminals. Takes more spaces, but eases insertion into the box, compared to folding solid wire with screw terminals. * Has an always on white locator light. It's not very bright, but still another glowing piece of electronics. Something to consider if intended use is someplace like a bedroom.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
The perfect smart plug to pair with the Echo,5.0 ,"Previously I purchased another brand of smart plug which was smaller and less expensive, but the smart plug could not seem to operate or pair with my Amazon Tap. I attempted to get support on how to install the plug and got no where, so had to return both of the smart plugs. At the suggestion of the Amazon representative, who was probably the best Amazon Echo tech representative I have ever spoken to, I purchased the TP-Link Smart Plug instead. Upon receipt of the plugs, after finally downloading the correct app, (it appears I may not have read the instructions completely and downloaded the wrong app and wasted about an hour screaming about the fact that I could not get the stupid thing to work)....still getting use to the unmanly thing of reading instructions. Anyway, once the correct app was downloaded, it was an extremely easy process to set up the smart plugs on a number of devices...It is terrific not having to go into a dark room and hunt for a light to turn on, but simply say ""Alexa turn the bedroom light on."" It has only been a few days, but will be ordering a few more. My suggestion would be to order this product if you want to pair with Amazon Tap or Echo...it may be a bit more money but in the long run you will save from pulling your hair out, and you will reduce your stress level....and also perhaps read the instructions a bit more closely than I did....","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Pretty much as advertised, but not perfect",4.0 ,"Once in place and set up, the plug seems reliable and works as described, but potential buyers should be aware that: 1. The plug is large and bulky. If used in a standard duplex outlet, it effectively blocks the second outlet. In a quad outlet it will probably block 3 out of 4. And it isn't pretty, protruding about 2"" from the wall. 2. It requires a grounded outlet. Not surprising, but if you use it with an extension cord, the cord must have a ground pin. 3. The app (Android) is kind of klunky. It works, but I find it very annoying to use. The widget is about as worthless as you can imagine, so you probably will never use it. Controlling the outlet requires you to open the app, wait a few seconds for it to start, select your device, toggle it on or off, and back out of the app after confirming that you want to leave. Truly stupid design for something that just requires an on-off button most of the time. 4. It is not supported by IFTTT, probably a major drawback for many users. Works with Google Assistant OK, but in practical terms I find that using its native app is faster than talking to Assistant. All that said, not a bad deal for the money, provided you can live with its shortcomings.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great when working!,4.0 ,"Overall I'm satisfied with the Smart Plug. It is very easy to set up and works most of the time. I have purchased two of these at different times and both times there have been delays after set-up before I can turn on remote control from outside of my home network. Once it is set up and remote control can be activated, it works great. For a while. On two occasions in the short time I've had these, they have come up as ""local control only"" - after they had been controllable via the Internet. The first time, TP-Link did send out an email saying they were working on a known issue (kudos to TP-Link for the pro-active customer service!) and they resolved the issue by the next day. The second time, this past weekend, only one of the devices (the first installed) was affected and it showed ""local only"" again. When I went into settings I was told the device was not linked to my account. I had to delete the device from Kasa, factory reset the Smart Plug, re-setup the Smart Plug and it popped right up in Kasa with the old name and everything - working fine. Hopefully they are just having a few hiccups and this will not be a continuous process to keep them working. When they work, they work great! I'll bump up to 5 stars if these issues do not continue.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Device is good, Kasa app is mostly good -but needs more data on device information screen",4.0 ,"The product itself works very well. Very easy setup and good reliability. In order to use it remotely (which is a key purpose), you use the Kasa smartphone app. The app itself also works very well. My one issue, which is HUGE for my application, is that the Kasa app, in the device information screen, does not provide the remote IP address of the Smart Plug. So if you have a device that you need to log into (remotely) plugged into the Smart Plug, and the IP address changes (DSL internet with dynamic IP address assignment), you are out of luck until you can get back to the physical location of the device and look up the new IP. The Smart Plug and Kasa app do manage to find each other after such a problem, so clearly the app knows the IP address. It would be such a simple thing to add this useful information to the device information screen in the Kasa app. ....hopefully somebody at TP-link / Kasa will fix this oversight and make the device useful to those of us that need to login to remote devices at dynamic IP locations.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Easy to setup, easy to use. Would be nice not to have to connect to the cloud.",5.0 ,"Easy to setup/use/configure. Just plug it in, use an app, find the devices, configure. Voila! The cloud has great advantages for getting past routers, configuring the devices with ease, etc., but then you are connected to the 'cloud' outside your home. For security reasons, I really don't like that. But so far, it's been stellar! The connectivity is excellent, unlike other TPLink experiences I've had in the past. Having so many devices on WiFi seems like a bad idea, but so little information is transferred, it won't hurt performance on your router/access point. Response is instant, too! Press OFF, it's off, press ON, it's on...no waiting. I did notice a slight delay - 1 second perhaps? - when we were in Canada, connecting to our home in NYC, but... not bad! Looking into getting their cameras, which look interesting. Just don't like having all this access to the inside of my home, and my schedule, somewhere 'up in the cloud.' Makes for a terrible potential for an inside job. But for what it is, it works very well.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Very good in non-hot locations,4.0 ,"Been using these timers for the past 60 days. Pros: only occupy one outlet, quick and easy connection to home router, Kasa app is very easy to use, multiple settings available down to a minute, can use sunrise and sunset times, easy to check to see if timer is on/off and what the future settings are, easy to turn on/off remotely, programming has been reliable since installed. Each timer is connected to a low wattage device. Cons: Did not realize these have an operating range limit of 104 degrees. One was outside and the day it hit 105 the wifi function stopped working. The timer continues to operate the program that was last input but I have no way to change that. If you plan to use one in a potentially hot location, like in a dry outdoors location or an indoor outlet in So. AZ that gets afternoon sun you might experience the same problem. There are other units with higher ratings. I only deducted one star for that as post-wifi demise I researched and found it is clearly stated the unit has an operating range of temps.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
I decided to try the smart plug out as a part of a low key,4.0 ,"I decided to try the smart plug out as a part of a low key, simple and affordable smart home option for fixed income seniors who live alone and like me don't find their way around in the dark like we used to. This was to be a simple solution to lighting the path to the restroom for that 3am nature call. Plan was an echo dot and some TP Link gear with a simple Alexa control macro. Just like on TV, you issue a simple verbal command and voila the lighting to the bathroom comes on. Simple safe and affordable. The TP Link with kasa control works as advertised but The Echo Dot and Alexa don't see or enroll The TP Link devices. Performance to the dollar, the TP Link is a very good performer and a good value as well. So 4 stars. All feature descriptors say the the Dot and Alexa work with TP Link gear but much of what I do is smart home integrations with Control 4, Ring as well as various thermostats, irrigation, solar security and myriad other toys that will work via your phone or numerous other remote devices. Its not my first rodeo. The unit is good, very good but not suitable for use in an Alexa system in my experience.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"works well, feels a bit cheap",4.0 ,"I didn't want to get into a whole ""system"" as I primarily wanted this for 1 light so this is perfect. I will echo what some others have said - due to the fact that it has pigtails instead of screw terminals, it can be a tight fit depending on your electrical box, but installing it was a very straight-forward affair (if you've ever done this kind of thing before that is). It works very well. It didnt get 5 stars from me for 2 reasons 1 - it feels a little cheap if you're operating it manually. the switch button feels like it's made of a thin plastic and the ""click"" sound also sounds hollow and cheap - that's not to say it will fail or anything but I think the tactile feedback should be more reassuring 2 - the software, while decent, lacks in one key area - widgets. it does support one type of widget but for something as simple as toggling one light on and off, it doesnt have a simple ""toggle"" Aside from these (minor) gripes, everything works as intended and the whole process was painless.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works Perfectly in a 220v Region... All features as advertised.. Lifesaver!,5.0 ,"Got these from the US amazon store to take overseas in a 220-240V country, they work flawlessly. I was skeptical at first, but a FAQ on the official TP-link website confirmed the smart switches were universal voltage UNLIKE the smart bulbs. Here's the excerpt below: "" Q: Do our Smart Home products support multi voltage? Can I bring the smart product to other countries for using? A: For smart plugs and smart switches, they both support multi voltage and work in the range of 100-240V. While the voltage standard marked on the label complies the local market standard. Smart blubs do not support multi voltage, and may cause damage if the voltage is different than what is on the label. For HS200, since size and specification varies for different regions, if you take it to another region, it may cause some installation and usage problems. Note: TP-Link does not have a global RMA policy, so we recommend to only purchase products in the region you plan to use them in."" An important piece of advice : Make sure you get these with an appropriate mounting box, chances are your wall socket designs are different from US specifications, Personally I got this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0028CIC8U/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 for $5 at the time of this review, a total of $45 for such a great set up! Can't beat that!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Will buy more; easy with Echo/Alexa as well as the app,5.0 ,"I was frustrated by this packaging at first -- very sparse, limited instructions. However, I searched you tube for a video on this exact product, and found a ""how to"" made by someone not related to the company, just a user. With that video's help (go ahead and search for it now), setting up this product with its own app as well as to use with my Echo device was a breeze.

Easy to set up,4.0 ,"Just finished installing 2 switches. Easy to set up. Kaza app on my android smartphone quickly found the switches and allowed me to control the lights from my phone. Enabling this skill on the Alexa app was also easy and the switches respond quite well. I have 3 dots. Only issue so far is that I could not activate remote control on either switch: I get an error message saying the devices had been previously linked to another account (which is weird since I bought them directly from Amazon). Suggested solution is to factory reset, which I have not tried yet. This, however, was not an obstacle to pair Kaza with Alexa. Nothing in the printed material shows were the reset buttons are, but they are right below the switch on front.The one on the right restarts or reboots the switch with one click. The one on the left puts the switch in configuration/discovery mode (needed to pair it with Kaza) if pressed and held for 5 seconds (green/amber LED blinks). Hold it for 10 and you will factory reset the switch (amber LED blinks rapidly).","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Nicely designed, reliable, and a cost-effective solution!",4.0 ,"I see a lot of one-star reviews in early March, which is when Kasa had a service interruption. TP-Link sent out an email on March 2 that said ""we recently learned that users are experiencing an issue..."" The email went on to describe the error messages (e.g., Alexa saying that the device is not responding), along what a statement that ""our smart home team is working to identify and resolve this as quickly as possible."" I received another email message on March 3 saying that the problem was resolved (I had already noticed the restoration of service). Anyway, take the reviews on or about March 2 with a sizeable grain of salt. Except for this brief, system-wide glitch, this little product has worked very reliably (as have the TP-Link bulbs I purchased last year). Were it not for the outage, I might have given this five stars, when its low cost is considered. The setup is easy and fast, although it is important to follow the directions for both the Kasa app and Alexa. One hard-earned lesson - if you happen to change your password for Kasa, make sure you make the change on the Alexa side too. I like the compact design of the plug, in that it leaves on outlet open for other uses. The Kasa app works fine, although we generally use an Alexa voice command to operate it. We are currently using the Smart Plug Mini for a large floor lamp. Not much more to say about this little device - it just works! That's my review. Gonna take a nap now. Alexa, turn corner lamp off. ""OK.""","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Plugination,5.0 ,"I have had not a single issue with these (HS100 2-pack). Very easy to connect using the Kasa app. They work great and stay connected. The Kasa app is intuitive and extremely dependable. The fact that Kasa works with Amazon Echo is a huge plus. I have used one of these outlets for a compressor that I have mounted up high in my garage. I tell Alexa to turn on my compressor and voila, I'm cooking with gas. Before using this outlet, I had to just plug and unplug the power cable to the compressor. I have since purchased the HS110 w/energy monitoring and I like them even better. They are just as dependable and it's nice to have the energy monitoring. I would like for the energy monitoring app to have a little more to it, but you get the basic numbers; enough to know current usage, last 7 days, and last 30 days. But, don't plan on storing information, or going beyond the 30 days unless you take screen shots and keep track of dates yourself.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Pretty neat and easy to pair with my Echo Dot,5.0 ,"I love it! It was easy to set up and connect with my Echo dot (Alexa). The app must be downloaded and an account created with Tp-link. Once you have that, you can add the skill to Alexa and Alexa can search for your TP link devices. The Smart plug is customizable so you can call it ""lamp or bedroom light"" and ask Alexa to ""turn on my Lamp"". It's pretty cool! The plug is however a bit over-sized and covers my other outlet plug, other that, It's great to have at home. I am planning to get another one for my room and try the switch as well. I bought the Smart Switch and Smart Plug and I love both. The Smart Switch was easy to install as well. I am no electrician but I just watched a video online by Tp-link on how to install the smart switch and I was able to replace my old toggle switch to the Tp-link Smart Wi-fi Light switch in a few minutes. The switch itself is a little bulky in the back so I had to cut some wires in the switch box in order for it to fit inside wall and cover with the switch plate. But I love how I can command Alexa to turn my kitchen lights on and off when I am far from my switch.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Good WiFi home automation module if you don't want to invest in a hub.,5.0 ,"I bought this to dip my hand in the whole home automation world. Installation was simple and I was able to pair it to my home connection and my Kasa account. The commands are pretty responsive (strobe light party!!!) and the options for scheduling are pretty handy! I have decided to return it, not because the product was bad or defective, but because after calculating the cost of going all the way on TP-Link, it would be cheaper for me to go with a Z-wave system and a hub. Each z-wave module is about $5~$10 cheaper than each of the TP-Link or other WiFi modules. The other con with WiFi is that range could become an issue when you have a module installed in a far away point of your house. Z-wave works like a mesh, where each module repeats the signal for other modules to find and repeat again. This ensures that your whole house is covered by the hub. If you only want to automate a few lights and don't want to invest in a hub, go with WiFi modules like this one. They work very well. If there's a sale in the future, I might even pick one up again.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
A video at YouTube really helped to get the 3-way sitches out and the new switches in.,5.0 ,"Installing this switch was a bit intimidating, I have to admit. Wiring anything is a challenge, since so much is at stake. As an example, burning down the house comes to mind. However, I am happy to say that all my apprehension was unnecessary once I got comfortable with the process by watching a YouTube video entitled ""Installing wemo and converting 3way to a single pole switch."" Though I was installing a TP-Link switch, the task was exactly the same. I quickly got the steps I had to follow from the video. Those 3-way switches came out quickly, the rewiring to a single-poll was no longer a mystery and the installation of the TP-Link switches was straight forward. The guy that produced the video has received lots of appreciation from viewers for making the steps very clear and to the point. So far, the switches are working perfectly, with Alexa as their new master.

Happy Customer - But Please Make Them Smaller,4.0 ,"I am happy with these smart plugs. I now have 5: 1 controlling a window AC and the other 4 controlling lights. They were all easy to set up and add to Alexa. The first two I purchased had the energy monitoring. That feature is nice for the small window AC that I have running in a renovated attic that does not get as cool as the rest of the house with just the central AC. I do not find the power consumption feature worth the extra cost for lights that at most run a couple of hours a day. I love the schedule feature, especially for the little AC as it does not have any timer built in and runs non-stop unless you manually turn it off. Turning on my lights by voice with Alexa is awesome, and I no longer have to reach over and turn out a light once snuggled into bed (yeah - warning - these things can make you lazy). Being able to turn on a light remotely is another great feature. I can be at girl's night and turn on the living lamp for the dogs, or turn on the lights, so I do not have to walk into a dark house. My only complaint with these devices is the size. They are not outlet friendly if you have other grounded or transformer style power cords. I had to purchase adjustable power strips where I was using the plug with other electrical items. If TP-Link could redesign these so you weren't losing half of your outlet, I would give them 5 stars.‚Äã","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Best ones out there for Alexa,5.0 ,"I'm running 7 of these with Amazon Alexa and an iPhone. Set-up is a breeze, connecting with Alexa is a breeze. One of the easiest things I have set up. I travel a lot and use these to set lights up to look like I'm at home, run air filters, turn on/off speakers and make sure things like the coffee pot is turned off. The key is to have a strong wifi signal. I have two high end wifi access points in a 3,000 sq ft house that are placed for full coverage. Realize that signal decreases whenever the signal has to pass through something. I have one plug the occasionally looses connection that is placed the furthest from the access point. Probably only 60ft away but the signal goes through 3 walls, two TVs, a bed and a nightstand. That is actually a lot for the signal to get through. Most don't realize how much a phone or tablet boosts its internal antenna to stay connected.

Great for Smart Home Noobs,5.0 ,"Why did I get this? Did I need it? After buying an Amazon Echo, I eventually realized that I could do a lot more with the Echo than just play music. While my kids love to dance in the kitchen with one of their playlists from Spotify, my favorite use of the Echo is the smart home automation features. These smart plugs are what convinced me (and my very skeptical wife!) that these things could really change our lives (in the non-existential kind of way). What does it do? The smart plug links very easily to the Echo via your home wifi network and the free Kasa smart phone app. It allows me to turn on and off lamps and appliances with simple voice commands (‚ÄúAlexa, turn on/off living room lamps.‚Äù). It works exactly as it says it would! Does it work as it should? Because we have small children that we seemingly are always chasing around and picking up, it‚Äôs nice to have an across-the-room, hands-free option to turn on/off appliances and lighting. My favorite use is turning off our lamps in our bedroom after we‚Äôve already laid down and don‚Äôt really want to get up again. The way I think of it is that smart plugs are like the clap on/clap off feature that was sold on TV when I was just a kid, but even better because of its Alexa-enabled features. Is there anything I really love about this product? I have smart plugs in every room of my house connected to every lamp. I love that this smart plug only takes up one of my outlets. The regular/standard TP-Link Smart Plug (which we also have) works similarly but it annoyingly takes up both outlets because of its bulkiness. The Smart Plug Mini is great because I still have access to the other outlet and barely costs more than the standard smart plug offered by TP-Link. Is there anything I really dislike about this product? When the smart app (Kasa) went down and lost connectivity with Alexa, that was really annoying. Because I had gotten used to just using Alexa voice commands and because it took me a while to realize that the Kasa service was out, the TP-Links were useless as we sat in darkness. Is there a better product? There are lots of similar products that I‚Äôve tried, but this smart plug mini is the best smart plug that I‚Äôve used‚Ä¶ certainly better than the WeMo smart plugs.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

"Works great, wife hates them.",4.0 ,"Bought two of these for my living room lights that are plugged into switch controlled outlets. Great because I don't turn off my phone charging station every time I turn off one of the lights. I'm using them with my echo and was very easy to set up voice commands to turn on/off either switch or both at the same time.

Get TP-Link not WeMo,5.0 ,"I love all of the TP-Link products. I have 2 bulbs and 3 outlets so far. I tried the WeMo outlets at first, because I crazily didn't realize that each vendor would have a unique app for setting up, scheduling, and controlling the functions. As a comparison, the TP-Link devices and app were super easy to setup. Each time I get a new device, I plug it in, go into the app to add it, 10 seconds for it to find it on the network, and I'm ready to set the schedule or wherever. Documentation is decent. The Belkin WeMo, on the other hand, after an hour of trying it out, an hour of being on hold on their HelpDesk, a other hour with a LiveChat that was clueless, and a phone call from their HelpDesk the following say, I just boxed up the five outlets and sent them back. Their documentation makes it look simple, but there are conflicts with using their mobile app and some Smartphone settings, so you have to disable them before installing prodicts, and then it still doesn't work, and so you have to reset the devices, and on and on. It was a mess. I used to install computer networks for a living, so I consider myself a fairly savvy user of technology all products. Documentation is bad on their website with obvious steps left out for troubleshooting. As far as this plug goes, it is the size of a plug-in three outlet device that I have--sticks out about 1.25"" from outlet. It has a button on the right to turn on/off the plugged in device manually.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
It's great after you figure it out yourself. It goes on sale for a good price,4.0 ,"I really am having a ball with these, like everything else there is a particular way they have to be set up and instructions are thin on the internet and with the product. The company seems to be based in Europe and the support pages don't even offer information on this product, they seem focused on everything else they sell. But I stumbled upon someone who gave me the number to a live tech support person and from there I figured it out. I use mine with Alexa and it is the first system I have gotten to work any from home. I was in Colorado Springs turning my lights on and off in Wichita Falls last weekend. The setup for each outlet is pretty straight forward, plug it in, wait for the flashing amber and green light, go to your wifi settings on your phone, find the Tp-link in Wifi, click on it, go back to the next step in the Tp-link app, it will show available Wifi signals on your phone, pick yours, put the correct password and in a few seconds, that should be all. Once you get the Kasa app set up and turn the 'remote' switch on under settings for each switch in the app, Alexa can then find them in discovery mode. Even Amazon tech support didn't seem to know you had to have that switch turned on in their app to make it all work, it's not on under default. Once Kasa is set up and you give each outlet a good name, I started with one two three, which didn't work out. Longer names turned out better with distinctive sounding names that didn't sound the same like tall or all or living room or dining room. I ended up just dropping duplicate room names and say 'turn bedroom on' or 'turn dining' on. To change room names you have to change the name in Kasa, forget the name in Alexa app and then rediscover it. Not to difficult once you get it right. In Alexa app you have to go the skills section and link the Alexa with Tp-link. It may be different when you do it because they were in the middle of changing it when I was doing it. Echo customer support will help you, they are great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it has such poor instructions. Another foreign made product that didn't give America much effort in translation.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Installation revealed design flaw,4.0 ,"During installation, the switch went into an endless reboot loop. This was caused by a slight overtightening of the bottom screw. If you run into that problem, back out the bottom screw a bit to see if it fixes the problem. The reason this occurs is the placement of the reset buttons below the main switch. When installing this all-plastic fixture, the housing tends to bend, actuating the buttons. I hope that TP-Link can come up with a better mechanical design that prevents this from happening. That being said, the switch works well when controlled via an Amazon Echo Dot. Does anybody need a voice-controlled switch? Hardly, but it does add a nice futuristic touch to the house;-) If they could come up with switches for three-way configurations, that would be even sweeter since most of our light fixtures are wired that way.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Easy to set up, work great!",5.0 ,"Very pleased with these. I'd been wanting some smart plugs and there was a sale. Setup instructions were very clear, and setup was easy. You install an app to your phone or mobile device to set up the plugs. They do require a 2.4mhz band, and you must connect your phone to that network to set up the plugs, but once you've done that, you can connect your mobile devices to your faster network. There are also clear instructions for setting these up to work with your Amazon Echo, which works great. You can also set routines to have the lights come on and off or control them remotely.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Works good, as long as you have the apps in your smartphone to set it up with",4.0 ,"The Device worls well. Two drawbacks. First, it is big so it may interfere with the 2nd plug in a standard wall outlet. The smaller Smart Plug is more expensive, so I went with this one. The second drawback, you have to use the KASS App on your smartphone (iPhone or Droid) to set this up and control it. To like it to Amazon Echo, you then need to like the device AFTER you set it up with the Kass app via your Amazon Echo App. So it is really dual app dependent to set up. Once you link it to your Alexa app, you are good to go with voice control. If you are not going to control it with the Amazon Echo, then you are good to go with just the Kass app. Note, if you change the NAME of the device in the Kass App at a later date (say you originally called the device Bedroom Light and changed it to Bedroom Plug) then you muse DELETE the device from the Amazon Alexa app and Re-Search Devices to get the new name to voice recognize.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Finally! Plug control without a hub!,4.0 ,"We purchased this product to get a start in direct home automation using Amazon Echo and the Alexa app. We didn't want to commit to an automation scheme that requires a specific hub, and are hoping more devices are introduced that don't require a hardware hub. I was able to get the plug working locally with my phone in a matter of a few minutes, using nothing other than the quick start guide that came with the plug. While the process is straightforward once you understand the sequence of steps, getting the plug working with Alexa took a bit of time to figure out. For everything to work, you need to have the Kasa app on your phone, set up the plug for remote access (ensuring you've connected it to a 2.4 GHz password-protected visible network), enable the Kasa skill using the Alexa app, have Alexa discover devices, then create a group that is named the same as the devices you set up for your plug using the Kasa app. Then all you have to do it tell Alexa to turn on (or off) using the name. You can also set up on/off schedules in the Kasa app, making it useful as a vacation timer, for example.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Closed to outside online support, not compatible with hardly anything other than TP-Link web services",4.0 ,"A currated product. Uses TP-Link Kasa home app for internet connectivity over home wifi. You can't address it direct. Not compatible with ""many"" common online services, just now partnering with Amazon Alexa. Its really a closed eco-system and not in an Apple reliable way. I like TP-Link products but they are actively seeking to avoid the riff-raff of compatiblity with this line of products. If your looking for something you can expand with and hook into all sorts of online services.. Look elsewhere. There are ""hacks"" online and at Github.. but they are just apatheic with this product and the whole Kasa platform.

"Warning- very very large, may cover both sockets even if you put it on the top",4.0 ,"I found that even when I used this in the top socket, it took up enough space to cover the bottom one as well-- if you have a standard lamp plug in the bottom, it might work, but I had a grounded surge protector that would not fit. I ordered an adapter to allow me to continue to use both sockets, but leave this plug on the wall-controlled switch for people that need to turn the light off without using the smart features. In terms of the smart features, they seem to work just fine-- setup of the device was no better or worse than other things I've configured already, and integration with the Echo was straightforward and easy. The only negative that I have for this device is that it makes me want to go out and get 5 more for all the other lamps in my house. EDIT 7/14/16: So one more negative-- as of this date, the switch only works with the native app and Alexa. If that's all you're looking to do, probably not a big deal. But I was hoping to integrate this with my Harmony Hub, so I could control the lights in my home theater from the same remote I use for content. No dice, not even through IFTTT at this point. Given that this is currently the top-selling WiFi switch on Amazon, hopefully deeper integration is on the way soon.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Great Wi-Fi Smart Light Switch, even better when you have Google Home or Amazon Alexa",5.0 ,"I installed this in place of a Z-Wave smart switch and I couldn't be happier. It is installed for my porch light, one that sometimes we forget to turn off at night or want to have on when we are not home. I've set it on a schedule for night, it turns on and off like clockwork according to the schedule and it was much easier to configure than the previous Z-Wave. Since I have both Amazon Alexa and a Google Home it's great that this works with them. I can ask if the light is on or off or turn it on or off via Alexa or Home. I plan to figure out what other switches would benefit from scheduling and likely installing more. I'm pretty happy with the Kasa app as well which is how you control it, however I usually just end up interacting it with it through Google Home and don't have to worry about the app beyond initial set-up.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Alex, Bedroom On",5.0 ,"A simple thing that makes life a little easier. We have three of them and use our Alexa and Dots to turn various lights on and off. Sounds ridiculously simplistic but you really find it useful when you are going into a dark bedroom with your hands full. Sure, you can turn the wall switch on but it is much easier to tell Alexa, Bedroom on, as you walk through the kitchen and the light is on when you get close to the bedroom. I originally got one to turn the bedroom light off so I wouldn't have to get up to turn off the wall switch after reading when I wanted to go to bed. Now have three and am very happy. Of course they can turn off and on anything plugged into them but we find the lamps to be very suitable. we can even turn the interior lamps on from our car when we get close to home. The TP-L's can be controlled from anywhere you have internet access using the KASA application.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Combined SmartPlug and WiFi extender,5.0 ,"I'm overall pleased with this product. It does require a bit of hassle to setup (via PC) but is worth it. For me the best feature is actually the network cable plug on the right side of the device, to which you can connect things like computers or gaming consoles to get faster network speed than through WiFi. I am now able to get a file transfer speed of 8 MB/s between my downstairs PC (plugged directly into modem) and my upstairs PC (connected via this product). This is compared to the 2.5 MB/s at best that I was getting via WiFi. so that's a big improvement. I also am able to get better WiFi upstairs and in my back yard than (further away from my router) than I did when only connecting to my router. As for the Smart Plug, it works just as well via the Kasa app (and Alexa) as my other SmartPlug outlets.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"It does everything the product description says, and it does it very well",5.0 ,"Rest assured, it looks like they worked out the early kinks. This thing does exactly what the product description says, and it does it well. I bought this so that I could set an on/off schedule for my cappuccino machine. It works perfectly. The setup is simple, with clear instructions on a single side of a small card. It was up and running, hooked into my wifi within five minutes. The app is well designed. Simple and elegant, I have easy scheduling control with as many on/off events as I like, and simple manual on/off control. I was concerned that it would be too big and bulky, and potentially cover both outlets, but it's fine. I'll be buying more as the need arises, as you can easily control multiple units within the app. I highly recommend this bad boy!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Very useful WiFi range extender,5.0 ,"The TP-Link AC1200 Wi-Fi Range Extender/Repeater works very well. However, it was very difficult to set-up. The application on my phone kept locking-up at odd times, like when naming the device or entering passwords. I was forced to close the application and start-over. Also, the instructions are confusing when directing the entry of passwords, for example it does not distinguish which password to enter, the TP-Link product's password or the existing WiFi network's password ? It took an hour to get it to work. I finally had to use the provided Ethernet cable and connect to my computer to get it to work. Then, when I tried to connect my separate TP-Link SmartPlug to this extender, that too took an hour due the application on my phone locking-up. In the end, they both work well with Alexa !","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great little plug!,5.0 ,"I bought these to try as the placement of lamps and switches in my apartment is rather awkward, where you have to walk way into the rooms to turn them on, and by then you've already tripped over yourself in the dark. These plugs are fantastic! They only take up one outlet and leave the other wide open if needed. Super easy to set up via the app and with Alexa and I have basic, 12 foot extension cords plugged into them which are working fine. On those nights when I'm coming home from work in the dark, it will be nice to just flip the lights on without having to worry about setting up timers. I'll definitely be buying more and while these are on the ""pricier"" side compared to some of the no name brands, if they keep working as smoothly as they appear to, they'll pay for themselves 100 times over.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Setup (using my android phone) was easy. The android app had easy instructions for getting my echo configured and worked fine. I read some comments about incompatibility with house wiring - don't believe those are accurate. My house was built in 92, and all the devices work fine.

First device in my home automation setup.,5.0 ,"I bought this to replace an old timer switch for controlling my outside house lights. I needed something that I wouldn't have to change as the days got longer/shorter and twice a year for daylight savings. This has perfectly fit the bill. Installation was straight forward and took all of 5 minutes. If you have even a basic understanding of light switch wiring, you should have no problem installing this yourself. Once installed, I fired up the android app, kasa and started the search for the switch. The first time I tried, the app said found the device, but couldn't add it to the app. After the 2nd try, the switch was added to the app and added to my wifi. I was immediately able to turn off/on the switch from my android phone! Pretty cool. Then from the app, I created a schedule to turn on at dusk and off at sunrise. The app also shows daily run time, average run time for the week and month. After the app was setup, I turned to my Echo to get it setup. It was easy as searching for the skill to enable, and then going into the alexa app on my phone to find the switch. Probably took 2 minutes total to get it running and responding to voice commands on my Echo. Overall I am very pleased with this switch and will probably be buying several more for my house.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great Wi-FI switch to use with Alexa,5.0 ,"I purchased the wi-fi switch to control several LED lights on a single switch in my kitchen. I have been using this product daily, controlled by Alexa, for months without any issues at all.I did have to modify the switch cover a bit as this switch is in the middle of a three switch bank. I had to trim the plastic ""stand off"" tab off the cover to accommodate the ever so slightly bigger switch. It took 14 second with a box cutter. I love the Alexa application and Echo / Dots in my home. Especially when I forget to turn out the lights when I leave the room. I have everything in a ""House"" group so at night I can simply say, ""Alexa shut off the house"" and everything goes off for the night. I would not hesitate to recommend this product.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Fantastic. I've left Belkin WEMO for the TP-Link,5.0 ,"I bought 5 of these and love them. Easy to install and every single one works the first time. I had WEMO but was frustrated by the price and some challenges from time to time. I still have 2 WEMO but I will probably replace them over time. I use this with Alexa as well as the KASA app that comes with it. This is exactly what I was looking for. No hubs, no challenges. It just works right out of the box with very little setup. I tried the philips bulbs but given how many lights I have on a single switch, that was VERY expensive. In addition, I find these more reliable and easier to use. I also do not need any color settings. Only thing I wish it did was provide a dimming option which it does not do. I will only buy these from now on.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Easy to install, +10 lazy attribute",5.0 ,"Giving this five stars as I haven't found a valid reason to deduct. Installation was fairly easy and straight forward, everything you'd typically need (except tools) was in the box. The wiring and ""hole"" in my place was a bit tight and that made hooking up take a bit longer than it should, it was no fault of the product though. It works as expected and though it only supports 2.4 GHz wifi, that's not really a drawback. I have my 2.4GHz access point on a different network than my phone and Google Home but both were able to find as well as communicate with the switch. Being able to use the app and interact with the switch is extremely useful, the integration with various ""Assistants"" is extra icing on the cake and in fact has made me lazier as I can control it with my voice. I have yet to use the scheduling portion, it does seem flexible for general use. I'm not sure of you can have a very granular recurring event (i.e. once a month on this day only). I do believe I saw options for recurrence, I just haven't used it.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works great with Alexa,5.0 ,"This is a review of a free product received from TP-LINK as part of the review program. I was excited to install this switch, as I wanted to test out the Sunset/Sunrise feature and see if it really turns on at the appropriate time as the sunset time changes. Up here in Seattle, the sunset ranges from 4pm to 10pm throughout the year, so I've got specialty sunset/sunrise timer switches on my porch lights that adjust with the shifting sunsets. These standalone switches cost about the same as this wi-fi switch, but the TP-Link switch is controllable via smartphone app and Amazon Alexa, which makes it a way better deal. Installation Tips: as noted in the title, this is a single-pole switch. I totally overlooked that and mistakenly tried to install on a 3-way switch, which didn't work, so don't bother. The instructions require the neutral/white wire to be connected. Usually that wire is not connected to the 2-way switch you're replacing, so you can trace the wires back that are connected to the switch to where they come out from the wire bundle and find the neutral/white line. I had to pull out all the wires to get to it since it was tucked behind these wires. Setup was pretty easy/straightforward. You'll need a smartphone with the Kasa app on it. The App will go try and find the device by switching the Wi-Fi to search for the device which broadcasting on a TP-Link Light switch name. Once the app connects to it, it will ask you to enter the password for your Wi-Fi so the switch can connect directly to it. Once it's done, the app switches back to wi-fi and you can control it from your phone. The switch can used locally, but if you want to set timers or use Alexa to be able to control it, you'll need to turn on ""Remote Control"". The sunset one was the one I was most interested in. I went into the device and selected Schedule to turn my light on at Sunset. The app automatically uses your GPS coordinates to determine your location, which I assume figures out when your local sunset occurs. There's nothing that tells you when your light will turn on each day, it just says Sunset. If you back out to the Devices view, you'll see what time it's scheduled to turn on. I actually have the HS100 on my network too. If you have multiple devices, the Sunset setting gets confusing. Sunset is actually a ""Scene"" so you won't be able to setup another devices to turn on at Sunset via the Device->Schedule method described above. You have to go to the Sunset scene and edit the behavior. Here you can add more devices to turn on at Sunset. The one thing that this switch really needs is a dimmer function. With all the lights being changed over to LED, they are all dimmable. How great would it be to say ""Alexa, dim light to 50%"" or program home theater scenes to adjust lighting. Perhaps TP-Link will come out with a 3-way switch with dimming for a next version that will solve this.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

They worked out great! Simple and easy to use,5.0 ,"After being a little hesitant about trying home automation things in my house, I decided to buy the amazon echo. It was over from there. I added a few of these smart plugs to the house and they work perfectly. Setup was a breeze. It took less than 5 minutes to be connected to my router and on the home network. It will require you to create a account with TP-Link but these days everything does. The app is simple to use and is designed to work instantaneously when you hit the on and off button. Tons of custom settings if you want to get into timers and other security features. You can keep adding more smart plugs to the same account without any trouble. I wish these smart plugs would shrink in size a little but all in due time. I am glad to see TP-Link is starting to come down in price. Honestly that was the only thing holding me back from more of these guys. Price needs to drop to make a viable option for everything to have a smart plug. After setup and plugged it in and named it and setup it on the app, of course I decided to use it with the Amazon Echo. Discovery on the Alexa app went perfect. It discovered all the smart plugs and that was it. After that using the Echo to control the plugs was as easy as say ""Alexa turn on family room lights"". Works flawlessly, perfectly every time. I wish everything could work perfectly together like these two products.

An Outstanding Device,5.0 ,"The device is exceptionally good once you upgrade the firmware. You can control from any places. The setup is kind of 'complicated'. First, the wifi SSID must not be hidden. Second, the wifi signal to where you want to install the device may not strong enough. My signal is having about 70% but still not strong enough to have it connected. The router must be operated within this module's frequency. My router has a dual frequency and it won't work. I have to disable the higher frequency to suit. I have three units of this module. The setup cannot complete automatically. You must use manual set up and change your own wifi SSID to the one from TP Link. After finishing the setup, you can go back to your normal wifi. The firmware upgrade is very difficult to locate. From the module itself, it checked and said no upgrade available. I have to google many sites before I found the upgrade. The instruction on how to use the zip file is not clear either. With the upgrade, the module can be controlled remotely and the router SSID can change to hidden. The functionality of the device is very good and it is worthy to spend the effort to fix the various issues. I should knock down one star but keep five as to show the outstanding quality of the device itself.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Odd Shape Interferes With Adjacent Plug, Otherwise Works Great",4.0 ,"First, this plug works extremely well. I use it with my Amazon Echo. The only down sides to this are the size and shape mean that the plug partially blocks the second receptacle in the outlet you plug it into. As long as you leave that second receptacle empty or use it only for something with a narrow, two-prong plug, it's fine. I doubt that a three prong (grounded) plug would fit next to this smart plug in the same outlet. The only other minor drawback is that unfortunately, these smart plugs don't appear to work with the Apple iHome app. Presumably the other model that has the Zigbee / Bluetooth capability should work with the iHome app. But if you use an Amazon Echo, you don't need the iPhone app. It would just be nice to be able to use a single app to set time of day rules for this smart plug as well as devices like the Philips Hue system. Not a deal breaker, but would be nice.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
They are fun and work well mostly.,5.0 ,These work great when they are working. I have seen other reviews saying the same thing. I noticed something today I hadn't turned on my home PC in quite a few days and I notice when this happens after a while all my tp-link switches go off line. My switches haven't been working for 2 days. But today I turned on my computer and switches all started working. I am thinking it has something to do with DHCP. Maybe configuring the router to give each switch a static IP is the cure. Just a thought for those having problems. I have had problems like this before with other things such as a Synology NAS running a PLEX server. I was able to reach the PLEX server from anywhere via my iPhone. BUT only if my home computer was running which still makes no sense to me. Maybe there is some sort of authentication involved that the computer must do that expires after a set amount of time.

For me one of its biggest pluses is that a visually impaired person can set it up without sighted assistance because the Kasa app used to configure it works very well with Voiceover once you get past the point where you have to select the device you are programming. I get a kick out of being able to control it with the Dot and it is also very cool to be able to set the timer with the app if I want the light to be on at certain times or I could connect it to my coffee maker and have my coffee waiting for me in the morning.

Not reliable,2.0 ,"I bought four of these and one of them wouldn't ""see"" the wireless network when I tried to set it up and my 30 days from Amazon had just run out. . Kudos to TP-Link for replacing it. But the problem I have is they are very unreliable. I have two in my home and two in my office and they all frequently won't operate with Alexa and often also with the Kasa app. Alexa says the device is not responding. If I press the green button, it will start working again and work well until the next day and then stop responding again. I just can't depend on it. Other ""smart"" outlets I have work every time. I don't see others have this problem so I wonder if it's because my outlets are not grounded. I use those three prong to two prong adapters. I don't know if that's the reason and I'm tempted to test them in grounded outlets but that's not where I need them so as they are, they really aren't very useful to me.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Would be perfect if smaller,4.0 ,This is my first WiFi plug and I love it. My only problem with this is that it is used on an outlet that has another device that plugs directly into the wall and is visible. So this is only a few centimeters too large to fit two items. I know I could use socket extender cords but like I said the outlet is visible and that would look ugly in my living room and I am picky about messy looking things. So my advice is to try the other smaller WiFi smart plugs that are smaller if you need an extra outlet slot available. I just ordered another mimic smart plug from another brand that both use the Kasa app to control them. Update I returned this item for the mini version.

Also, small enough where you can easily use both plugs (it doesn't take up a lot of space on the plug) I set one up by plugging into the wall, then plugged a power strip into it... and two lamps into the power strip. Works great. Now all I have to do is say ""Alexa, turn on/off the Living Room"". The App is easy to work with. Just remember if you are setting up areas, or rooms, you have to go back to your Alexa app to do that. Oh, and you can only dim your lights if you have the correct light-bulbs in your fixtures. I'll definitely be getting more of these for other rooms in my home. We are open-concept with a lot of lamps so it sure makes life easier. I'll also be checking out the other TP-Link products, like the light switches.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
We're a TP-Link family!,5.0 ,"These plugs are larger than I expected. Wish they had side outlets, I had to get one of those power strips with side outlets so I could put it behind the couch. Had a problem with the initial set up. Got on the phone with customer service, who stayed on the phone with me for over an hour troubleshooting. We finally gave up while I called my internet provider (who was NO help). Before I packed them up to send back, I tried again. IT WORKED! Only thing I can think of is that my router needed to be rebooted, and I changed my password to be on the safe side. Long story short, customer service is awesome. These plugs are awesome. We bought the TP-Link lightbulb, love that it's dimmable, works great! I have the light switch coming tomorrow!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Tedious set up, with one tricky glitch, but once set up seems to work very well with Alexa",4.0 ,"I just finished up setting up the TP-Link Smart Plug so that it would control a bright sun simulating lamp in my living room using my Amazon Dot and Alexa to control it by voice. Since the set up is very fresh in my mind I thought I'd write a quick review. I will update this review later if I have any problems with the switch. The process is a little bit tedious. First you plug the TP Link Smart plug into an outlet. Then you must go to your android or iOS phone and download the Kasa app. This app is about 30 MB on an android phone. Next you go through a set up procedure which in my case failed the first time because I had entered the wrong Wi-Fi password for my home network which was completely my fault. When I corrected the error the switch connected with my phone. New problem. For some reason the App refused to allow me to set the device for remote control, which is absolutely necessary in order to use Alexa. It kept thinking that I hadn't verified my email, even though I had. Finally, after trying several things unsuccessfully, I logged out of the app, and I logged back in. This fixed the remote control setting problem. Now I was able to go to the Alexa app on my phone, and add the Kasa skill. Next I went to SmartHome section in Alexa app, and ran Discover Devices, and the Alexa app was able to find the TP-Link Switch. I added the Switch to one of my groups, and now Alexa turns on the Daylight light when I say ""Alexa, Turn on Sunlight"". Nice!!! I may end up moving the switch to my coffee maker, so in the morning I can say ""Alexa, turn on Coffee"" in order to make coffee. So in conclusion I gave this four stars because I knocked off one star for the slightly tedious set up. Also, if I hadn't logged out and logged back in, I'm pretty confident that the App never would have allowed me to set the switch for remote control. This should be better documented. We will see how the switch works over time. I've owned previous Wemo smart switches which constantly forgot their programming so I am hoping that this one will be stable over time.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
This is a very smart plug,5.0 ,"I purchased a smart plug a few years ago but this unit is a lot easier to configure and program. I'm using the Kasa software on an Android phone which offers a lot of features. In addition to monitoring runtime history like the model HS100 this unit also monitors power consumption on a real time, daily, weekly, and monthly basis. I'm using this device to control a basement dehumidifier which is not very efficient by itself because it tends to run all the time. I used the power consumption data to determine how long the dehumidifier really needs to operate to lower the humidity and ended up scheduling it to run for an hour at a time every four hours. Not only is the HS110 saving me energy but it should also extend the life of the humidifier by reducing the number of on/off cycles.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Off to a good start,5.0 ,"I have no idea how long these plugs will last but the first couple of weeks have been trouble-free. I am using these with an Amazon Echo via the Kasa software and they work really work together. I tell Echo to turn on the light and the light goes on almost immediately. In fact, the Echo says ""OK"" when you ask it to turn on the light, but the light is already on by the time she says it. The plugs are going to take one outlet space and cover up the other one (in a two-socket plate), but I bought a pack of those short extension cords that Amazon sells and freed the second socket. Home automation is still developing and will be much more reliable in a few years, but this is a pretty good device in terms of current consumer-level products.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
5 star? read on,5.0 ,"Months later review: I've been using these now for a while, in a family of 'power' users, meaning our pg&e bill can get high. With these I can monitor what is running and for how long, and have the option to turn things off if needed (like my fridge). A few handy things for me are: 1) I can track our refrigerator's usage over days/weeks, its not all bad until it turns on the defrost cycle! 2) I've used a few to turn on / off AC grid tie inverters (with battery packs) to mitigate our power usage during high-use times. And I can see the reduction on our rainforest smart meter monitor, confirming the power reading on these smart plugs which is a great feature to have. 3) I like the app, its fairly straightforward, and has triggered power on/off functions which I like. I use that to turn off chargers once they fall below a watt level where they are no longer providing much charge. I've inadvertently had the 'new trigger' turn off when power exceeds ___W, and they would instantly turn back off. I initially thought I had a problem, but the notification told me otherwise, cluing me on my error... Some things I think would be helpful: 1) wifi access but no internet (you know, just in case it goes down LOL) the app can still access the smart plugs if my local wifi network is still alive and my phone is connected to it. (internet hasn't died just yet, but don't want to find out with working wifi, the smart plugs no longer work) 2) work with the Stringify app. Stringify needed a public API to be able to use Etekcity's smart plugs. This makes both a powerful tool when it comes to monitoring things. For example, if my smart meter goes over a preset power setting, I could tell it to turn on/off certain smart plugs. Alexa is nice to have, but its short lived. Alexa doesn't have the same monitoring Vesync has or any app pass-through feature which would allow other apps to use Alexa as a control or host. 3) if #2 is simply impossible, create a new function in the ""new trigger action"" menu to turn on or off other smart outlets in my menu. For example, if outlet 1 power drops below xxx watts, turn on outlet 2. This would allow you to cascade functions to accomplish doing more with them. 4) notifications don't show up on my cell, only within the Vesync app. email works, but it lags by minutes/hours. 5) for some reason, if I'm in a monitor menu and I press the super button to get me back the phone, when I reopen Vesync, there is a different smart plug picture and none of the readings work. Hitting back a few times gets me to the smart plug menu, guessing that's a bug. You might be wondering, why all this? PG&E and deregulation (which hasn't happened). I pay rates 2-3x higher than someone who lives a few miles down the road. Does solar help? sure, but PG&E's payback is a nickel per kWh, and charge you 20c per kWh used and then there's the penalty stage if you go over the baseline which seems to be based on nobody at home from 8-5, m-f. My bill is lower because I can see / manage my power usage better, thanks to Etekcity's smart plugs. Yeah, I've tried Dlink, range is worse, their update bricked one that actually measured power, and their cost is higher. And they were constantly losing connection even in line of sight (50') to wifi. So Etekcity's have better range (I have 4 smart plugs in another garage on my lot), better reliability (yeah i got 3 customer returns -poorly packed was the clue- that I returned, lost some hours I wont get back) but overall, better performance for your money. Pointers: Check the monitor watts menu to see you're within its power rating too. I'm working these fairly good, 2-3x / day up to 1000W for hours at a time, varying locations on my lot and with noisy equipment. So mine are seeing a fair amount of use. Problems with initial connection? Closing the app and restarting helps. I've checked to see how many things were on my network and if it was full, there was no indication that it was... I paid for all my smart plugs, received nothing for this review other than the (replacements for duds) and satisfaction using them. Hope that helps someone deciding to buy or not.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
and get into the app where you can easily register new devices and use them,4.0 ,"It's 20 bucks, it's tiny, and it does what it says. The setup was a breeze, and the app lets you configure schedules, countdowns and just manually turn it on or off whenever. And it works from anywhere. It's almost magical. Oh, and it does seem to track electricity usage, which is neat. However, there are a few things to be aware of: - The android app requires permissions it really shouldn't need (Camera, Phone and Storage access). If you're on a recent enough Android version (6+), you can remove those permissions without seemingly breaking any functionality. - The app asks you to register an account to use it, and requires you to receive an email with a validation code to do so, but the email never came, despite repeated attempts. However, you can ""skip"" the account login part, face some vaguely dire-ish warning for doing so, and get into the app where you can easily register new devices and use them. - The whole package is made in China. The hardware, the firmware on the hardware, and the app. The app will send analytics to taobao.com, logs to umeng.com, etc. If you happen to browse the Settings->Feeback section of the app, you will be treated to a few seconds of chinese text before the english version loads. - The hardware comes with a seemingly unlimited free subscription to a cloud service that mediates every operation. It maintains a constant websocket connection with one of two linode-hosted servers, from which it gets its instructions. This is how the mobile apps are able to operate the device from anywhere. This is great, up until the servers go away, and all those devices transform into pumpkins. This is a common situation with many IoT devices, but it bears to be repeated. Or maybe said once, since none of this product's descriptions mention this. Which brings me to my current thought about this gizmo: - the aforementioned websocket connection is not encrypted. A boot time, the device uses DHCP nicely, then resolves a hostname and proceeds to establish a websocket connection. From there, various bits of mostly self-documenting JSON fly back and forth to perform various functions. - it is very likely possible to design a little websocket proxy that would put itself in between the device and its cloud, assuming the DNS server your DHCP server the device talks to is willing to point it at your proxy (custom router software like dd-wrt or tomato would be a great way to do that) - at that point, it's not terribly hard to imagine short-circuiting their cloud service altogether. Or adding support for some IFTTT custom action. In short, I strongly suspect this device can be hacked into being part of something greater than itself, although it seems like it may require having a little server sitting somewhere and being able/willing to tweak your LAN DNS configuration in slightly unusual ways.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Stopped working less than a day,2.0 ,"I was very excited to use this for my salon to schedule my appliances to turn off and on. This would eliminate the risk of fire if left on overnight. The app is awesome and it's very easy to set your schedule and power on/off. The problem is after only a few hours, it stopped working. The light was on and the app showed it as powered on, but it would not feed power to the appliance.

"Excellent WiFi Smart Plugs, would definitely buy again!",5.0 ,"Great product. worked like a charm. Downloaded the app, plugged in the devices and they immediately acquired the WiFi signal. Now, they turn on my coffee pot and toaster. One caveat regarding the toaster! I tried to use it with my four toaster unit and it caused a problem. It says that it's good up to 1200 watts, so perhaps using both sides at once was too much wattage. Now I just use one side of the toaster at a time.

Great Product!,5.0 ,"We were needing something that we could set our lamps to a schedule since we went away on the weekends a lot. I found this product through amazon, never have heard anything about it & thought i would give it a try. I am so glad we found this product it has worked great & we love that we can control it through our phone, as well as get notifications about when it turns on & off. It is also nice to be able to sit on the couch & just pull out your phone to turn the lamp on instead of having to get up & turn it on manually. It is designed so perfectly where you can still use both outlets while this is plugged in. So far we have bought 2 & will probably end up buying more. Hoping that it will connect with Google Home eventually.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Great features,5.0 ,"I own this product and the TP-Link HS100. Since both are very similar products at the same price point (the TP-Link is a few dollars more), I'll be comparing them. Design: The Etekcity unit is much more compact. The TP-Link blocks both outlets, whether it's on the top or the bottom (see photos). Etekcity will only block the bottom outlet if it's in the top. The LEDs are more subtle on the Etekcity. the power button is much smaller and deliberately blended in on Etekcity, which is worse if you're planning to use it a lot. For me it doesn't matter. Hardware Features/Limitations: The Etekcity measures power and voltage passing through the plug and logs it. This is a huge plus that the TP-Link does not have. I didn't do a terribly scientific test, but it showed 580W with my space heater set to 600W, and it showed the voltage drooping from 119V to 117V with the heater on. It showed 850W with my heater in 900W mode. The Etekcity is limited to 10A passing through it (per label; I don't try to exceed the label), which is 1200W. This should be fine for 95% of electrical devices (my built-in microwave is 1100W). However, it doesn't allow a 1500W (12.5A) space heater set to maximum, or an electric car charger (mine claims a max of 12A). I do consider this a downside since I was excited to swap the TP-Link (which supports 15A) out for the car charger control to get the power logging. First-party apps: Both first party apps (Etekcity VesyncOutlet and TP-Link Kasa) are similar. They both prompt to set up an online account but let you easily skip it (I prefer to keep my smart devices contained in the house). VesyncOutlet obviously has the additional power logging features which seem intuitive. Both allow easy control with schedules and timers. The Etekcity was quicker to set up since the TP-Link you have to connect via WiFi to the outlet for setup, but Etekcity appears to do it over Bluetooth, so it was much more seamless. Integration: The Kasa app for TP-Link let's you link to Alexa if you go the online account route. I did not test this. Etekcity VesyncOutlet does not claim compatibility with any integration services. Neither is currently supported by Logitech Harmony Home Control, which is what I would prefer. I would encourage both vendors to work with Logitech on this. Bottom line: If you need more than 1200W or Alexa and the outlet crowding isn't a concern, go with the TP-Link. Otherwise, the smaller design and power monitoring make the Etekcity a superior product. The fact that it's slightly cheaper (47 vs 50 for a two pack as of writing) is just a small bonus.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

would be *much* happier if Etekcity added support for IFTTT actions,3.0 ,"Product seems decent. works as advertised. A few pieces of constructive feedback: (1) As several other users have already pointed out, would be *much* happier if Etekcity added support for IFTTT actions. Competing products offer this and Etekcity should also offer this integration to remain competitive. Alexa integration is nice but IFTTT does not support Alexa actions, only Alexa triggers, so this doesn't help in my case. (2) The triggers within the app are a little too simplistic. It would be nice if a single trigger could induce not just an OFF event but an OFF followed by a several second delay, followed by an ON event (aka ""power cycle"") If either of these issues is addressed, I would definitely revise my review upward.

Love these!!,5.0 ,"I had initially purchased two TP-Link smart plugs. One was defective. Additionally, they were a bit tricky to install. So I got back on Amazon and read the reviews.

Great programmable lighting and electrical plugs.,5.0 ,"Waited to hook up all four and watch for a few days and so, great! App for IOS is easy as can be. I need to experiment and see what happens in a power loss before we go away. A question was emailed me by Amazon before these arrived. CAN THEY FIT WITH ANOTHER PLUG? I ordered these because they appeared to allow room for the other outlet. This turned out to be true, only a larger head plug like the angled ones on some surge protectors do not allow both to fit. Anyway, I'll update this if plugs fail but so far they look like an excellent investment. Don't try to read the skimpy instructions, just scan the code with the phones you want to program and it's pretty intuitive (for iPhone, at least) from there. the program looks like it can consolidate smart feature programming and makes it easy to review current schedules by day of week.",Wifi Smart Plug Set of 2 Mini Smart Outlet Works with Amazon Alexa Remote Control By Smart Phone from Anywhere Anytime (2 Packs)

Once you assign a name for each plug, works seamlessly with Alexa. And for less than 30 bucks for two, seems like a bargain compared to the other branded ones.

Great smart plugs at a great price,4.0 ,"I'm giving a pretty high review because I easily set up both of these using the default approach, and the price is good for the feature set. I downloaded the Smart Life app on iOS, created an account (yes, it requires your phone number...I'm not too troubled by that). I had one problem giving my full Wifi SSID password, it was too long to enter into the Smart Life app on iOS. So I attached these to my guest network which has a shorter password (and probably a good idea anyway). If not for this one problem I might give a 5-star review. There was also a backup connection approach which makes these their own temporary WiFi AP (a lot of devices do this as an alternative connection means). I did not need to use that, as the ""plan A"" approach worked fine for me. I renamed each of these to a good straightforward name and enabled the Alexa Smart Life smart home skill, and discovered the devices. All of this worked flawlessly and I can use the app or Alexa to control these. The Smart Life skill also supports IFTTT for the more advanced home automation tinkerers. My only concern, I guess, is that these require a cloud platform to stay running for them to continue to work - and that means ongoing costs. If the company ever decides to shut this down, these no longer function. Although made in China my two units both connect to EC2 instances in US-West-2 on the MQTT port. You can easily check this by checking your local router to find the assigned IP, then search in the list of open ports what target IP and port they connect to, and then run a ""whois"" to find ownership of the related IP block. Anyway, I'm counting on these staying operative but I guess there is no guarantee.",Wifi Smart Plug Set of 2 Mini Smart Outlet Works with Amazon Alexa Remote Control By Smart Phone from Anywhere Anytime (2 Packs)
Flawed.,3.0 ,"Set up was very simple. -1star for requiring you to set up an additional app. -1 star for not allowing you to utilize the switch as well. I wanted to use this for our bedroom lights (lamps) which plug in to an outlet controlled by a switch. I understand that the unit obviously couldn't work if the switch is off, but I'd like to be able to come into the room and flip the switch to turn them on. Instead when you flip the switch the lights stay off, then you have to wait about 10 seconds and ask Alexa to turn on the lights. Kind of obnoxious. I wanted to be able to flip them on with the switch, then after rading in bed or something be able to turn them off via voice control. The base setting on this outlet when it receives power is ""off"", whereas if it we're ""on"" or setting adjustable this unit would be great.",Wifi Smart Plug Set of 2 Mini Smart Outlet Works with Amazon Alexa Remote Control By Smart Phone from Anywhere Anytime (2 Packs)
Works great,5.0 ,"Paired up easily. Set up a schedule to control some lamps, no additional fees or purchases. Work's with Alexa. Only drawback is you're adding two more devices to your router.

Unreliable,3.0 ,"I've bought two of these things now, different brands, different sellers, but they appear to be identical, with identical packaging, appearance, the same horribly translated user guide and basically the same performance. Made in China, natch. So why the three stars? Because I'm feeling generous today, that's why. These things are difficult to setup the first time, largely because of the unhelpful instructions. However, once you get past that, you can get your Echo to learn the new skill (easy) and control it from your phone or Echo. Google home is not supported. It works great until it stops working. I've had both units stop responding. I don't know why. Sometimes you have to reset them and relearn them, other times if you just wait a few minutes they'll restore themselves. This does not fall into the ""reliable"" or ""dependable"" category. For what they cost, you can be assured that only the cheapest, least expensive commodity components are included, and so the quality appears to be rather sub-par. I like to save money, but I would gladly spend twice as much if I could get a unit that would work consistently and reliably. I guess the lesson here is, don't put the unit where it's difficult to get to (which is really the point of having a remotely controlled outlet...) because you will likely have to get to it to reset it. Again and again.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, No Hub required, FCC and ETL listed, Easy installation and App control like a Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (1-Pack)"

It makes me satisfied. Recommended,5.0 ,"Two weeks ago I bought this smart plug, Because I will leave home after a few days.

Advantages: I can use my smartphone to control the Smart Plug anytime, anywhere, and I can turn on the light before arriving home, so I will not see a dark house. I'd love to leave the pattern, I can set a time interval, during which time I can open and close the fixture at any time to improve the security. I often go out, so it is really great for me. I can use my cloud camera, and it would be easy to see my house condition.
