Works As Advertised!,5.0 ,"Wanted something we could use from our phones regardless if we are home or not! This is it! Scheduling can be confusing, but easy once figured out.

Google Home instructions,3.0 ,"Thought I would give it 3 stars as nobody else had. I just got it today so hard to give it more. But I wanted to share two things. First, for Google Home, the included instructions don't say anything but the printed ones here in Amazon give the missing needed information and that is that you select ""Smart Life"" from the choices. Read the ones in tiny small print that is one of the pictures of the device. Use the hover magnify to read it. But the only really missing thing is to go into Google Home and add the device with the name Smart Life. Then you have to give them the email and password you used in setting up their app. So remember it!. Surprise when adding the second smart plug. Smart Life no longer showed up so I deleted the connection by touching the Smart Life icon then added it again. I was then able to add both devices. It would be nice if they said that in the instructions. Also, the USB power is always on, it does not switch.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Assistant, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, No Hub Required Easy Connection With Amazon Echo Google Home(3 PACK)"
smart living 👍🏻👍🏻,5.0 ,"I’m a big fan of smart living, been using wemo smart plugs and i really love the convenience. But i been very annoy that wemo smart plug is fairly large and sometime (depends how your outlet set up) it might take up both of my outlet space so I decided to get the mini size one. while browsing for info about wemo mini, this 3 pack deal comes into my search and the price caught my eye; this dailycomb smart plugs only cost less than 1/2 of the wemo mini so i decide to give it a try since everyone tried to use this kind of smart plug will know, you will not just get one and just use the only one ;) so instead of spending over $100 for 3, so i went with it. **been using the plugs for about 3 weeks, they are steady and i found the operation of these plugs are actually MUCH easier than Wemo cause the wifi setup for wemo sometime is real pain; for this one you just need to follow the instruction (have clear english instruction, i believe is not google translate), download the app, hook up wifi and they are good to go! like it has extra usb so i can charge my devices while using it, only downside about these plugs are the plastic feels pretty thin, unlike wemo they do feel study. but this doesn’t effect the basic function of the plugs**","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Assistant, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, No Hub Required Easy Connection With Amazon Echo Google Home(3 PACK)"
"So far, I love it",5.0 ,"These plugs were a dream to install. I don't use the phone app much except to install them, and use them primarily with Alexa. On the phone app, you need to install the Smart Life app whether on IOS or Android. You also need to enable the Smart Life skill on Alexa if you are using Alexa to control the devices on the plugs. After that, is is really all self explanatory. You don't need to read the tiny print on the instructions. I had initially tried the Leviton DW3HL-1BW Decora Smart Wi-Fi Plug-in Dimmer, No Hub Required, Works with Amazon Alexa & Google Assistant that was a pain in the neck from the get-go. That plug disconnected at least twice a day that required reconfiguring. When it did connect to Alexa it took 1-2 minutes for commands to be implemented. Also, with the Leviton plug, you have to enter the WIFI security code for each plug installed. I have returned all of the Leviton plugs. This smart plug is a dream to install. Once you enter the WIFI security code,you don't have to enter it again for additional plugs installed. Alexa response to commands is instantaneous.I have not yet had a problem with the plug disconnecting, but will update my review if I do. So far, I couldn't be happier with this smart plug.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Assistant, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, No Hub Required Easy Connection With Amazon Echo Google Home(3 PACK)"
"Control wirelessly, easy setup",5.0 ,"Bought this for controlling my room lamp, it works really well i am able to control my lamp anywhere on the earth as long as there is wireless connection on my cellphone. One thing, I like the most about this device compare to the others is that this device has an extra usb plug which you can plug your cellphone cable in. I think this is definitely a plus to the device. Setup was pretty easy, I installed ios smart life on my phone and i am able to add my plug device into the app without any issue. Pretty good deal for a pack of three devices at a time. Recommended for people just started to play smart devices at home.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Assistant, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, No Hub Required Easy Connection With Amazon Echo Google Home(3 PACK)"
Works...but emits a high-pitched noise?,3.0 ,"Worked really well and the timer option from the Smart Life app was very nice. I also liked the option of having a USB connection on the side. However, I used 2 out of the 3 and they both emitted a high-pitched noise when it is ""off"" and the red light is on. It sounded kind of electrical? The seller, Dailycomb, was very easy to work with. They offered to send me replacements without mailing the original back, but I just don't feel it was safe with the noise. 2/3 of them did that...fair chance the replacements would do the same. Decided to return them, and was refunded in full without any issues.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Assistant, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, No Hub Required Easy Connection With Amazon Echo Google Home(3 PACK)"
Nice smart plugs,5.0 ,"I really like the idea of smart plug. I have one want. It works great but the size is too big. It took away two outlet spaces. And it's a little pricy. I looked specifically for smartplugs with rectangular shape which won't block other outlets when plugs in. This is the one I want. A pack of three really give me control on multiple devices. The app is easy to set up and control different devices well. My only complaint is the prints on the instruction manual is so tiny. Basically, the app needed is called BrightFun. I just downloaded from app store and follow the instruction in the app and it's ready to go. No need to read the tiny prints.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Assistant, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, No Hub Required Easy Connection With Amazon Echo Google Home(3 PACK)"
Reliable Product and Works Great With Alexa,5.0 ,"After becoming completely disgusted with the WEMO devices I purchased working reliability, I tried the Smart Plug to make it possible to turn my lamps on/off using my voice and my Alexa Echo Dot. They worked great and were easy to enable using the app I downloaded. They have worked reliably every since. I really didn't need the USB charge port where I have my lamps plugged in, but it may turn out to be convenient. Because they have worked so reliably, I'll probably get some light switches from this same company.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Assistant, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, No Hub Required Easy Connection With Amazon Echo Google Home(3 PACK)"
Don't use the Brightfun App!,4.0 ,"The instructions say to use the Brightfun App, but it wouldn't connect to my Alexa/ Echo Dot. The Smart life app works just fine. you don't need the other!

Setup is very easy and they work flawlessly so far,5.0 ,"Bought these Wi-Fi Plug Outlet to pair with Amazon Echo. Setup is very easy and they work flawlessly so far. My lamp is not near my bed, I'm now able to turn the the lamp on and off without getting out of bed. I just tell Alexa to do it.

takes time but works,5.0 ,"spent a good amount on it. It turned out to be working nicely which means everything . The pic in the instruction is somewhat miss-leading. The app name is BrightFun not that Chinese characters. It did not work for me at the begining since the device is showed offline. Some lesson learnt here: although it may say not connect successfully, the devise still show up in the app. This will not working while u try to connect to the Alexa. Only when it is successfully linked to the smartlife app, Alexa will work. Otherwise, Alexa will accept yr commend but do nothing.","Smart Plug, Works With Alexa & Google Assistant, USB Charger (5V 2.1A), DAILYCOMB Wi-Fi Mini Smart Outlet With Timing Function, No Hub Required Easy Connection With Amazon Echo Google Home(3 PACK)"
Quality smart plugs,5.0 ,"The 3 pack smart plugs come in a box with 3 individually packaged plugs, which you can keep all for yourself or give a few away as a present. I used a smart plug to control my WiFi bulb, and connected the plug with my echo dot through Alexa. Now the WiFi is off when the family is sleeping; I suppose it is good for your health.

"Frustrating, and after a lot of headache some outlets just flake out after several hours.",1.0 ,"App did nothing. Could not come figure or connect outlets to WiFi. After 45 mins, I gave up. Reviews on Google Play Store all said the same thing as well, that it does not work. UPDATE: I realized after the fact that there are MULTIPLE apps with the same name - your instructions say to download the app called ""Smart Life"" - of which there are three - and I select the wrong one (The one you want is actually called ""Smart Life - Smart Living""). After getting the correct app, I was able to get the outlets set up, but some of them are having issues where they stop responding after several hours - including even the physical button on the device (pressing it does nothing; the device is frozen in the on or off state). The only way to get it to work again it to unplug and replug it. After several hours again, same result. I have tried resetting the devices and re configuring them - no change in result. I have checked the signal level to the devices (moderately strong, >-65dB) as well. I am out of ideas for what is wrong, so I will be returning the outlets. It kind of defeats the concept if I have to constantly go around the house to unplug things to reset the outlets so I can control them with other devices.","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, 15A Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/IOS)"
I love this WiFi smart socket,5.0 ,"I love this WiFi smart socket. I have used other WiFi smart sockets before but what's nice about this one is the design of it.

I'm impressed with the quality of these wall sockets. Does not feel cheap.

outstanding technology,5.0 ,"I absolutely love these! They arrived neatly packaged and early along with a beautifully printed business card. The instructions were as clear as day as to how to set the electrical sockets up. It took me about 2 minutes to set up with the app. That was mostly just registering an account and setting up to alexa. It works with your smart phone at the tap of a button, or with alexa app. We have an amazon echo in our home, it works with that as well. Make sure to name each socket differently to not confuse yourself. I added a short clip of the echo paired with the outlet in action.","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, 15A Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/IOS)"

"Good overall, can still be improved",4.0 ,"The packaging is very nice-looking, as well as the plug itself. The plug works as described, if installed properly. It enables me to close the light in the bedroom with just one-click on the phone. Sometimes I still forget about the app and will want to manually open / close it with its own switch but I just can't :'( Just need to get used to it if remote control is something you want. That being said, the pairing stage could be really annoying. For me, one of the plug works perfectly and another sucks, I tried over 5 times with different instructions from the manufacturer, still didn't work out.

Note that you can still manually switch this outlet on and off, just need to press on its green/blue indicating light on the side. The other comment probably didn't know this.

"So far so good, with a few bonus features",3.0 ,"UPDATE 11/17: I have started experiencing the WiFi drop-off others have mentioned. My network is very reliable and none of my computers or devices have any problem, yet these plugs frequently need unplugged and plugged back in before being ""online"". Kind of defeats the purpose of having a smart wireless plug. Will be reaching out to the seller/Amazon to rectify, not interested in keeping them if they don't work properly. Just received and setup today, they seem to be good quality so I don't anticipate needing to revise for failure. Packaged nicely, 2 plugs for $30 is a great deal. My other smart plug was more than that for just one and the only added function it has is energy tracking and monitoring - who cares! Setup in app was easy, just make sure you download the correct one, check the screenshots in the instructions provided to be sure. Enabling and linking in the Alexa app was a breeze, both were up and running in minutes. One thing that was annoying is during setup if you enter the wrong wifi password the app will not notify you, it will still go through the syncing process and then display ""failure"" but not tell you why. So if you're having connection issues initially, check your typing! Aside from that, the app is great. Has scheduling and timing abilities, including a random setting, which is great for use during vacationing away from home. You can also set up condition-dependent schedules, like turning on a light at sunrise and not have to worry about adjusting the time throughout the year. Very cool features I hadn't before though about! Again, short of one of them failing, I see no reason why I can't give 5 stars.","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, 15A Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/IOS)"

$30 for two is as good as a deal you can get,5.0 ,"Simple and straightforward. It just works after a few steps as instructed. $30 for two is as good as a deal you can get. Remembered I spent 39.99 for an Apple Home product before and I deeply regretted it when I saw this deal. Note that this thing occupies two sockets' width, so if your sockets are horizontally aligned it may block other sockets, but it works great otherwise.","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, 15A Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/IOS)"

The setup was easy and straight forward,2.0 ,"Initially bought two (2 Pack) of the OMoton Model # W-US002 ASIN:B0746G946P for my home in August. The setup was easy and straight forward. In less than a week one stopped working altogether. You could use the button to turn it on and off, but that was it. Contacted seller and they offered me a code that if I bought one, one was free. I agreed and received those around Sept 8, 2017. Sometime around Nov. 10,2017 the one for our living room was randomly turning itself off and on. I switched that one with one we do not use very much in the guest room. Now, just today the one in our sun-room has done the same thing as the first one. It will not connect, I tried all listed ways of fixing this thing. So the initial order of 4(one was bad) plus the additional 2 should have left me with 5 working. As of today I have three that work the way they should, one that randomly turns on and off, and one that just died. 3 out of 6 is not a good percentage in my book...","OMOTON [2 Pack] Mini Wifi Smart Plug Works with Amazon Alexa,Google Home, IFTTT, 15A Wireless Socket Outlet Remotely Controls your Devices from anywhere,No Hub Required(Android/IOS)"

It works great but directions are extra frustrating.,4.0 ,"Product works great, but the directions that come with it are abysmal. Manufacturer, please redo your directions, they are complete garbage. This does connect to Alexa, directions to follow. For those of you as frustrated as I was, light your directions included in the product on fire and use these: 1.) download the ""Smart Life"" app. 2.) install your plugs on the app. To do so, you will require your wifi passcode. I used the manual setup (AP Mode), as ""magic"" was a joke. Manually set up your plug according to the instructions on the app. To get to AP mode, there is a button on the top right of the app that says ""AP"". Click that and follow prompts, but it works just like when you set up echo dot in that you have to set your phone to your wifi, then to the device wifi to recognize it. This was by far the easier set up. 3.) open Alexa app. Go to ""smart home"". Go to ""add skills"". Search ""smart life"". Click ""enable skills"" 4.) still in Alexa, go to devices. Click ""discover devices"". Your previously loaded plug or plugs from smart life should populate. Add to Alexa. 5.) you can now voice control devices. Should you want to control several at once (Alexa, turn on living room lights) then create a group within Alexa and add the individual devices to that group. Eureka. Done.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Giving 5 stars but setup had issues, works well after",5.0 ,"It was admittedly frustrating to connect it at first because the app has issues.. I got a connection error over and over until I switched to AP mode (took at least 10 attempts), made further frustrating by the fact that I have dual-band wifi and use the 5ghz because the 2.4ghz mode that this product uses is very congested. But once I got it going I was really impressed with the power monitoring feature.. it is incredibly sensitive and accurate! I tested a lot of appliances out of curiosity, it was able to detect changes in energy consumption to the tenth of a watt and by a milliamp. Setting up Alexa was pretty easy although the app didn't provide this feature so I had to do it manually. Also would be nice if it supported 5ghz wifi and third-party interaction like Apple's smart home.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Fast response time, excellent app, and solid integration with Google Home and Echo = WIN",5.0 ,"The instructions are pretty hard to follow, but the crazy thing is that the device is super easy to set up on Android using the KMC Smart app. In fact, just toss the directions, download the app and muddle your way through it. Also, it is ridiculously easy to set up voice control with Amazon Echo using the KMC Smart smart home skill. But the easiest by far is setting it up on Google Home ... the only trick there is that you use the ""Smart Life"" service. And the thing that I love the most about this little switch is how fast it is. Make the voice command or hit the button on your phone and it will turn the plug on or off within 1 second. Really impressive response time! Now I can remotely control the power to a device I keep in a corner of the garage.

"Connects easily, works great",5.0 ,"I have a ton of wifi Alexa connectable smart plugs but this is my first KMC and sofar i like it. It uses the same app as another of my plugs so that's extra nice as I don't need as many random smart home apps on my phone. Connecting was easy and it turns on as soon as you 0ress the button in the app. It also has timer functions and a few other app features.

Good smart device.,4.0 ,"This device is very sleek and doesn't look bulky. The reason for the 4 stars is because it took two days to get it set up to where it would work on my echo. It took 1 day to get it paired to my phone and the next day to get it to work on my echo. This also may have been the fault of the operator. I do have it connected now so the next one I buy I shouldn't have any trouble. The price is half of others that I have priced, so it is worth the money even if it took me a little more time.

Couldn't figure out a way to set this up without downloading the app and creating an account with KMC, but once it's setup and you hook it to Alexa (or Google Home) you can delete the app and pretend it never happened. As others noted the App requests far more permissions than it should, but use a junk phone if you are concerned. This deserves a 5-star considering the price and function, if they can eliminate the account creation and minimize the app permissions.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"

Voice control for Google Home,5.0 ,"When I first received my devices (I ordered 2) I was excited. After getting them hooked up to my 2.4 GHZ network they would work in the app just perfect. That being said I really wanted them to integrate with my Google Home. After multiple attempts and frustration, I finally responded to the seller based on feedback form other post.

The seller admitted to needing to get back to me with some additional details and they responded the next day with the notes below. After looking at the initial notes I thought this was the same process I had seen all over the web, but alas, step 14 was key.

This is done by asking the Google Assistant app on your phone, ""OK Google talk to Smart Life."" then you are promoted to log in. Then do the same for Google Home, ""OK Google talk to smart life."" Google then brings in the Smart Life voice and ask what she can do for you. Attached is a video of me turning off and on my office lamp.

Setup is fairly easy but not as clear as the seller indicates so let me help those that need it: This works with an app called ""KMC Smart"" in the App store for the iPhone (I can't confirm if it is the same name for Android). There is a QR code in the instructions that will find the app for you. Download the app, register for an account and you are ready to start. Insert the Smart Plug into an outlet. In the app, click on add a device. Press the button on the Smart Plug to make it flash (as the app tells you) and press next in the app. (Note that sometimes I had trouble getting it to flash but was always successful by retrying and/or unplugging and plugging back in. Once setup, it is not an issue.) Enter your Wi-Fi and password in the app and press next. If everything is entered correctly, it should find your plug and show the name. You can rename the device at this time to something that makes sense for you. Click done in the app. You can now turn outlet on and off from the app. Add more devices the same way. If you want to add your smart plugs to Amazon Echo: Open your Alexa App and select skills from the menu. Search for ""Smart Life"" (by tuna technology) and enable. Enter the same account information you entered for the ""KMC Smart"" app. Now from the Alexa App menu open Smart Home (you should see ""Smart Life"" as one of your skills. Click on ""Discover Devices"" and all the smart plugs that you added in the ""KMC Smart"" app will be found by Alexa. You can now ask you Amazon Echo to turn on/off your smart plugs by name. I setup everything and writing the review the same night so I can't speak to the reliability of the product yet. If something changes, I will update my review.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"

Easy setup and works well,5.0 ,"This is a pretty standard WiFi enabled smart outlet that is easy to setup and works great. I did not end up looking at the directions because it worked perfectly the first time with the smart app (TuyaSmart) that I have been using for my other smart devices. Setup was as easy as making sure the led was flashing (it already was when I plugged it in the first time), clicking on the add device option in the Tuya app and selecting Electrical outlet. There was a spinner for 20 seconds or so and then I added the outlet and I could control it through either the button on the front or through the smart phone app. The app also lets you set up schedules as well as hook it up to Amazon Alexa or Google Home (although I haven't tried either of these). This smart plug uses the very common ESP8266 platform to enable WiFi connectivity, which also means it is re-programmable for people with some DIY electronics experience. But that is definitely not required to use this device for what it was meant for.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"

"Would be a great product, but the specs are only provided on Amazon",4.0 ,"I am trying different kind of brands of smart outlets to find the best one I want to use long term for all the outlets I want to control with my phone. I bought this brand since I didn't know it and the price range looked good. I came across it since its wattage is in the better range and the product states ""Max load: 10A , 2400W"". This means that every (average) space heater should work fine with it since they are usually 1500W max. The installation isn't different to the other smart plugs I bought in the past: download the app, create an account (so you can control it when you are not at home), add the device, provide wifi information. Nicely streamlined and not complicated. While this device is bigger as the other ones I have, it doesn't block the second out. That's really positive. It also comes with a timer settings which I haven't seen in all other devices I tested. Usage that come in mind here is to turn on an oil based space heater in winter before I come home as well as Christmas lights. That's another positive factor. The app also shows you the energy consumption of the plugged in device and it also shows you the consumption for the entire month. While I haven't checked it's accuracy, I expect to be in the average range of +/- 1W which doesn't make a big difference in the energy bill. I also really like this feature with smart outlets and not every one I tested had this feature. Now the negative side. When I plugged in this outlet I heard a high feeping noise. A noise you maybe know from other devices. A lot of people can't hear it, especially if older, but somehow I can still hear it and find it annoying. It isn't too loud but I don't want to have the outlet next to the couch due of that. Maybe it's a bad product batch, maybe not. Another negative factor is the provided specification. While the Amazon product page states ""Max load: 10A , 2400W"", the manual as well as the device itself does not talk about any max load information. I only found this information on the Amazon product page. That's actually a deal breaker for future purchases for me. Amazon product description don't have to be accurate and while you can trust it I always double check such values that can make have a big impact. If there is a type, let's say 240W instead of 2400W or 1400W instead of 2400W, then this can be dangerous if you plug in a 1500W device. As result I will use this device only with Christmas lights and not a space heater. I never heard about this company. And while I doubt they will go out of business you want to be aware that you trust the functionality on a company that can shut down their server any day. This is a risk with _every_ single company that creates smart devices that work through the internet. Even big and successful companies like Nest shut down services that made devices to bricks. This is how _every_ smart product works these days and you should be aware of the risk. This can even happen to your $250 thermostat. Just for the full disclosure.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
It makes my life easier,5.0 ,"I purchased a smart plug a few years ago but this unit is a lot easier to configure and program. I'm using the KMC Smart software on an Android phone which offers a lot of features. In addition to monitoring runtime history like the model KMC70011 this unit also monitors power consumption on a real time, daily, weekly, and monthly basis. I'm using this device to control a basement dehumidifier which is not very efficient by itself because it tends to run all the time. I used the power consumption data to determine how long the dehumidifier really needs to operate to lower the humidity and ended up scheduling it to run for an hour at a time every four hours. Not only is the KMC70011 saving me energy but it should also extend the life of the humidifier by reducing the number of on/off cycles.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"

GOOD,5.0 ,"This is the first ""smart plug"" device I have purchased. We have several switches on timers and an older automated lighting system in the house, but I wanted to control some string lights in the porch and since there wasn't an outlet there we looked for alternatives. Initially we had tried one of those inexpensive remote control outlets. It worked OK for a while, but at times the remote would be unresponsive. At other times the lights would come on or shut off by themselves. We started wondering if perhaps a neighbor had the same type of switch and our signals were interfering. Enter the KMC Smart Plug. This is ideal because it only covers one of the receptacles which allows us to continue using the other one. We utilize a few of the Amazon Echo devices in the house so integrating with Alexa was a must. Setup was easy. I downloaded the Smartlife app on my phone, walked through the simple instructions, linked it to Alexa via the Echo app... and done. Setup took maybe three minutes and it worked perfectly the first time and every time since. There are no batteries needed, and no other devices (hubs or other hardware) so all you need is the one Smart Plug, a smartphone or tablet, and wifi. In fact even if you didn't have wifi you could still control this from a smartphone but you would have to connect to the wifi in the plug itself. Now we can simply ask Alexa to turn the lights on or off and the response time is practically instantaneous. I thought there might be a lag of a second or two when using Alexa but that hasn't been the case. I can also use my phone to turn the lights on or off (or any device where you have the app installed), or I can set different timers or various scenes if I really want to. However, for our purposes a simple on or off is all we need. Also, the unit does have a button on the side so you can turn the lights on or off manually - but we have the plug buried behind a cabinet so we won't be using that feature. This is really about as simple as automated lighting can get. I'm very happy and eventually I can see installing some of the hard wired switches in various rooms to allow us even more control over lighting and the ability to ask Alexa to shut off the lights downstairs since asking the kids doesn't seem to work nearly as well. Based upon my experience I'll most likely continue going back to KMC for our other smart devices since the app is so easy to use and having multiple devices together in one app allows custom scenes and things like vacation mode etc.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
what a great little switch.,5.0 ,"a little surprised perhaps, but thus far this smart device deserves all the 5 star reviews. easy to setup with pretty easy to understand instructions, tiny type font and all. all you have to do is scan the qr code to download the application. add the plug to your network, find the geeni skill in the app store and install it to your phone or ipad, then tell alexa to add the geeni skill. not quite a no-brainer but close enough edit: had bought 3 switches, review above is for two i had set up. they worked fine and still do. when i tried to add the third switch to the network it failed to function. green light flashed on/off for a minute or so, then nothing. even tried plugging a lamp into it and turning on and off with the manual switch. never worked. noticed rattle when shaken. returning for free to amazon and buying a new one. costs 46 cents more.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
Inexpensive Alexa enabled wifi smart plug!,5.0 ,"I've been getting more into smart home devices since getting my amazon echo dot earlier this year and I got this KMC smart plug to go along with my smart home setup. It only took me about 3 minutes to get the KMC app downloaded on my iphone and to get the smart plug connected to my home wifi and receiving commands from Alexa. Once you get the smart plug connected to your wifi you enable the KMC skill within your Alexa app and let it discover your new device. I named mine ""diffuser"" just as an example because i had my daughter's alien diffuser plugged into it for the video demonstration. Alexa is able to turn this plug on and off just by saying ""alexa turn diffuser on"" or ""Alexa turn diffuser off"" of course you'll name yours whatever you like. This is a great tool to automate lamps, or coffee makers or anything else that has an always on position. Just leave that device in the on position and tell Alexa to turn this plug on or off.

Couldn't get it to work with Alexa at first.(updated title & review),4.0 ,"The product works as advertised with the KMC and Smart Life apps (I tried both).

Great Device!,5.0 ,"Well, I must admit I have had this device for about three weeks, and I have been wanting to review it for about as long because it is so freaking incredible!!! Sadly, I have had to continue to defer it due to a big wedding we had to attend for our daughter (distraction-LOL), and my need to get ‘caught up’ on my work load. But now fall is setting in, the wedding is over (yes it was awesome) and now I am caught up with work. So her comes the review!!! First of all, if you do not have plans to make you existing home a ‘smart home,’ you probably don’t need to read this review. The reason is because this item is part of a growing market of ‘smart home devices,’ which are guaranteed to make your life a little easier, your utility bills a little lower, and your safety level a lot higher. How do it do that??? Let me tell you in a quick paragraph… The idea of a ‘smart-home’ has actually been around for a while. It actually predates the 1950’s, and if you are in my age group, you will remember (fondly) the cartoon entitled, “The Jetsons.” I don’t know about you, but when I was 12 and was watching “The Jetsons,” I hoped and prayed that I would someday be able to live in that world!!! Well, like it, love it or not, the dawning of that era is upon us, and that is why I love the whole idea of a ‘smart home,’ a home where many of the tasks you need to do are done routinely or by your request. This is where the KMC smart plug comes in, as part of this ‘BIG picture.’ It is a digitally automated device that essentially serves as a ‘buffer’ between you and your electronic, plug-in device. It very simply plugs into your outlet; that’s all there is to it. After you go through the simple set up, that device plugged in will turn on or off at your command, whether you are in the house or not. You are also able to set up a digitally automated schedule, where whatever you plug into it will go off and on at your desire-with you being easily able to readjust the schedule to your changing needs. Here are a few simple examples of how you can use this device: You have a lamp near the front window of your house. You plug said lamp into this plug-you can turn it ‘on’ just before entering your house, or off if you left it on after you left your house to save energy. If you are going to be out late and left it off, perhaps turning it on from your friend’s house would give the appearance of someone being home, when they (you) are not. Don’t be sad about playing tricks on burglars; they rarely feel bad after taking what is not theirs-like your valuables (they have no sense of remorse)!!! Example #2: You plug in your Christmas lights (outdoor or indoor) into this device. You can digitally program this device to go off and on from your phone. Let’s say you want to turn it on early, or keep it on late; you can do both either using voice commands ‘in-house’ with Alexa, or ‘out-of-house’ using your phone. Again, it will save you energy and can give the appearance of someone being home when you are off having a glass of wine at your favorite restaurant. Example #3: Let’s say you have outdoor music and entertainment, like we do. Everything is wired into an amplifier-the TV, the Kodi Box, the Blu Ray, and TV. You are tired and you want to go inside and go to sleep-you are wiped out. Just walk inside, tell Alexa: “Alexa, turn off (Plug A/B/C/outside entertainment cluster-whatever you named it). “ Yes, she will turn it off from inside your house. Again, you save money on electricity because you did not have to let it ‘run’ all night long. If you need more plugs just buy them- the cost of the outlet pays for itself (it is a three prong and I don’t know if you can ‘piggy-back’ safely off of them.) Thank you for reading this rather lengthy review. I apologize that it is a little longer than most of the ones I write, but I really, really love this device and I think you will too. I will probably wind up buying five more before the year is over. I wonder what George Jetson wou","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
good switch for when you decide to make your room smarter.,5.0 ,"Good just good, i am making my room smart , so far i had only the Echo dot, the D-Link Smart Plug and the wowfeel Wi-Fi Smart LED Light Bulb . the dlink was controlling my window ac unit an was the farthest switch from the Dlink router, then the wowfeel lighbulb was odviously controliing the light and dimming but i needed something to control my personal fan and this is where the kmc comes in. Installing it was easy, it does come with a little booklet that tells you the procedure and it paired on the first try using the house wifi. nothing to note on this other than it was quick pairing and was good to go within 10 minutes of getting the box from amazon, it does the have button so that you can turn the power on or off by just pushing that button and you don't have to use alexa everytime. ( but i do anyways lol). There is a plot twist though. lol Every now and then the Dlink Switch would act up and would loose connection to the router, making me furious when alexa would tell me that the ac is not responding, and i would have to get off my ass and manually reset the switch which can get pretty annoying the more often you do it in a hot room. this issue happened about 3 to 6 times a month. Here is the awesome part, i decided to switch the kmc switch in the far location where the dlink switch was and boom. The KMC has a better receptor than the dlink and the issue hasn't come back in almost 3 weeks since i installed the kmc on the far location. Very happy with the switch and will definitely be getting more for when i decide to add on more stuff to my room. I don't really have any cons for this though, the switch looks even slimmer and better shape than the fat square dlink and has the same capabilities to measure wattage used so i am very happy and this one is cheaper than the dlink for sure. The app that you use with it is simple, elegant and quick. i love how i can turn the switch off or on from anywhere in the world.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
Great Smart Plug,5.0 ,"This is my third KMC Smart Plug. They work great (so far - will report back if this changes), simple to setup via the iOS app and especially like the power monitoring feature although at times it doesn't seem to be very accurate, but what the heck at least you can tell the device is turned on and drawing power which is more than most of the other devices provide.

"Another flawless install, and great performance",5.0 ,".....Upon receiving any package, first appearance of the products packaging is very ""crucial"" to any one person's opinion. Appearance of the package is the responsibility of the seller. But remember, usually the seller is having their product shipped from another location / partner. That facility is responsible for the shipping and handling of the packaging. My first thought about the items packaging was a 10 on a scale of 1 - 10. ..........I made this purchase because of the price and small size. So far I have bought different name brand smart plugs to see if there is any difference in performance. I absolutely haven't noticed any difference in performance. The performance is ""TOTALLY"" the same out of all them. I have fully tested, and tried all sorts of different settings, only to get the same results. I have only noticed 1 difference. And that's ""ONLY"" the physical part of these devices.... THE SIZE. These are same in size as all the rest. Except for the round ones. TAKE NOTE:::: To all you cry babies or illiterates, Before you go complaining about these plugs or any others, look at the equipment your using to communicate with these devices. These devices have only one function. And that's to turn on and off. THAT'S IT!!!!! Good wifi signal is most important which is given to these plugs from ""YOUR"" own router. And secondly is the app your using to make these plugs do different scenarios. Get rid of your cheap junk (router) and get something of good quality, if your having trouble with any smart device. Any smart device is only as good as the router sending it the commands. .....This is my 7th set of smart outlets. I kept waiting until the price would drop a bit more before making my purchase. I have read multiple reviews about smart plugs and can see where some would have trouble and others not. I read the directions unlike a many of others and was very successful in having mine connected and operational. To be exact, in ""21"" secs I was done. I will give a word of advice to those that feel they don't have to read the directions. READ THE DAMN DIRECTIONS!!! Also the first thing some want to do, is start pressing buttons when a device is turned on or plugged in. For this device here, plug it in and don't touch a thing. There is an app you can download for this item. I love the 4.5 star review for this particular app. ""TuyaSmart"" app i have always been very successful with it. To be a success in setting up this smart outlet, do the following: 1). Download the app of your choosing 2). Plug in the device, wait for light to begin flashing. 3). Follow the app directions Do the above and you will be up and running in under a minute. I have also posted some pics of the important part of the direction manual for you to view. I like my purchase, size, and feel of this device. It's well made, and does what it's described to do. Also, once the device is up and running, you can then press the button to manually turn the device off and on. This goes for all smart plugs. I definitely recommend this unit to anyone looking to smarten their lives. .....When making any purchase, I take the time in reading others reviews and make any comparisons with theirs against my results. I then leave as much honest ( positive or negative ) information as possible from my testing of the said product in order to help others. As in all my reviews, I do update when a problem occurs with any product that's out of the ordinary. Also I sometimes check in to update about the enjoyment I'm still receiving from my purchases. My review here, is strictly based on my personal opinions, and experience. I give rank to each product with a 1-5 star rating. Below you will find the details on what I personally feel each star represents when I am reviewing a product. 1 star) = Waste of money- will return 2 star) = Strongly Dislike the product- will not be purchasing again 3 star) = Indifferent- Neither like or dislike the product 4 star) = Like product 5 star) = AMAZING product.

Either it's an unfair policy or downright unethical bait & switching...,1.0 ,"I took advantage of the recent ""Lightning Deal"" on this and bought it. I've got another from a previous purchase that I set up and works as expected so I was excited to get another for about a third off. This one, however, doesn't work. The app sees it, connects to it, and even (audibly) actuates the power relay BUT the power to the unit's socket ALWAYS stays on. The lamp I'd plugged into it never turns off. The 'Smart Plug' clicks and the app shows it's off, but it REALLY isn't. The lamp shines on, bright as ever. Ugh.... so I called Amazon Support who was happy to arrange a return & refund, but informed me that they can't do an exchange for a working unit NOR could they honor the price I'd paid if I bought a replacement due to their arrangement with KT-KMC. I could buy THE EXACT SAME DEVICE now (five days later) for $5+ more. Grrr..... Did KT-KMC save their defective units for the Lightning Deal promo? Unethical Bait & Switch if you ask me.

A Good Smart Plug with Some Major Drawbacks,3.0 ,"Firstly, I should say I love the functionality of this smart plug. I have it connected to my Echo Dot in my bedroom and it makes going to bed so much easier than before. However, I have had problems is almost every step of installation. Firstly, I had to try several plugs in my home to get the plug to actually blink letting me know it's ready to connect, next there is absolutely no directions on how to connect to the echo dot. Luckily, one of our reviewers have finally made a clear and concise set of directions on how to properly set up and get running. I also do not like AT ALL how much information you need to give KMC in order to complete registration of your app and smart plug. I see no reason to have to give my phone number to use a switch. Secondly, the smart life app constantly runs in the background without stopping, and you cannot force stop. It makes me wonder why a simple plug app needs to always be running. I deleted the app and now I use the echo to use it instead of having an app running 24/7. That being said, once it's FINALLY set up it's quite nice to have and I think it's safe to say it was worth the $8 I paid for it. I just wish the registration wasn't so intrusive and the didn't need to ALWAYS run.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
Indicator Light Make Hulk Mad,3.0 ,"There wasn't any indication on the product page that the green WiFi symbol lit up and at the time of purchase, I didn't see any customer photos that showed it glowing. While I get that this indicates if the unit is working.. UGHHHHH. I've put about 3 layers of white electrical tape over the symbol and there is STILL a light green glow. I can handle it better now, but who needed the lamp attached to this when the WiFi symbol nearly lit up my whole side of the bed at night? I also noticed that the unit runs hot. Like, something this size using that little power should not be running hot, type of hot. Luckily I only use this while I'm present at home (instead of using it as a timer), but this is not going to be something I'll be using for Christmas lights, etc. when I may be away. My fear is only reinforced by the experiences other users have shared. YIKES! I would definitely not buy this again. For now, it enables me to be lazy and turn off the light from the comfort of my bed.

I bought this to replace a brand name smart plug from a well known networking equipment manufacturer,4.0 ,"I bought this to replace a brand name smart plug from a well known networking equipment manufacturer. Setting up the brand name plug was a frustrating, three hour exercise that ended in phone tag with support and failure. In contrast, this KMC thing which was less than half the price was set up almost automatically in about 3 minutes, and then connected it to my Echo very easily. The switch goes on/off before my Echo replies OK. I wasn't expecting this thing to work this well because of the price, but, wow, I'm impressed. An unexpected bonus is that the app lets you look at energy usage. It's not a great interface with graphs and stuff, but it gives you the kwh usage total for the day and the current, power, and voltage right now. It's not a specialized meter but it does the job (that I didn't even expect something this cheap to do). Some reviewers mentioned that the instructions are terrible. They were actually okay for me. I think the manufacturer updated their documentation. I mean, it's definitely not written but someone who is super well versed in English. But it's mostly clear (though sometimes too detailed---it even explains how to set up an Echo Dot in case you bought it with an Echo Dot and you're new to this whole thing). Minus one start for the very loud click when it goes on/off, though.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
"Really good wifi range, that is the main thing to target when choosing a device.",5.0 ,Simple and straight forward design as you would find in other brands costing much more. The wifi signal strength on the unit is what I would describe as mid-high range so having the unit on the other side of your house and it still functioning properly on range should be possible. Not all units are created equal and the wifi signal and transmit are the main limitations on this device. On a side note the software recommended does work well but I still recommend Jinvoo Smart to connect the device to the Alexa service if that is your end goal for use.

"Find the right app, and simple and quick home automation.",5.0 ,"I already have a few of the HausBell Smart Outlets. I have used the Tuya app on Android to set them up and control them, as well as integrate into my Echo Dot. I suspected these might be similar, if not same underlying hardware, so took a chance. Initially, due to an error on my part, Tuya would not find it. So I downloaded an app another reviewer mentioned as working. Surprise.. It was same app, but slightly different branding. Then I realized that, unlike the HausBell that startup in search mode, able to be discovered, these require a simple long-press to get into the proper mode. I closed the other app, opened Tuya, searched and the plug was located and setup in perhaps 30 seconds. Unlike the HausBell models I have, these show up in the app with extra option to monitor power usage! Excellent bonus! I just set it up a few hours ago, so this is an initial impression. But since I already was familiar with a similar product, getting it setup ended up being one extra button press and done.","KMC Smart Plug,Timing Switch Power Monitoring Smart Socket,Any Network 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi,10A 125V-240V,Works with Amazon Alexa"
Best decision ever!,5.0 ,I have an Alexa so I was searching for a smart plug to have a better use of the app. I decided to try this one out and it was so easy to use.

Great Alexa companion once you get it set up.,4.0 ,"This smart plug does would great with the echo once you get it set up. The directions aren't the greatest. I actually found myself coming back here and looking at other people's examples of instructions. Once I finally got it, integating it with Alexa was easy. I plugged a tall lamp into it that is in an awkward, hard to reach place. I named it livingroom lamp in my Alexa app, and voila. I just have to tell Alexa to turn it on or off for me. Saves so much hassle.

"Easy to connect. Works with Alexa, even through Amazon Dash Wand. Fits the end of most power strips.",4.0 ,"I've only recently figured out that my Amazon Dash Wand has a lot of the Alexa functions of the Echo. This is around the third Smart device I've tried, and it works fine. The connection approach seems to be the same for all these devices. Download an app from the Smart device maker. Register there. Then put the information into your Alexa app. Somewhere along there you give this Smart device a unique name, by which I mean a name that sounds different so Alexa can figure out which device you are turning on and off. I suppose I'll eventually have everything I can thing of under Smart control, but I'm not there yet 😬. Oh, this device has a better shape than some, and doesn't block the next socket. However, it has to be on one end of the power strip or wall sockets, because of the orientation of the ground plug.

This one is awesome!,5.0 ,"This one is awesome! It is very easy to make it working with one of our lights in our living room.

I can send them a signal to go to bed by turning it on and off few times when they're late watching TV in the living room. Good thing is I still can check if it is on or not even when I'm not in the house. It has no issue and works well as advertised. Super easy to setup. I also use my Amazon fire TV stick remote to turn it off by voice. I just can say ""turn off the living room light"" then it understands and turns it off. So cool.

Works great for a great price,5.0 ,Finally went for a smart plug. Price is right and works great with Alexa. It has its own app for your mobile device which is pretty cool cause you can monitor the electrical usage and turn the lights on and off from anywhere. You can also set up a timer or have it shut off after a length of time. I bought a different brand for the outdoors and has its own app. Wish they could use the same application rather then having 2 different apps.

I could see all the wifi devices that were active and inactive, and I saw my iPad was running at 5 GHz which this smart plug doesn't support, that's what was making the network unstable as far as the smart plug was concerned and as soon as I shut off the iPad and tried again to add the smart plug device to the Geeni app it connected and then I just enabled the device to my Amazon Dot Alexa and I was off to the races. I plugged in a fan, told Alexa to turn it on and she did. How cool is that. I hope this information about the unstable network caused by another device running at 5 GHz will help some of you decide to buy this item, it really works well and the price was right.

So if you draw more than that it will just shut itself off and stay off. There is no need for this and it renders the plug useless. If your going to introduce a lame feature like current limiting at least do it at a level consistent with most home circuits which would be 15 Amps. My guess is they can make it cheaper and reduce liability by shutting down the switch at 11 amps. But again makes it useless. They claim 2400Watts in the product description. This is not accurate its more like 1100. Your homw breakers will protect the circuit. There is no need for the smart plug to do it. Bought a tp link to replace and its much better without the current limiting issues. It does cost more which is a bummer.

Bought one and like it so much I kept buying more.,5.0 ,"This light switch and the other outlet style plug has worked reliably for over 3 years. There would be occasional hiccups like power interruptions that cause the switches to restart, but they have never failed on me. However, you are at the mercy of your internet connection and if you happen to be away while the network crashes, you won't be able to communicate with the switches. The daily programs will continue to work regardless. Setting this up properly does require some networking knowledge and how to properly implement security. The switches both work on hidden and broadcasted SSID Wifi networks. Half of my switches work on the hidden SSID and the other half are connected to the broadcasted SSID. They do support security password keys, but if you want an extra layer of protection, turn on your basestation's MAC address check to enable access to your Wifi network. I have assigned static IP address to these switches to avoid conflict when power cycling happens to my router. This is the general rule for all of my stay-at-home devices. Update 2017 My eleventh switch will be arriving tomorrow. The first switch I bought in 2013 is still working to this day. All switches are still working reliably. Works perfectly with NEST thermostat, Amazon Echo and IFTTT for voice control.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Works, but was a hassle to set up due to bad firmware version.",3.0 ,"I purchased this item from Amazon on January 9th, as a pre-order from when they were released as a new item on January 10th, 2017. After receiving two defective units from Amazon, and before returning the second, I decided to play around with it more and do some more research online. I am posting this to help anyone else who purchased this and is having trouble getting it to connect to your local WiFi network. I did get the unit working fine, but I removed two stars from my review because of the hassle of getting it to work. I spent over an hour with WeMo tech support, who offered no solutions, and made me jump through a bunch of hoops in the process. Cycling a reboot of my router did nothing. Changing my WiFi password did nothing. Disconnecting my phone from cellular service did nothing. The issue with these early units lies in the fact that they seem to get ""confused"" if you have other WeMo devices in your home. When trying to set up this WeMo mini, the WeMo app on my iPhone would find the device after I connected to its WiFi. The screen would show the device, ask me to name it, and click ""Next"". After clicking next, it would get stuck trying to get the device to find my home WiFi network. I have 4 other ""older"" WeMo devices (none of which ever had any issue connecting). I have a WeMo light switch, and 3 regular WeMo smart plugs. Two of the other WeMo smart plugs were easily accessible, so I tried completely unplugging them (not just turning them off). I did a factory reset on the WeMo mini I purchased, went through the app process of connecting it again, and voila! It immediately found my WiFi network and connected. And then it immediately downloaded a firmware update. So it seems like WeMo is aware of an issue, yet their tech support wasn't informed. And so far, I seem to be the only one publicly acknowledging the issue with these early release devices and buggy firmware. So long story short, if you have other WeMo devices in your household, and have trouble getting this WeMo mini to connect, try unplugging as many of the other devices as you can (they will automatically reconnect online after you plug them back in), factory reset the mini, and go through the setup process again. It should hopefully work.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Worked well for ~2 months,1.0 ,"I bought 4 of these light switches about a month after they were released. I had been adding motion detector lights, dusk-to-dawn lights, etc., to both improve energy efficiency and safety in my house. My purchase was designed to move further toward both of these issues, along with a new Kwikset lock and some security cameras. Installation was relatively simple, even for someone who is not an electrician. As long as you have the proper wires and follow instructions, as other reviewers have mentioned, installation should not be too difficult (check before ordering though). Connecting to the WiFi was also not difficult for me. I have a Linksys router in the basement with a Linksys range extender upstairs and WeMo did not have any problems connecting when I followed instructions. The initial firmware update took quite a long time and the initial iPhone app version that I downloaded was *very* slow to detect the switches each time I loaded the app, but they seem to have fixed the latter issue. Once it was all setup, I LOVED it. I used IFTTT to automatically make sure lights were turned off at night and on in the morning, among other things. I really like the look of them and changed out many of my fan switches and other switches to the decorator-style to make it look even nicer. Really, really like the look of them, although I could see it not fitting as well in certain instances (I am definitely not an interior decorator). I do wish that these would work with 3-way lights (where you have two light switches that control the same light) or as dimmers, but unfortunately they don't. Here's the problem: two days ago, the power to the router went out for about 30 seconds, then turned back on. The internet and WiFi loaded fine and all of my devices worked fine - except two of the 4 light switches could no longer connect to WiFi! They would both just blink orange non-stop. I tried all of their support instructions on their website, which was minimal, and included resetting and restarting the device. Of course, now one of the switches started blinking green and I could no longer even turn the lights on manually. So I caved and called their support number (difficult to find, but calling the corporate headquarters 800-number routed me to support). Here is where it got really frustrating because, among other things, the person on the line spoke very poor English. It took about 35 minutes to get through the initial questions around model number, what lights were blinking, when I purchased the product, etc. In between each question, she would tell me to ""hold on a second"" and mute her line, before often (at least 10 times, no exaggeration) returning and asking me a question I had already answered. Multiple times, she forgot to mute her line and I heard her joking with her friends. But, OK, I only hold Belkin partially accountable for that. After over an hour, and having me try everything I already tried, she finally said she would send me a new one. For now, I have two switches that cannot connect to WiFi and one that cannot even turn the lights on. It is simply not worth all of this hassle just to be able to remotely turn some lights on and off. To make it worse: they only provide (poor) customer service for free for 90 days! After that, you have to pay to talk to someone. Luckily (unluckily?), mine broke after 60 days so I could get someone on the phone. I really wanted to like the product, and I would have if there was some quality control or better customer support, but unfortunately for me it didn't work out.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"I really wanted to like it, but the failure rate & modes are shockingly high & incompatible with safe, sustained use (updates)",1.0 ,"I really, really wanted to like this product & technology, but the failure modes and failure rates are astoundingly high. Relevant background to my skill levels: I bought a couple of the plugs so that I could experiment with how to automate my home. I am neither a software or hardware engineer, however I am a (very highly) qualified engineer and I have self taught myself a lot about network hardware & application of software packages. I have an advanced router with repeater, fully LAN & WAN connected house, with network switches, POE devices etc. that I installed & runs pretty cleanly. First of all the app - I am still on 2nd level support waiting for a response to an issue where I am patient zero. I can create a rule, but it does not give me the choice of days. It is the same rule every day or no rule at all. I have tried installing the app on 2 i devices, same issue(the even have different itunes accounts to further firewall them from each other) So the app is highly buggy. App version 1.17.1. 2nd, the switch(es) I have RMA'ed one of my 2 as I still could, the first one I am stuck with. The 2nd one experienced worse functionality issues than the first one. It had to go as this is a defective unit. The rules limited me, so I tried anyway. Initial first time setup was quite smooth & I was initially impressed. (Hadn't realized the rules issues yet) Paired it to Alexa, that was pretty smooth too (Still impressed) Ran it for a few days, had fun having Alexa switch it on & off etc. Then we had a power outage. Big system failure on the WEMO. After restarting power, everything else came back up properly. I tried restarting the first switch (the still semi functional one that is not RMA'ed) several times to see if it would boot up, it actually would not boot up until I had pushed the power button several times & actually physically unplugged & replugged it several times. The WEMO devices were not recognized by the app on my phone, until I switched it to the same wifi network as they were running on. This i snot helpful when you are trying to make a remote access switch. So after trying & rebooting I have given up. I cannot set up a smart house with devices that require a full factory reboot and me to delete the app, reset all rules from scratch, every time the power fails or blips. So sadly I have to say the devices are junk, the app is junk and they need to be fully redesigned before both parts of the system become stable & reliable. Sorry Belkin, but you also have a lot of people on your own Community pages with many similar problems & your own support is not the one finding solutions, it is other users who have more time to do this than most of the rest of us have. So, folks, if you read this far, don't waste your time & money, these devices are great in concept, but are far from Implementation Ready for mainstream use. I have never been paid to write a review - good or bad and I have never been given anything for a review, except for one thing that was sent to me that I didn't want & I contacted the vendor & asked for an RMA (They said donate it - so I did). What you read is my genuine experience. Sadly 1 star reviews get pushed out of sight on Amazon & they are hard to access (even your own ones). Thanks for your time. Updated 3/17 to add rules screenshot showing the app issue with no days selectable. App version 1.17.1 (420001) that I am trying to deal with on 2nd level support. I still struggle with the concept that I am the only person with this issue & that it is identical on 2 unrelated Apple devices that are on different accounts. Just a side note - when Customers are on the phone with your reps, when discussing the product, it really makes a better impression of your company when they are aware of who your major competitor(s) are. 1st level support had never even heard of TP Link (check the recording it you don't believe me). 3/30/2017 update. I found a workaround out of sheer frustration & anger &, well, it is still strange. I had a blank screen for the days selection when creating rules. Nothing showed up at all, ever, I have deleted & reinstalled the app 3 times, done a full hardware reset on the switches 3+ times, had Belkin 2nd level support on the phone - you name it. (That was a whole different story - see the response comments!) So I was giving it one last try to see if it would work, I reinstalled everything from scratch. Set up a new rule - still nothing snowing in the days area of the screen. So I was really very angry about how much time & energy I had spent on this whole exercise & I was absentmindedly tapping my phone screen repeatedly, when I suddenly noticed that it was highlighting days of the week. So I played around some more. I can get it to highlight, at most, 6 of 7 days, in any combination. I have to guess where the day is to be selected on the screen, then I can find it. I sometimes have to tap that spot several times to get the day to select (no it is not my touchscreen, both devices have the same response) What I then found out was, if I select a day & I can now see it, that means that day is one in which the rule will NOT work. It Will work on the days that are not selected & still invisible on the screen. I have attached a couple of random screen shots so you can see what is going on. Is the issue fixed - no, not at all, it is still there & the software still has a huge flaw. Does it work enough that I want to continue to try to experiment with it - yes Will I want to see a software update to fix this issue - yes Do I want to continue to use this switch for the short term - yes So in short, I will not send it back, yet. There is something going on. I tried this workaround on 2 different Apple products (Iphone 6 & Ipad Mini 3) and the workaround works on both. Is it still fatally flawed - yes. Please can you pass this on to your 2nd or even higher level Engineers as there is still a problem that must get fixed, but this is a partial workaround. By the way, I also tried changing the screen color settings to see if it was screen contrast or color related - no it is not, the Apple devices are working exactly as they should, it is your software with the bug. If you want me to try anything else, have your engineers get in touch & we can see what we can do. I have still lost significant confidence in the product & am very unsure if I want to invest in any more of them to automate other parts of my home at this time.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Got two of these so I could program them while ...,4.0 ,"Got two of these so I could program them while away. The programming DON'T WORK! Just last night, I programmed them to turn off after 2 hours on. This morning, they are still on. So if you are looking for away mode or any other programming, look elsewhere. I must edit this review. Between the time I wrote it and now, I have been able to get a programing workaround. By setting a scheduled time for the Wemo to start and then a duration for the light to stay on, and setting a separate on time and duration for each Wemo, I now have a functioning program for each. Will continue to play, but within reason I can get the Wemos to do what I want. I will not give them five stars, because of complexity of setup, but I will award 4 stars. Note: I am a retired programmer/analyst, but it shouldn't need someone similar to me to get these things working. Still have not gotten the away mode to work, but I am still trying.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Pro Tips for new and old users alike!,5.0 ,"Love the redesign! Now I can plug two smart plugs into the same wall outlet. With this new version, setup was far easier than the old model. Some Pro Tips I discovered when setting my home up... 1) If your cell phone is connected to wifi using AC band, you'll want to switch your phone wifi connection to an older wifi protocol (a/b/g/n) before attempting to connect to the Wemo. It reduces the setup time tremendously as the app tries to be helpful and copy over your stored wifi settings/password information to the Wemo smart plug. (since they device doesn't support AC, it will fail by default). 2) It is very easy to test if a device could become ""smart"" by using this plug. Simply unplug something like your Air Conditioner (while running) at the plug. When you plug it back in, if the Air Conditioner turns back on, then it will work great with this plug. I now turn my fans and Air Conditioner on and off using Alexa! 3) When you setup devices, you can ""cheat"" and make abbreviations/synonyms work on Alexa. I setup my Air Conditioner Plug to be called ""Air Conditioner"" so it works by voice command. I also put it, as the exclusive plug, in a group called ""AC"" so my wife can also refer to it that way. It works!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great product, great price. I highly recommend this for simple switch automation/Google Home integration",5.0 ,"I'm in the slow process of performing some minor home automation projects to integrate with the two Google Home devices in the house and was looking for a hub-free solution that was comparable in cost, but that avoided the additional cost of a hub. I bought two of these to control two lamps on my bedside night stands and a standalone lamp in my living room. It took just a few minutes to connect the devices through the wemo app and get them provisioned in the Google Home app. I've had them a few days at this point and I love it: it is so convenient to be able to turn lights on or off when getting home late just by yelling for the Google home to turn on the lights or, if I want to make sure I turned them off before leaving in the evening, to check the app and confirm they're off. While the Google Home can't yet schedule lights to turn on and off natively, the Wemo app can and the Google Home can do it with help from IFTTT. Overall, I'm very satisfied with these devices and I expect I will add more as I find new opportunities to leverage smart devices in my home.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Small, reliable, convenient.",4.0 ,"Love this little device. I use it to power on/off a heater from my iPhone and it works flawlessly. I would give it five stars, but it is missing two features, one is easy to fix through a software update. My first issue is that this device is not HomeKit compatible, this is by no means a dealbreaker, but it does prevent some functionality that HomeKit users get from their other devices. The second issue, that could be fixed with an update, is the inability to set either an ON or Off timer. The only timer option with specific times is an On/Off setup only; otherwise, you can set a countdown timer. I wanted to ensure the heater would shut off if I forgot to turn it off. With the current timers available I was able to set a very short On/Off timer (ex. On at 7:59AM Off at 8:01AM) to ensure the heater will always be off by 8:02AM. However, based on the ease of setup, the convenient instal ion options, the price, and the reliability I will be buying more of these devices.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Very well designed switch ... Love it.,5.0 ,"I recently installed this switch (standalone) and really love it. Planning to get couple more when price comes down again. Little expensive for a standalone switch but the aesthetics, feel, usability and software are very nice and functional and also the reasons for my 5 Stars. I bought my first few WEMO (non-dimmer) switches in 2013 and since then I didn't see any progression towards 3 or 4 ways switches so finally had to move forward with other vendor (few days back) and changed all 3-4 ways switches in the house. Now why I feel that this switch is expensive? 4-way *** 1 Wemo WiFi Dimmer ($80) + $10 = 1 GE ZigBee Dimmer and Energy Monitoring Switch ($50) + 2 Add-On Switches ($40). 3-way *** 1 Wemo WiFi Dimmer ($80) - $10 = 1 GE ZigBee Dimmer and Energy Monitoring Switch ($50) + 1 Add-On Switches ($20). Single *** 1 Wemo WiFi Dimmer ($80) - $30 = 1 GE ZigBee Dimmer and Energy Monitoring Switch ($50) But I would definitely recommend this item for dimmable lights with standalone switches.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Never come home to a dark house again!,4.0 ,I had this installed about 6 weeks ago and has been great! I live in a condo where I really didn't have the option to install a motion sensor exterior light but was sick of coming up in the dark.

It's on a one-day deal for about $20 off today and I'm seriously considering buying another for the kitchen. I do wish it worked for lights that can be operated by multiple switches so I could install on in the living room but currently it's only a single-pole set-up (which is why I subtracted a star).,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
A product worthy enough for me to review!,5.0 ,"I bought this switch to replace a manual switch to my jetted tub. My bathroom is rather large, and the builders put the switch on the opposite wall of the tub. I have a ceramic tile floor that can be slippery when wet.

I had to wait a little bit for all of the networks to be found, but it found it eventually. It is on my 2G frequency, but the 5G showed up as well. The app saw that there was a firmware update, so it did that right away. When done, the app and switch worked flawlessly. So now I don't have to get out of the tub to turn the jets on or off and I don't have to worry about slipping. I am 100% pleased with this purchase, which doesn't happen often for me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"WEMOs work great, Technical help line excellent",5.0 ,"I have two homes. My second home is in an area with unreliable commercial power. Recent storms brought frequently interrupted power. My security lights on mechanical timers were about 12 hours off schedule. I had to make an unplanned drive of 3 hours round trip just to reset them. WeMo Mini Smart Plugs have solved that problem. However, another problem has surfaced. I set the routers at each of my homes to the same SSID and password, so that whenever I show up, my electronics hook right up. The problem is that when I am present at one home network, I can only view the WeMos on that network and not the WeMos at the other home. If I switch off the WIFI on the smartphone and use my cellular data, I see them all. If I go to a remote WIFI, such as Starbucks, I can see them all. I assume that If I changed the SSID's to unique names, this would not be a problem, but I have not tested it. Here is the good news, I am especially happy with Belkin's telephone technical help line. When I phoned to resolve this issue, the line was immediately answered by a live technician. I explained the problem and she provided the answers. If there is any down side, it is that there is not any PC access, only the smartphone app. I love them, wonderful devices. Now that I have cut my teeth on the mini switches, I have the confidence in the products to purchase the light switch WeMo.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
A great product if you are okay with using other apps instead of WeMo's,4.0 ,"This is a great product. I love home automation products, and I make sure to research each one before I get it. The price may seem a little steep, but from what you get, it's worth it. After the rather complicated setup process, the light will work like normal. The real value in this switch is that you can pair it with other apps to do things like turn on/off at sunrise/sunset; turn on when you enter the room (if you have the additional motion sensor); and turn on other switches and lights (with IFTTT). IFTTT (If This Then That app) allows you to set up all these things and more. Plus, you can use other people's setups (or recipes) so you don't have to configure everything yourself. I have 2 switches: the one in the garage is paired with a WeMo outlet plug to turn on a box fan when I turn on the light (necessary in Texas :-D) and the one for the porch light turns on at sunset and off at sunrise. I would not recommend using the WeMo app after setting up the switches just because it is very slow and hard to use. It has a couple features, but IFTTT is really the best way to use WeMo products. Pros: Looks great! Small light to find the switch in the dark Very customizable with other apps Timers Can control other WeMo products (if used with IFTTT) Cons: Electrical work (call an electrician if you're unsure of what to do) Clunky software Sometimes weak signal Need additional apps to get the most out of it Price No integrated motion sensor (this would be great for kids' rooms)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
As simple as home automation gets,5.0 ,"I bought one of these to test out. First I must say it was fairly simple to wire up. 4 wires to connect. 1 green ground, 1 white neutral and two black hot wires. One for the input and the 2nd is the output to your light or plug. Fitting this back into the standard size box was another story. It is a tight squeeze! Configuration was quick and it has never lost connection as some people complain about. I control my lights via a schedule or I can ""manually"" turn them on or off via the iphone. Of course if you are just walking by you push the button to turn it on or off. I really like the vacation mode. Vacation mode is a simple mode that randomly turns lights on of off in a given time period to simulate activity around the house. For example. I turned my away mode on and between 7pm and midnght the lights can go on and off for periods of time. Outside of the time frame, the lights stay off so as to not waste energy and no one would see them anyways. Update: Test went well. I am going to start adding these as needed around my house. I have two switches and 1 plug so far.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works perfectly for us,4.0 ,"Love these. I installed them myself and it was pretty straightforward. I've wired light switches and outlets in our condo before so I have some experience with basic wiring. There are also multiple instructional videos on YouTube if you don't feel comfortable with home wiring. Also, setting them up and connecting them to wifi was pretty simple. We have multiple smart home devices on our network (Nest, Harmony remote, Hue lights, Smart TV) and we had no connectivity issues with our Wemo lights. We have one of these in the kitchen and another in our baby's room, I control them with my iPhone, my husband his android, and both of us use our Amazon Echo to control them as well. When combined with the Echo these lights are perfect for me to turn lights on without using my hands when I'm toting my newborn around. My husband also constantly leaves a trail of lights on wherever he goes and we both love not having to get up again to go switch lights in another room off. I am only giving four stars because there is no dimming feature which seems a bit ridiculous, with the price of these combined with current technology, it seems like they should have a feature as basic as a dimmer.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"A fine choice, but be advised...",5.0 ,"I was intrigued by the fact that so many of these were available ""Used"". I read the descriptive information available and wondered why so many would find fault with a product that, on the surface, has such a basic function and, seemingly, should be so easy to install. I think it comes down to this: the Wemo Light Switch requires a neutral wire in order to function (this is not readily apparent in the description of the thing). In most homes built since the days of ""knob and tube"" wiring, this means a ""white"" wire must be present in your switch-box - and that white wire must NOT be connected to the switch you're intending to replace (nor to any other switch present therein). So peek inside your switchbox before ordering this switch and see if you have a good neutral (or several of them all wire-nutted together). If you don't, it's probably not worth the trouble of pulling a neutral to the location - it may not even be possible or practical to do so. I had neutrals present (the electrician who wired this house apparently pulled the lighting circuits through the switch boxes) so the installation was straightforward. The Wemo app was a free download to my iPhone, and its setup and marriage to the switch was quick and straightforward. Everything works fine, and I'm happy. But I might not be if I'd bought a fifty-dollar switch only to find I couldn't use it...","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works Like Promised,5.0 ,"We have a light that is only switched from downstairs but is in our entry way that is open to the loft on the second floor where we like to use this light when watching TV. Being lazy and somewhat tech-inclined, we decided to solve for this problem with one of these switches. The install and hook-up to our wifi was pretty straight forward and worked on the first try (and I am by no means an expert here). The switch works flawlessly and is a really nice addition. We are even thinking of getting one for our teenager's room so that we can get their attention by turning the lights on/off when we want their attention (easier than yelling, texting or pounding on the door). In sum, we are happy and would purchase again.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Pre-set Timer rules don't work,3.0 ,"I like the idea behind this product, but none of the pre-set timer rules work. I am able to turn the plug on and off from within my house (I haven't tried doing so while not in my home). However, each time I select one of the pre-set timer rules, they don't work. Firmware is up to date, app is up to date; there's no reason that the rules don't work. It has the effect of introducing distrust about the product, and because I'm using the plug to make sure I don't leave a space heater running, knowing the plug is functioning is critical. Bottom line: If the rules worked, I'd give it a five star rating. Until then, I can't completely trust that it's doing what it says it's supposed to do.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Poor software and support,2.0 ,"I really like the idea - a smartphone enabled outlet and I went with Wemo because it's one of the more popular ones. Unfortunately I have been plagued with issues and support as of now has been unhelpful. The big one is that only the rules I created on day 1 work, any new rules I create do not save. So my day-to-day functionality is unaffected (thus 2 and not 1 star). Second, it did not recongize that Phoenix has no DST so even though that is the timezone on my device, the rules were an hour off until I reset to factory defaults. Third, the firmware does not upgrade successfully. To date I have been in a chat session with no success, so I will try calling next to see about getting it working. What a disappointment, I could have bought a cheaper competitor's product for this sort of lousy support.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
These switches were perfect. Despite seeing the negative reviews,4.0 ,"I recently moved into a new apartment where the light switches were not very conveniently placed. I also wanted to be able to turn my lights on while I'm away from home and planning to come back late. These switches were perfect. Despite seeing the negative reviews, I figured I should try them out anyway because I couldn't really find any other switches that seemed to be good of quality. Prior to purchasing these, I already own 4 WeMo Smart Plugs, so I already knew what I was getting into when it came to setting them up. The setup was pretty simple, although the box itself is a little big. I had a hard time pushing the switch into the electrical box because there were so many wires and there wasn't much space. I ended up just letting the switch and the panel stick out a little from the wall, not desirable, but good enough for me. Setting up the wifi can be a little scary, and I mainly blame it on their app. The app would crash a few timesin the middle of setting up the switches via wifi, and it was a mix feelings of ""did it work?"" and ""did I break it?"" as I continually restarted the app. Eventually it managed to get it all set up correctly though and now it works without a problem. I also had no major problems updating the firmware when it prompted me to. In conclusion, my main complaints about the WeMo Light Switch are how large the box is and the iffy setup process. I think really what they need to improve on is their app because I'm pretty sure that is what caused all my setup problems, however minor. It would also be nice if they allowed me to control WeMo switches at multiple homes instead of only one home. No, if you have 2 or more homes, even if both homes have the same WIFI names, you will only be able to access the WeMo switches/plugs at one of these locations. I had to learn this the hard way.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works great with Alexa,5.0 ,"Got this as a xmas gift 2015. Been using it for 7 months now with no issues whatsoever. Works great with Alexa, as I say, ""Alexia, turn on the light"" and light comes on. Subsequently, does the same with turning off. If you don't want to use Alexa, it's a very easy push switch. I installed this in my kitchen and when coming out with hands full, it's been very convenient. the app for my smartphone works great and you can also turn it on and off with a phone. This came in handy when I though I heard someone outside my home at 2:00 a.m. I turned on the light from my bedroom (kitchen is in front of house). Not sure if anyone was out there, but if there was, the light coming on may have alerted them. I think you can name the switch, as I recall being given that opportunity when setting it up 7 months ago, so if you buy two, you can tell alexa to turn on specific switches (I assume). When light is off there is an unobtrusive white light (dot) on the switch. When light is on, there is a cool looking green light that lets you know it's connected to the internet. My internet went down once recently and it blinked orange to indicate no internet. Switch worked manually fine, just no web connectivity hence no alexa or phone access. this resolved when internet went back online and I didn't have to reconfigure.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Easy to setup. So far so good. Read this if you have issues.,5.0 ,This item is easy to setup. Follow the instructions. Some people have said they had issues connecting but this is because they most likely did not follow ALL the instructions. First thing. Turn off smart wifi switch on your phone. Plug in your wemo Open your phone wifi settings again and connect to the wemo wifi network. Again make sure smart switch is off. Open the wemo app It should automatically detect since you just connected to wemo wifi. Name device and test. You are set. This is just a brief summary of what I did to set up. I had no issues so far and will update review if I have any issues later. I must stress that you turn of the smart network switch. For those who do not know the smart network switch activates on your phone if the wifi you are connected to doesn't have any internet connection. Since the wemo doesn't provide internet access you need to turn off the smart switch on your phone. Otherwise when you try to connect to wemo wifi on your phone it will automatically disconnect since it sees no internet access.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great for Alexa and turning on lights when not home if needed,5.0 ,"We own both a WeMo mini smart plug and a wall switchs. Having previously installed the switch our app was ready and the setup took 2 minutes. Be patient with Alexa it takes her a couple of additional minutes to sync up with the plug at first. Be sure they are both on the same wireless network (we have several) or she has trouble. I also recommend changing the WEMO name of the light to something as short as possible. If the name is to long it gives you more room for error when talking to Alexa so more like ""Alexa turn on front light"" instead of the default WeMo sets ""Alexa turn on WeMo Light Switch Front light"". You may need to ask her twice to do it the first time as we seemed to but once she has it we've not had any issues with the switch at all.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Huge Convenience,4.0 ,"I've had 2 WeMo Light Switches for a little over a year. I have the switches installed on my porch light and exterior garage light. Installation was simple after watching their online video a couple of times (and shutting off the power at the circuit breaker box). It's a HUGE convenience. I have the Amazon Echo so I just say ""Alex turn on outside lights"" and both lights turn on. I also have them setup to turn on automatically when I get home (using IFTTT). When my phone gets within a half mile of my house, the IFTTT rule will trigger and my front porch and garage lights turn on. I have to set it up for that range because it sometimes takes IFTTT 15 seconds to a minute to activate. But it's nice not to have to dig my cellphone out of my pocket to turn on the lights (especially in the winter when I'm wearing a heavy winter jacket). I only have 2 issues (otherwise I'd rate this 5 stars): 1) One of the switches recently flashed a yellow light. Then the next morning the switch stopped responding and it disappeared from the WeMo app. One of my plugin WeMo switches near that light switch also stopped working. I was able to reset the plugin switch by unplugging it and plugging it back in. But the WeMo Light Switch is hard-wired so couldn't be reset so easily. Fortunately all I had to do is shut off the circuit breaker switch for my front porch lights, then turn it back on. That reset the WeMo Light switch and got it working again. This only happened once since I installed the switch. 2) I really wish these light switches did not require a neutral wire built-in to your light switch box (I don't know the technical term). The only switches in my house that have neutral wires are for my exterior lights. I'd LOVE to be able to use these switches for my bedroom but I can't. Instead I have to use a WeMo plugin light switch. But sometimes I accidentally flip the physical light switch off (reflex upon leaving a room). Then when I try to use my Echo Voice Command to turn on my lights, it of course doesn't work. And then I have to flip the physical switch back on and wait for the WeMo switch to restart. Fortunately I have a set of Hue lights plugged into a different outlet, so I just use the voice command to turn those lights on instead. I like both WeMo and Hue, but my Hue lights are not very bright. I prefer to use 100 Watt LED lights with my WeMo switches. The Hue lights are nice as accent lights since I can change their colors and I can dim them. But they aren't very good for lighting up a large room. I tried buying a WeMo light starter kit but had problems with them turning on by themselves in the middle of the night. So I eventually unplugged them and they're sitting in a drawer somewhere.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I like it and its integration with Alexa. But it needs electrical skills to install and won't work with a two wire switch.,4.0 ,"I like it and it's integration with Alexa. If you're not handy with electrical stuff, hire an electrician to install ($100 or so for the trip and install). Install and pairing is sketchy on Android, works better with iOS. Once you have it paired, using Android is fine. IT won't work with a 2 wire switch, so if your switches are two wire, it won't work, period. Where I was just looking for one and off at specified times and no Alexa integration, I prefer: Switchmate: One-Second Installation Smart Lighting, Toggle, White Literally NO INSTALL, just put it over your switch, it has magnets and works from your smartphone via bluetooth or has a nice scheduler including sunrise and sunset. It also has a ""Welcome"" feature that can turn on things when you're in bluetooth range.

Not ready for prime time,3.0 ,"After three unsuccessful ""chats"" with customer support, we discovered together that the software written to control ""Away Rule"" does not work well with multiple switches. The most recent addition of a switch required removing all established rules for all devices, restoring the days older switch to factor defaults, removing the APP from the mobile device, reinstalling the APP, rediscovering each switch, reprogramming each rule in a specific order beginning with the Away Rule, then adding other rules that seemed less temperamental. All worked last evening, need to test the Away Rule again. All seems to work now, just deciding whether to indulge in a 3rd switch, and whether I should have the confidence to create any needed new rules. It really seems to be a software issue which Belkin does not have their arms around.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Deceiving, glitchy, bad firmware.",2.0 ,I bought this back in January. They have a much smarter design than the original wemo switches. There's 1 button vs 2. It's much smaller not blocking other outlets. But it did cost $5 more or so when I bought it. Unfortunately something I did not know was that there was going to be a firmware upgrade in the future that would cause all of my newer WeMo switches to constantly break down and stop working. Sometimes plugging them from the wall and starting Discovery again with Amazon Alexa will fix it. Sometimes it does not. Massive pain in the ass. I'm about to throw them all out. If I knew that spending an extra $5 would cause me this headache I would have never done it. When we called Belkin about the problem they told us it was a firmware issue that they would be working on.

All products are easy to set up, seamless to program and use, and have gone through numerous operating system upgrades and firmware updates and still working great. The Wemo Insight and Switch have been in use for at least three years and working great and not obsolete. This history gave me confidence to order another Wemo device, this one to replace a programmable light switch that controls the porch lights. The old switch (not internet enabled) had started acting oddly, the instructions long lost and reprogramming anything but intuitive. It took about ten minutes to kill the power, remove the old switch and wire up the Wemo light switch. It took another five minutes to connect the Wemo light switch to our wireless network and program it to turn on fifteen minutes before dark and turn off at 11:30pm.

Solid Product but the App needs some loving,4.0 ,"I received 3 of the WeMo Light Switches yesterday and installed them in a little over an hour. The switches seem pretty sturdy and they came with 4 wire nuts and the face place. The installation of the switches was very easy, just follow the instructions that are included in the box. **Make sure you have a neutral wire (usually a white wire tucked away in the back) in the outlet box. This is needed for the circuitry inside of switch to work.** After the installation, it was time to set it up to the home network. I downloaded the app onto my ipad and followed the instructions. The first thing you have to do is connect to the light switch's wireless network (same way you would select your home network). Once my ipad was connected to the switch, the app notified me that there was a firmware update for the switch. The update took about 5 minutes. Once the firmware update was complete, I could control the light switch using the app! I took it one step further and wanted to connect the light switch to my Amazon Echo (named Alexa). You ask Alexa to ""Find my devices"" and she will automatically find all the smart switches in the area. Unfortunately, she did not find my switch. I went into the WeMo app and reset the wireless settings for the switch and reentered the information. After doing that, the switch was discovered by Alexa and all was well again! I had 2 more switches and set those up without any issue. I think this is a 5 star product, but their app and slight troubleshooting when connecting to my Amazon Echo lost a star for me. The WeMo app crashed several times when I was trying detect the devices and update the firmware to the point where I didn't know if the firmware was updated or not. The app is also very basic and not very refined. Overall, this is a good switch and they seem to work well. However, it has only been about 12 hours since installation - I will update this if anything changes over time. Pairing the WeMo light switch with Amazon Echo is fun and raises the ""cool factor"" for anyone's house. It is one step closer to creating a Tony Stark house! :)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

With that switch you had to manually adjust the lowest brightness in order to make sure the lamps came on at the lowest setting. The WeMo dimmer does all of that through the phone app. Then it completely configures the WiFi access. It's also compatible with Amazon Echo. All I have to do when I walk in the room is say, ""Alexa, set family room to 50%."" Lamps come on to the correct output. If I wanted to touch the switch it is touch sensitive - no moving parts for the dimmer function.

A bit pricey.,3.0 ,I already have a Hue hub but the compatibility with Alexa is problematic so I gave this a shot. Hookup is no more complicated than any other light or dimmer switch and syncing with Alexander was easy. The price is not right though. I could have bought four dimmable Hue smart lights for slightly more than I paid for this one switch and way less than the Wemo dimmable switch. If I had had fewer issues with the Hue setup I probably would have gone that route except I have absolutely no need for this particular bank of lights to dim. I had one freaky issue.

At this point I am rating them three stars because of the difficulties I have had setting them up, but I acknowledge that I am far from expert in this sort of thing and if I can get all these clever devices I own to work as advertised I will upgrade my ratings.

Again, since I'm not handy, I worried about getting electrocuted trying to install this switch, but after switching off the breaker, it was a pretty straightforward install in my kitchen lights. Prior to installing this switch, I tried to install the Lutron Caseta Wireless Dimmer, but because of a poor install, the dimmer would cause the lights to flicker on and off like a strobe light. After some research, I realized that I couldn't use a dimmer without an expensive re-wiring of my kitchen can lights.

After years of searching I've finally settled on the almost-perfect device.,5.0 ,"You don't realize how useful these devices can be until after you've formed certain habits and have grown to rely on the automation and other home control features. Currently, I control most of my lights, one small space heater and an electric teapot using the voice commands with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. I've been using smart plugs from other brands before, but I've recently switched to WeMo for three main reasons: 1) IFTTT integration, 2) Google's ""Home Control"" and Amazon's Alexa ""Smart Home"" and 3) these plugs do not block the second outlet above or below it. The ability to control each plug using the voice command or Wemo's native App is nice, but in my experience I get the most out of these devices through various integration and automation. Here are a few examples: > When motion is detected by my Oco2 camera in the main entry way, the hallway lights are turned on automatically. (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, IFTTT, Oco2 camera) > Every morning turn on the space heater in the bathroom and turn it off after 30 minutes (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, WeMo App for scheduling) > When my car's ignition is turned on in the parking lot by my apartment, turn off all lights, arm the alarm, turn on cameras (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, IFTTT, AutoMatic Pro, Oco2 camera, Scout Alarm system) With the Google Home control as well as Alexa smart home feature, I've create a group of lights called ""Living Room"". Using one simple ""Hey Google, turn on lving room"" command, I can turn them all on (and off) at once. (Same thing can be done with the Echo's Alexa command). Using the similar ""Alexa, turn on the teapot"" command, I can get my teapot to boil water just using my voice. As time goes by, I'm sure I'll create even more automation ""recipes"". On the other hand I recently realized that I may rely on those too much, as one day when I had an outage with my internet service, I had to actually *gasp* walk up to the outlet and physically push its button. Perhaps it's a good thing; I could alway use some exercise.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Set Up Hints,4.0 ,"I bought 4 WEMO light switches to control my outdoor lights. If you buy multiples switches, I recommend you completely install each switch and link it to your WIFI before you install the next switch. I tried installing 2 switches in the wall and then linked them to WIFI. Those switches had intermittent problems being recognized by the WIFI over the next few weeks. I don't think the problem was WIFI signal strength because one of the switches with the problem was less than 10 feet from the router, while one of the switches that never had a problem being recognized was over 40 feet away. I finally googled the problem and found out how to reset the switches when they aren't recognized by WIFI. Now they work fine. I concluded the problem was how I set them up. Belkin has a help video on resetting on their site. FYI this problem didn't affect the operation of the timer -- the lights went on and off as scheduled.

Must buy because of its capability. You can remotely use and I won't eat up the space in two outlet wall as it sits perfectly on the wall without any issue. Also setting up is really easy and you won't encounter any issues if you follow the correct procedure. Must buy for a tech geeks and people who look for any home automation system without needing any bridge or hub. Pricing is sweet spot and will definitly recommend to all ages.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
So much untapped potential!,2.0 ,"I'm really disappointed with this switch at the moment. It has the potential to be amazing, but the developers need to step it up in a few areas: Switching: When the device is powering up the switching function doesn't work. You'll hardly ever encounter this unless you lose power or you hit the reset button on the switch, but be prepared to wait when you do. I expect a switch to always operate as a switch even when it's smarts aren't started up. IFTTT: IFTTT integration is horribly slow. Currently a switch press takes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes to register. This is hopelessly long when you are trying to operate the lights across the room. This is with the latest firmware on the switches. Size and Reset button placement: These switches are big, and have a lot of depth. You're going to be jamming those wires all the way to the back of the box to fit the switches in. The other challenge is fitting two side by side and lining up the cover on both switches. The problem lies in the placement of the reset button. If the switches aren't lined up precisely with the cover plate it will put enough pressure on the reset button to trigger a constant restart cycle. Multiple houses/wifi networks: WeMo does not currently support more than one wifi network with switches. You'll need a unique device (Smartphone/tablet) to control each network with WeMo devices.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"I love them, when they work properly (and they are now, after some support from Wemo)",4.0 ,"UPDATE 2/5: Wemo support was able to assist in re-setting the offending mini and they are both working now. I did have an issue with one that is now behaving on its own. Unless they act up again, I think a 4 is appropriate. I will leave it at 4 not 5 because of the problems, but am happy with the way they work and how easy they were to set up. ----------- I hope to update this to more stars. When the mini smart plug works, it's great. I have one that works most of the time and one that rarely works properly. They were easy to set up and program, but the fact that they are so unreliable is what is responsible for the two stars.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Nice dimmer, works great with Alexa",5.0 ,"A very nice addition to the other WeMo devices in my home. Note that Alexa cannot discover dimmers directly on the LAN (unlike other on/off WeMo switches) so you must add the WeMo skill to Alexa to allow your dimmers to be discovered. Switches look very high tech with their built-in light feedback. One tiny light (dimmer level) stays on when the switch is off, which makes switches easy to find in the dark, a nice touch. Touch-sensitive dimming works well. Multiple dimmers can be controlled at the same time by creating Alexa groups. It's awesome to be able to say ""Alexa, set kitchen lights to 50"" and control all the kitchen dimmers with one phrase. My only complaint is that I wish these switches cost less so I could buy more of them!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Fantastic product highly recommended!!!!,5.0 ,"Absolutely love these switches! If you own an echo these work fantastic with Alexa. These switches are relatively easy to install as long as you have basic electrical knowledge. These are very quick to respond on wifi but has a slight delay over mobile network but this isn't so long you would notice. I own both the outlet switch and the light switch and both are awesome and I highly recommend to anyone trying to automate their lights in their home. Only downside is would say is price, since other competitors are 30-50% less expensive. There are times Belkin will run coupon codes for discounts l, this is what I did and got for roughly 35 each.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Otherwise you may save money with a smart bulb that can be dimmed,3.0 ,"I am using this dimmer for my bedroom. Otherwise, for my living room I prefer the ones from Lutron that are cheaper and turn on an off automatically depending on light and motion. But you don't want a motion sensor controlling the lights of your bedroom. If you have an appliance with three lamps or more it is cost effective to buy this dimmer. Otherwise you may save money with a smart bulb that can be dimmed. I like the easy interface with google home. It just works. It gently wakes me up automatically every morning gradually increasing the lighting. On the negative side, it is a bit expensive. It needs an integrated light and motion sensor. The unit sent to me came without installation instructions. I could figure it out but an untrained customer would have been upset.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"WeMo mini - so far, so good",5.0 ,Setup is temperamental but after 3rd time of starting the app the automated setup routine started and there is no way to force it to run. Whenbut fails you get an overview of setup process but not the actual setup. Force close and try again. The first device hung up on firmware update and I ultimately returned it to Amazon. I took a chance and replaced it plus added two others. The setup process is the same when you add units. Connect wifi to the new device and let the app find it and complete setup. Subsequent devices were faster since the home wifi information was already stored. All three minis are working perfectly right now. Easy to add rules once the devices are recognized. I also like that it is easy to manually switch on/off using either the power button or the app.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Doesn't appear to work easily with my belkin router.,2.0 ,"I don't like it. This Belkin Wemo Mini does not connect to my Belkin router out of the box, and the 17-pages of help posted on the wemo/belkin site under ""WeMo Set Up Problems - can't connect to WiFi"" suggests lots of arcane router reconfigurations and multi-step handshakes that didn't help. After the 3rd (of 20+) time of re-entering my email address in an attempt to scan for local networks, I truly loathed the marketing genius who decided to require email scraping in the configuration procedure. I hope he has a profitable relationship with a at a.a This switch might work easily with some routers, but so far, no luck with mine. ********* Update The resetting and modem reconfiguration suggestions at the Wemo support did not seem to work, however, I was able to discover my own home network by first selecting my neighbor's NetGear router, then cancelling a few times, then my Belkin router was detected and could be connected. I'll watch it for a while.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
2 things to think about before purchase! But recommended!,5.0 ,"Honestly love this WeMo Light Switch! I will warn you to check your switch that you're planning on installing this into - 1. Does it have a neutral wire? Some older homes don't. 2. Is it a single switch? (i.e. There's only one switch that will turn on the light not two like one at the top of the stairs and one at the bottom). If you answered yes to both these questions, WeMo will work for you. You should have basic electrical wiring knowledge to do this. My house was built in 1935 so the wiring can be unusual - I ended up having to create a pigtail for the neutral wires, which obviously requires wire and additional wire nuts. However, if your home is more recent this should be a straightforward job.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
They both fit easily into the small metal outlet box clearly made for ...,5.0 ,"After being die-hard wemo fans, we bought two dinners to sit side by side controlling the living room and dining room. Our house was built in the 50s so we were lucky that these switches were not ends of circuits, as most of the switches in our house are, because constant power is necessary for the dimmers to work. They both fit easily into the small metal outlet box clearly made for smaller switches as it was a 2 inch deep box. Wiring was fairly simple. The directions were clear, we just had to connect all the neutrals together as we were wiring two switches. They both set up quicker than any other wemo product we own, recognized immediately be the app and added to our devices. It took under 1 minute to configure both the wemo app and the Alexa app. All in all, we love wemo and love all the new products!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo plugs make life easier!,5.0 ,"This little plug works perfectly with my Amazon Echo. I have 4 Echos all over the house, so they make my house ""smart'! I have one on my nightstand, and my lamp is plugged into this little Wemo Mini. As I am ready to turn the light off and go to sleep, I simply say ""Alexa, bedroom light off""....I don't even have to reach over. In the morning, I ask Alexa to turn the light on. Love it. Great quality. I have 3 of these Wemo plugs in the house and they work great. I bought another brand, as it was cheaper. It was always malfunctioning, and since it was more than 30 days, I couldn't return it. I threw it away, and figured I learned a lesson. Stick with Wemo. We have never had a Wemo fail.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great Smart Switch,5.0 ,"We got this as our first SmartHome device after we got the Echo. I hooked his up to our front porch lights to give us remote control access from the web but also, and this is really first world problems, the light switch is on the other side of house. Now, if we forget to turn it off, I can ask Alexa and she'll turn them off for us. The Belkin app was super easy to setup and use and the WeMo devices work with the Echo out of the box, no additional skill or account linking required. Bottom line - if you're looking for a smart light switch, go with this one. It's expensive for a switch, but the utility it provides is awesome.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
OUTSTANDING PRODUCT! I love these things.,5.0 ,"Just installed this. Was a bit of a challenge in an older house as I had no ground or neutral wire. I'm still not clear how I got it to work. I ended up connecting the ground to the frame of the switch next to it. And the neutral to the wire leading to the lamp on the other switch. (I probably should have hired an electrician, but my previous switch was wired the same way and my house hasn't burned down yet). Once installed, the thing works great. I love the whole product line. I have several of the other devices and hope they come up with some more. I love how it adjusts and synchronizes with daylight savings time without me having to manually program it. I love how I can create programs for every day of the week if I wanted to from my phone. It's so easy to program and change the program. I love how if I don't want to give out candy on halloween and leave the house with the light on, I can remotely turn my porch light off right from my phone anywhere I am. I'm not sure there is a single thing I don't like about the WEMO products. I love them. I wish they had some sort of dimmer version. I think that's whats missing from their product line.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works great for porch and garage light control,4.0 ,"I installed two of these switches side-by-side in a 3 switch box and they've been working great for the last few months. It's tight fit, but all the wiring and connectors fit fine in the switch box. I was able to program these switches to turn on/off my porch and garage lights and they've been working flawlessly. The only small glitch, is that the green circular light on one of the switches is significantly dimmer than the other switch, and it looks a bit strange when looking at the two switches at night. Also, I had a glitch with the Android app which controls all of my WeMo Belkin devices while I was out of town, where it didn't seem to control the switches and lights. When I removed the Android app and reinstalled it, all of the connections and settings to my home devices were lost and I couldn't control anything! It wasn't until I returned home that I could re-setup everything once I connected to my home WiFi with my smartphone. I think Belkin has resolve this issue with an update to the app (also, my wife's iPhone app didn't have this issue). You do need a neutral wire in your switch box for these switches to work. My home was built in the early 1980's, so I did have the required neutral wire. My suggestion is to first look in your light switch box to see if you can find a neutral wire before ordering these switches. I did a Google search first and was able to find many resources explaining what to look for in finding the neutral wire setup.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I love the switch and the WeMo app,5.0 ,"I love the switch and the WeMo app. It seamlessly lets me control 1 switch and 2 sockets in which setup was straightforward and a breeze. I will say that I was bummed out I couldn't put this where i wanted as the original location has a 3 way switch, which for non electricians means a light fixture which can be controlled with 2 switches in different locations such as a light fixture that has a switch at the top and bottom of the stairs. I did read it was possible to add and not replace the WeMo switch to an existing 3 way switch setup however you really need to have above average joe electrician skills to attempt the WeMo switch integration with an existing 3 way switch setup. Frankly I didn't want to risk burning the house down trying to integrate it with the existing 3 way switch so i settled on a location which only had one switch. I turned off the breaker box controlling the switch I was replacing. Unscrewed the wall plate and old switch, tied the existing wires into the Wemo switch with the provided wire nuts, turned the breaker back on and I was ready to control my lights from anywhere in the world in less than 15 minutes after setting up the app.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Good idea crippled by buggy software,3.0 ,"This switch is a cool idea and it's useful, but the implementation is poor. This switch is very useful, particularly because I can turn my lights on or off from my cell phone or my Amazon Echo. I have the switch controlling the lights on my front porch, and it's nice to be able to turn them on when I'm returning from a run or when I have a knock at the door. The usefulness is severely diminished by how buggy both the Android app and the switch software are. The app crashes frequently, and sometimes cannot find the switch for no discernible reason. The switch itself will sometimes refuse to connect to my wifi, and can only seem to store a single wifi network's credentials. I even once had an incident where the switch just stopped working for a few minutes and wouldn't control the lights at all, even when pressed physically. This is an absolutely unacceptable failure state for the device. WeMo, get the app working and fix the switch's wifi issues, and this thing will be a winner.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Does what you need but cheaper equally great alternatives are out there.,3.0 ,I'm torn about WeMo. Its a great product. It does exactly what I want it to do... BUT the TP-Link Smart Plug is significantly cheaper. At the time of this review the Wemo Smart Plug is $35 and the TP-Link Smart Plug is $25. I bought both...and I actually got the TP-Link one when it was briefly on sale for $21 for a short period of time. Both do almost the exact same thing. The only thing that WeMo has over the TP-Link is its a bit smaller and it works with If This Then That (IFTTT). The jack size and IFTTT support don't really mean anything for me. So at almost $15 cheaper the TP-Link is a no brainier. If the WeMo was cheaper I'd be all in.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Worked for a few months until the Wemo Insight Smart Plug died when they pushed a firmware update,2.0 ,"Worked for a few months until the Wemo Insight Smart Plug died when they pushed a firmware update. Besides waiting 10 minutes to connect, I spent a half hour on chat with a support representative redoing all the tests I had already done. Ultimately they replaced the switch, but it was a real hassle and waste of everyone's time. From reading on forums, it is a common problem for firmware updates to brick these devices. Poor design to not be able to avoid this, have a safe mode boot or rollback to previous firmware easily. Then their replacement policy has a tight window to return the unit once you receive replacement, likely causing some consumers to have a full charge for replacement value on their card. Clearly a company that is thinking about the wrong things and not about the customer. It is unlikely I will buy more Wemo devices due to this.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great product, but needs Apple HomeKit integration",5.0 ,"I purchased a Wemo Switch 3-4 years ago. I liked it, but it was a problematic device. The wifi connection was spotty, even though the device was near my home wifi router. When plugged into a two-socket receptacle, the device also blocked use of the open socket (if the plug to be inserted in the second socket was a bit large). I like this new Wemo Mini Plug a lot more. So far, it maintains wifi connectivity. Maybe it has a better internal wifi antenna. I also like the horizontal design of the device, as it leaves more free space around the second outlet. It also costs less than original switch. The major drawback, for me, is that the device will not work with Apple HomeKit. I hope Belkin remedies that soon with a firmware update.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
EXTREMELY HARD AND DIFFICULT setup,2.0 ,EXTREMELY HARD AND DIFFICULT setup with this thing. I had to actually change my router to match the signal that this must have to setup. Setup was extremely hard and took almost 3 hours before I got the thing onto my network. Now it shows that there is a firmware update and I will NOT be updating because god forbid I have to restart this thing. The update was so bad for this product that I had to mark down the rating. Now for what it actually does is pretty awesome I will be using this for my taxes and to help gauge how much electricity I use for my work.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great Purchase,5.0 ,"Love these light switches. I installed one in my kitchen, and one in the living room, both near each other. Installation is quite simple, and directions are quite clear. You DO need to make sure that your wiring has a ground wire, but for most homes this isn't an issue. This comes with some easy to use wire nuts to make the connections. The only difficulty can be that this switch has a fairly good sized box to squeeze into the electrical box in the wall, which can be done, but does take a bit of planning and reorganizing of the wires, especially in a multi-gang switch area. I initially had some trouble fitting this next to a dimmer switch (which has wings on it to bleed off the heat generated more easily). I had to do some research before removing the metal wings on the dimmer switch. Overall, easy enough installation, that even an electrical novice like myself handled without issue. The setup of the switch is not too bad, and runs through the Wemo app. However, you do need to tell your phone to stay connected to the wifi signal generated by the switch (for setup only), since t tries to disconnect when this wifi signal does not allow internet access. Once set up, it will auto update firmware, which sometimes fails, and you may need to help it try again. The Wemo app is a bit dated, but it has been a bit improved since I initially purchased the switch. It still takes too long to open the app directly, and it initially did not have ""widgets"" to allow turning on/off the switches from your phone's main screen (instead of opening the app, waiting, waiting, waiting, and then clicking the button). Now that it has widgets built in, I will note that the widgets sometimes don't update in real time too well (lights will show off when on, etc). This is fixed by opening the app itself which forces a status update. Integrated well into Alexa/Google. Easily found by my Amazon Alexa app, and no linking of accounts needed to get working. I can ask for individual lights to turn on and off, or set groups in the Alexa app. I don't have a Google Home, but my android phone can also control the lights easily. Overall, this is the single BEST aspect of this device, and was worth every penny for this switch. Walk into the kitchen, ask for the lights on, and its done quickly. Especially helpful with full hands or when cooking. Bottom line, I would definitely purchase again. I have even bought 2 additional plug switches for my bedroom, to work with an Echo Dot up there. Great to turn off the lights without having to get out of bed...","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Excellent Smart Home device,5.0 ,This is my fourth WeMo device. The other three are the larger/original WeMos. They have all been in use for over 4 years now. I have had very few issues with them at all. The only issue is making sure you have a good enough WiFi signal where you want to place the device. This was a problem for one of ours that got resolved with a Netgear Orbi. Now that we have full coverage of our home we have no issue with the WeMos. We have them on lamps so that we can turn lights on before we enter a room and turn them off after we leave. We can also turn them on from outside the house to make it look like we are home. The new Mini is even better because it is so much smaller and you could stack two of them on one wall outlet. Which was not the case before.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Good if you can install it. Make sure to have a neutral wire.,3.0 ,"Make sure your outlet has a Neutral wire. There should be two hot wires, a ground, and a neutral.

So Far So Good,5.0 ,"I've only had the Wemo Mini Smart Plug for about a week but so far I am very happy. The setup was a breeze, and if you don't have any knowledge of how computers, phones, or technology works the instructions are very simple and straight forward. I had to fidget with the app for a couple of seconds to figure out how to set multiple timers and how to set specific on/off times but once I did that was a breeze to set as well. It connects well and very useful with IFTTT and Amazon Echo. Overall have nothing negative to say, and a major step up from my old dial and pin timers.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Very pleased with this light switch,5.0 ,"I am a beginner when it comes to wiring but got this completely setup in about 45 minutes thanks to the thorough and clear instructions. I chose this over the competition because it shows an instructional video on Amazon and as a result you know what you're getting into and whether or not it will work on your wall switch prior to making the purchase. Beyond the voice control benefits with Google Home and Alexa which take 15 seconds to enable, I really like how you can create schedules through the app. The android app seemed a little buggy(randomly invoked my camera app) and laggy during the setup but it's not worth knocking this product down a star for that since the app is overall very useful once you are setup.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

"Expensive, Well Designed Switch",5.0 ,"I recently embarked on the journey of technifying my home via Google (and Nest), Wemo, and Hue. After installing several other Wemo switches, I ran across this dimmer and saw two places where I could use one. The increased cost compared to the regular Wemo Light Switch was a factor in my decision to only employ 2. Installation is fairly straightforward if you have a basic knowledge of household wiring. After that, setup and configuration were intuitive. I love being able to control the switch remotely and having the long press as a distinct trigger. The dimmer is aesthetically pleasing, and it's great to know about how bright the lights will be before you turn them on. The light below the switch indicates when a rule is being run or if there's a connectivity error. The price tag is large, but it is still a great value for the money. I have no regrets about this purchase.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
When you can tie into the Home Network they are great,4.0 ,"My wife and I have a hard time getting around the home place. This switch and the other WeMo products allow us to turn things on and off without having to get up. My main concern is that if you have to change your home network password sometimes it can be VERY tricky getting your device to hook back up. Belkin has a lot of Web help for ""Getting Started"" but it falls WAY short on help if you are going to have to reconnect to the home network if something like the password has had to be changed. I have two light Switch controls and six Outlet switches. When the products hook up properly they cant be beat. I have the WeMo app loaded on my Android phone and can easily turn items on and off in the house or through my 3G Cell connection away from the house. Let me clarify - Once they hook up they stay hooked up to your home network. I would give a 4 star rating, but I had to replace two devices that would Never hook back up after I had done a network password change. Most of the devices did and I could log in the new password . I even tried the Factory Reset on my two devices and never could get back into my home network. Now I have two $50 paperweights.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"OK if you just want to automate a few switches, but not for a major home automation project",2.0 ,"I installed a dozen of these and ended up replacing them all with GE-Z-Wave switches. I never could get these to function properly with a SmartThings V2 hub. It almost always showed them offline or else they would function but the status would never change. I tried fixed IP addresses and everything else that other users suggested with no luck. Sometimes they would start working, but then if you did something like reboot your router they would all go out again. I’m giving them two stars because if you just want a few devices to automate and give voice commands with Alexa they are simple to install.

Working great,4.0 ,"Edit 10/12/16: I am raising my previous 2 stars to 4. Connectivity has improved, a firmware update seems to have fixed my previous issues. My Wemo switches have been working flawlessly for the past 3 months. Thank you Wemo for the improvements. I have had 2 Wemo light switches a one Wemo switch for a little over a year. They work ok when they are connected to my wifi network, but every few weeks they lose connection and it takes a day or two to get everything back connected. They are connecting to an Asus RT-AC68 router. I'm not sure if there is imcompatiblity issues with that router but it is giving me issues. Bottom line is when they are connected the rules work fine but I seem to be spending a lot of time reconnecting them.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great when it works. Extremely frustrating when it doesn't.,2.0 ,"First off, I want to say that when the product works, it works great! It is very responsive and records all the stats I care most about. With that said I really wanted to love the wemo insight and in theory it is exactly what I was looking for. I first received the wemo insight as a gift. My first test included plugging it in about 40 feet away from my nighthawk X6 router and attempting to set it up. The switch would see the wifi network but never maintain a connection. I thought this was very strange and thought maybe there was an issue with the device hardware / firmware. I then plugged it into an outlet just 5 feet away from the router. Sure enough, it worked just fine. I found an excuse to use it close to the router and then at christmas I bought 2 more for christmas decorations. I thought it was a fantastic idea to monitor how much money it costs to run all of our decorations. This was yet again another battle. I thought that surely 2 years later, even though they looked the exact same, belkin would have improve the hardware and the new switches should handle the job just fine. I proceeded to set them up less than 20 feet away from the router. I experienced the same problem again and heard myself say the words ""fool me twice - shame on me"". I had an old router and used dd-wrt to setup an access point and positioned it between the insight switch, 10 feet away from each with a low 7 dB antenna. Sure enough they started working again. I hate that I feel compelled to write a negative review because I want this product to work however people need to know that even with a great $250+ router the switches have a terrible time staying connected. I talked with the guy who gifted me my original switch and he reported that his does the same thing and he found his router has to have direct line of sight to work. To further capitalize on my frustration with the product, their android app just does not work well period. It feels like it was first designed for iOS and then ported to android. I've contacted customer support multiple times for various in-app errors and every time I receive a response saying it is device specific issue then they close the ticket. Belkin should learn from the nest app and apply some principles from nest's basic setup process. I really hope other customers consider this when purchasing this switch. I'm heavily into home automation platforms and it is very irritating when I can't depend on on the switches to turn on or off based on the schedules & rules I've programmed. I have a spare littlebits switch and wifi adapter and both together work more reliably than the insight switch. I would most definitely advise anyone considering the insight switch for their smart home to either wait until it is clear they've updated the hardware or purchase a switch from another company. In conclusion, if I could, I would return all 3 switches. I'm not convinced belkin has done anything more than push firmware updates to the same old hardware. I really hope this changes and I can once again trust belkin's wifi radio hardware. Perhaps they should consider moving away from wireless and use Ethernet over power line for communication.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

I had some issues getting it connected to my network but that was due to my phone and Sprint's connection manager, so no problems to associate with WeMo there. I put it down one star because it's BIG and was very hard to install in a standard switch wall box with the standard wiring behind it. This will be a 5 star product when it slims down as technological devices tend to do. Once installed I've loved it though. I do have an issue from time to time that I haven't looked up but if I manage to not push it all the way it goes into a mode where it can't be used for like a minute. Annoying, but doesn't happen if you get a good solid click on it. Works well from the app and I love it so much I've bought a plug switch for my Christmas lights and I'll be putting more WeMo stuff in the house for a future purchase of an Echo. Finish on this switch is very nice and has great appearance.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great gadget.,4.0 ,"I'm a gadget guy and this is definitely a cool little gadget, a bit pricey, but still a cool gadget. It works like any normal light switch would work first and foremost. In addition, you can turn your lights on and off from your smart phone (in my case, iPhone). You can set rules for the light switch, meaning, you can have the light switch programmed to turn on at a certain time of day or turn off at a certain time of day. In this case, I put mine in my garage. I have it come on about 15 minutes to my normal time of departure for work and I have it turn off about 15 minutes after I would normally leave. So basically, I just roll through and the lights are on and they turn off on their own. I also like the convenience of being able to look at my WEMO app on my iPhone to see if I forgot to turn off the garage lights off. As a fail safe, I created a rule to turn the lights off every night at 8pm in case I do accidentally leave them on. It's had a few times where it doesn't connect right away or that the switch doesn't work for about 30 seconds as it goes through a reconnection process. That is a major pain in the butt, however, all the times it works great makes it very valuable to me. In my opinion, it's expensive. For me, a price point of $29.99 would have me buying them for every light switch in the house. But at $45'ish, I'm sticking to the 2 I've purchased.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"A must have, read my review",5.0 ,"First, I just want to say the bulk of one star reviews are at least 6-8 months back from the current date December 2014. There have been many firmware updates for the devices and updates to the app. I think a lot of the problems are user error. I recently visited a friend of mine and quickly noticed he had one. He was quick to say it sucked and it was pointless. After I reset the device and set it up the right way, he was extremely happy and planned to add more. I put one of these at my parents house for the garage and front door lights because they live on an extremely dark street. I set up the lights to come on at sunset and off at sunrise. The lights get the times from the Internet for the local sunset/sunrise times. I've had one of these installed for 3 months now with no issues. I regularly log into their cameras to make sure the lights are on and even will test them from my phone. No problems at all and my dad wants another one for the back yard lights.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Not recommending this product.,2.0 ,"I used to be a big fan of the Wemo Smart Plug, but for the cost of it and the reliability, its fallen out of my favor. I'm currently searching for a new smart plug to control items in my house. The problem I have had with this product is it won't connect to my Wi-Fi. I have attempted several times to reset the device with no success, and any success was later met with the device timing-out. I've rebooted my Wi-Fi, I've moved the device around the house to see if that area of the house just has a bad connection, and I even looked online to make sure I""m setting it up correctly. I tried the Wemo Mini Smart Plug and had the same problem. Only two of the six devices I purchased work. I finally donated the device. I currently have on order a different product which has better review. If this product works better I will replace all of my Wemo Smart Plugs with the new devices. I would have given this product one star, but out of all the Wemo Smart Plugs I purchased, only two of them are still working. I feel if you order six Wemo devices, all six should work. I could see if one didn't but four out of the six is not a good indicator of a good product.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo works with Google but need to update number ingredient in IFTTT,3.0 ,"Used Wemo Dimmer switch with Google Assistant and works as expected. Wemo's product line is stylish and functional. Installation instructions is straightforward and the process itself was a breeze. Important step to remember is the neutral wire must be connected. Connection to the Wemo app was also easy. Found the switch's Wifi relatively quickly. This all works perfectly with the Wemo app. Integration with Google Assistant is not as smooth. Connection with Google Assistant is not immediate. It took many tries for Google to find the Wemo devices. After some time, we gave up on connecting via iOS and connected with Android. Once connected Google Assistant can control the dimmer switch by voice. About 60% of the time, the Google Assistant can not find it which was very frustrating. So we deleted the devices from Google Home and set it up again. This time iOS connected first. It seems the name assigned on the Wemo app needs to be the same name on the Google app. That could be the cause of the unrecognized device. Integration with IFTTT also works as advertised. The rules created works well with Google. I do have a suggestion for the Wemo folks, the dimmer switch is missing the ""number"" ingredient so I can say, ""Hey Google, set the Wemo dimmer at #"". Currently, I believe I would need to set a IFTTT rule for each incremental setting which is painful.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo mini works with IFTTT,4.0 ,"I have this working with the IFTTT app on my iPhone and have had no problems thus far. All I had to do was get the Wemo app on my phone and there is a section for connecting to IFTTT. The update was somewhat glitchy and never finished when I installed a new WIFI network. I had to unplug the mini from the outlet and reinstall it with the new WIFI network. It has worked fine after that. I only have one wemo mini, I have seen reviews where there might be some connectivity problems with more than one mini and I plan on purchasing another later on. I will update my review after testing that out. I have the Wemo mini switch set to turn on a lamp at sunset and it works right on time, perfect with IFTTT.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
like it would work with just Google Assistant,4.0 ,"I needed a new dimmer for my LED lights hoping it would help with the buzzing sound with some of my LED lights, but it didn't. However the buzzing could very well be a problem with the lights itself. I ended choosing these over other ones for design, Google Home compatibility, no hub required, potential for the WeMo product line, and it was on sale. For Google Home, I was hoping this would work with out the actual Google Home hub, like it would work with just Google Assistant, but it doesn't, no fault to these light switches though. Installing was a little difficult since there were two switches in the electrical box I was using and it was already a little cramped with wires. Everything works as it said it would. Kind of fun playing around with them and convenient to have if you don't want to get up to adjust the lights. Hoping WeMo comes out with 3-way switches sometime soon.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I like this product.,5.0 ,"Very simple setup. Works well with my other IoT; I tell Google Home to turn on my coffeepot in the morning, and IFTTT turns it off at 8:30 every morning in case I forget to turn it off before going to work. The shape is good for not blocking both sockets in an outlet. The only thing the shape doesn't work well for is this. Above my kitchen counter, I have an 2-plug outlet with a light switch to the side in the same coverplate. The shape of the mini doesn't work with that switch. I don't imagine Belkin making different form factors unless this becomes incredibly popular, so I just put one of those short 2 to 3 prong adapter plugs and plug Wemo into it so it is spaced out from the wall enough to avoid the lightswitch. I'm using it with non-grounded, 2-prong appliances, so losing the ground isn't an issue.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
So far so good. The only issue I had was during the ...,4.0 ,"So far so good. The only issue I had was during the set up getting the Alexa to recognize it. I have a dual router with bothe 2.4 and 5.0 wireless networks. The Wemo will only connect to the 2.4. Once I realized that I changed Alexa to my 2.4 network. As a separate note to figure out how to change the Alexa network I simply asked her how to change her network, she brought up the menu to select a different wireless SSID and prompted for the password. I also had to go into the Alexa app and add the Wemo skill. Once I did that Alexa recognized the Wemo device and will turn the tv off and on with voice commands. The reason for the 4 stars is that it advertised it works with Alexa but did not provide any info on how to make it work. I had to figure it out on my own.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Attractive, work well",4.0 ,"I've installed several of these around the house, and I love them. They work instantly with the Wemo app, and they work well with both Amazon Echo and IFTTT. The Wemo app lets you set them to come on/off automatically at sunrise/sunset (based on your location) or set times. Easy to install, if your switches have the wires you'll need, including a main. I had to call an electrician to install two in a two-gang box and to fit one into a very small box, but other than that I was able to install them with no problem. (And I have zero experience.) Only downsides: the Echo sometimes fails to detect them or control them instantly. They also make an audible click sound when you turn them on/off. Also, if you lose wi-fi (or they drop the signal), you can't use them for a few minutes when they're searching for a signal. (Once they fail to find a signal, you can use them like standard light switches.)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Not Apple home-kit friendly, but you won't care.",5.0 ,"I originally used iHome smart plugs in my home, but have been less than satisfied with them. The wifi connection is often lost and I must reset the plugs. I find that Wemo's lack of HomeKit compatibility is no big deal, since Alexa is far superior at home automation than Siri anyway, and Wemo is also IFTTT-friendly. And the Wemo app works just fine on iPhones; you just don't get integration into Apple's Home app. I also -really- like that the Wemo app allows you to not only set up events based upon local sunrise/sunset, but to set events for X minutes before/after sunrise or sunset each day. Turn the lights on a little -before- it gets dark each evening.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
A little bit disappointed...,3.0 ,"Works as advertised....HOWEVER !!!!! I could not use where I wanted to, due to my wiring configuration There is no safe way to install this switch if you do not have neutral wires to connect to, as far as I know. My light switches in most of my rooms were installed at end of run/circuit. No neutrals existed in ""gang box"". Read instructions in specs. (download)...it is misleading somewhat, in that you think you can wire this switch without neutral wire...when you receive switch, instructions then let you know you cannot. Luckily I found one light that I could install this switch, but not where I wanted. Also, during activation of wi-fi, you have to connect to WEMO wi-fi address, it froze for a LONG period of time, but finally did whatever it was supposed to do. I bought this to use with Amazon Echo, and it does work with Alexa, and it also works with the app you have to download (WEMO)...alarms/timers whatever. Repeat, make sure you have neutrals to connect to or you will have spent a lot of money for nothing or have to send it back. I read reviews where someone had their switch catch fire, I assumed they connected improperly due to not having neutral wires to connect to. Also, if you have an older home, your gangbox may be too small, when it comes to trying to cram all the connections and wirenuts and WEMO switch into gangbox. Be safe with this item.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
So easy to install a caveman can do it!,5.0 ,"I currently have 7 Wemo units, 5 of the old style and 2 of the new Wemo Mini. There are 2 things to note about the Mini, they take up less space when plugged into socket and they are twice as fast when connecting to the Wemo App. I plan to replace my other units as time goes by, so I can use both sockets. The other reason I like the Mini is the cost, they are a third to a half the cost of the original units. I also feel the response time between telling Alexa to turn off the Bedroom light is much faster that the older units.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great Device, Craptacular App",4.0 ,"Alrighty. I would give this product five stars, but one star gets knocked off for WEMO's app. The light functions wonderfully, but the app is utter garbage. Yes, it's not the switches fault, but considering you need the app to set these up, their fates are intertwined. The app will turn lights on and off remotely on command, but forget about scheduling them or even integrating with a NEST. NEST controls are wonky at best, and the lights will never follow the schedule you set, often turning on and off at random. My fix was a spare netbook I had lying around and this Windows program: [...] The program allows you to control your WEMO devices through a GUI or Windows command line. With that, I was able to set the Windows Task Scheduler to turn the lights on and off on a schedule. SOMETHING THE APP SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Easy to setup and works well,5.0 ,"I have a few of the Wemo Insight, which also work well, but I like this design because its size allows me to use both outlets on the wall, unlike the larger Insight, which requires me to use a surge protector to make use of both outlets. The product was easy to set up using my iPhone and it does not regularly fail to connect (unlike other light bulbs and other ""smart"" devices I have used from other companies). I will note that I have excellent wifi throughout my house, which I am sure helps. I have owned the 4 Wemo Insights for approx 7 months at the time of this review and two Wemo Minis for a little over 2 weeks.

Fantastic Compact Device,5.0 ,"I own a WeMo smart light switch and love it, a Kasa Smart Plug, and now this little guy, the WeMo Mini Smart Plug. It works as described, the setup is a breeze, and it functions wonderfully with Alexa and through the WeMo app for iPhone, but the aspect that truly separates this product from my Kasa plug (which works just as well) is its smart design. It's not a clunky plug that will force you to sacrifice another outlet or rearrange your power source setup--it simply fits. Granted, for the more advanced electrical traidsman, a flush mounted, hardwired smart outlet is clearly the most visually appealing means of building the smart home, but for the average user or individuals wanting to move his or her smart divide around from time to time or for a quick travelers feel-at-home setup, this plug gets the job done. I'll also note, having collected multiple WeMo devices now, I'm very pleased with the household management capabilities through the iPhone app. It's visually appealing, intuitive, and efficient. And again, this does work with Alexa. Just setup your plug, then give Alexa a shout to ""discover devices."" She finds your new WeMo the first time and learns whatever custom name you've given it. Great hands free control of your home.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great starter for automation,4.0 ,"Easy enough to install, turned off all the power to the house just to be on the safe side. Did have some issues connecting it to my wifi, had to power cycle my router before it would work. I was then able to connect it to the Echo Dot and so far liking it. I am trying this switch first which is the porch light at the front of my house so on those occasions when not home I can still turn on and off again for the appearance that I am home. I am hoping this thing lasts with no serious issues so that I can then add additional switches. I did add a outlet switch and kind of cool being able to walk in and turn lights off in a dark room with just my voice. So far very happy with the unit and hope it continues to impress as I am looking to automate most of my house.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Needs to come down in price, but good product.",3.0 ,"The bad thing is now it is $50 to buy one, and not $35 when I bought it. When it goes back down in price I will consider purchasing more. To me it's not worth more than $35. I bought one back in September 2015 with my Amazon Echo. It is awesome to turn on the lights just by askin Alexa too. So far no problems, it works great. It is easy to install. You do need to have some idea of how to work your internet connections. Some people on these reviews here state they have problems with connections. Most likely they have slow internet speed (low Mbps) and the device does not get a great connection.

Wemo smart devices are good once setup,4.0 ,"I started with Wemo Smart Plug(bigger version) in Dec 2016 and was fairly happy with its basic functionality but always thought if it could be smaller so it won't block the other socket. I then came across Wemo mini Smart Plug and bought one. The initial setup was a bit longer as it took 15 minutes and multiple iterations to detect and connect to my Wifi network even though I was in the same room where the Wifi router was. And I have a high-end router from ASUS (RT‑AC87R Wireless‑AC2400). So I was a bit disappointed about how long it took to connect However once connected, it works like a charm both from Wemo App from my iPhone 6S as well as from Alexa. Once initial setup was done, it automatically prompted and downloaded the latest firmware updates. I'm very happy I did buy them that I added two more. I didn't go for TP-Link or similar smart switches only because it is easy to manage all 3 Smart Plugs in one Wemo App than having to maintain two or three different Apps. Perhaps Belkin/Wemo should work on improving the setup time and hope to see a stable connection to my Wifi network. I recommend this to anyone looking for a smart-home. Update 07/06/2017: I purchased one more Wemo product, the WiFi Dimmer switch. It took 10 minutes for wiring the Wemo WiFi Dimmer switch. However, the initial setup took more than 2 hours where the Wemo App was having a lot of difficulties finding and connecting to my WiFi network even though I was in the same room where the WiFi router was located. It was really frustrating when the App asked me to calibrate the Dimmer brightness setting for each iteration. One or two times it did find and connect to my WiFi network but later got stuck when detecting the Wemo device. Then I figured out the reason Wemo App got confused was due to the existing Wemo smart devices already connected (4 mini plugs and 1 Light switch). I disconnected all existing Wemo devices from the outlet and had only the new Dimmer switch hooked up and thus time the Wemo App could connect to my WiFi network and detect the device quickly. Once connected the Dimmer switch worked nicely. Belkin technical R&D team should really fix this frustrating setup issue. Hence I knocked down one star. I knew this setup problem so I didn’t give up and return the switch as faulty. I’m sure many would have already returned thinking the device is defective.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"VERY EASY SET UP, AND VERY CONVENIENT.",5.0 ,"VERY EASY SET UP, AND VERY CONVENIENT. Just look at the VERY SIMPLE picture have for the physical connection and it is fast and easy to install. You might have to push the power wires as much as you can in the box because the back of the switch is kind of bulky. Just connect to the wireless signal it created and from the app you can connect to it and set it up. After that Alexa picked it up right away. Cons: The only one I noticed it that it made me lazier, it is so convenient to just tell Alexa to turn off the lights the kids left on, that now I don't like turning off the lights that are not connected. I now want to connect all my lights to it.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great Product! Reasonable price. UPDATE: Recommendations for connection issues.,5.0 ,"UPDATE: For those who have issues after firmware updates, you may be having the same trouble I had. My Netgear router uses an optimization that automatically chooses 2.4 / 5 ghz bands. These switches are 2.4ghz only, so if your router is like mine and decides to switch the band, they most likely will stop working. Turn this feature off on your router and create 2 networks. Assign your every daily devices, including these switches to 2.4ghz and your optimized devices (streaming devices) to the 5ghz band. Both the Amazon Echo and the WEMO switches are now on 2.4ghz and we've had no problems since. First: I'm not sure where the negative reviews come from. We've had 7 of these switches installed in our home for 6 months or more and have had nearly zero issues. Installation can be finicky, but once connected to Wi-Fi and the firmware updates, these,things are great. We control ours from an Amazon Echo. Would highly recommend Wemo switches.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great design, great app, well-built",5.0 ,"Everything I've bought from Belkin has been well-made and durable. I've never received a faulty cable or device from them. This plug has a nice slim design fits great in a power strip. This is my 2nd Wemo device. The other is the Insight switch. Both are really easy to control with the Wemo app. Haven't tried them in any other apps, or with Alexa. I like having the button on the adapter so my guests don't need the app to turn on the power. I use mine as a remote switch for my Grandfather's old hi-fi stereo. With this remote switch and an airport express plugged into the Aux input, I can turn the 1973 McIntosh on and stream Pandora into it without going near the cabinet. Grandpa gets a kick out of that!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works great after you get it to connect. Read this review for wifi connection problem resolution.,4.0 ,"Once you figure out how to set it up, it works great. Getting it to connect to your WiFi is more of a chore than it should be, though. The trick: do a hard-reset as soon as you open the package. To do this (according to included directions) you hold the power button down while plugging it in and continue to hold it until the status light blinks white. I have four of these and three of the four required this in order to get the wifi to connect. Before I did this, it would detect my wifi but was unable to connect after entering my password. I tried four half an hour with the first one before I did the reset I mention above. After that, it connected and has worked fine since. So, long story short: Open the box, do a hard-reset, and then follow the setup directions.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"WeMo Mini -- Tough Start, But Great Since",4.0 ,"The initial set up was fairly simple -- plug it in, download the app and in a minute you're ready to go. Then the Wemo immediately wanted to download and install a firmware update. Which seemed great. Six hours later we were still in the process of downloading and installing the update. The good news . . . once the update was finally complete, the Wemo has connected and functioned perfectly. Hopefully the hardware/software update delay was just a one time glitch. We will definitely add more Wemos to our growing smart home. Love the size of the Mini, the scheduling flexability and that the app is almost instantaneously responsive for turning on/off.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Best bang for your money.,5.0 ,"This is a great item for less the cost of the first generation. It is very easy to set up with your wifi. You do not have to assign any variables to it as you would for other devices. Just down the app, and it walks you through the entire procedure. I am able to control several devices in my home. Setting up timers or have them manually turn on through your app, whether you are home and away. Above all, it does not cover your second outlet like the first generations do. I have owned wemo for three years now, and they are all going strong. Not one problem at all.

Intermittently loses connection with Alexa,2.0 ,"AFter having these firr a few months now, i am reducing my star rating from 4 to 2 Pros: Looks great. Love the look of the on/off indicator. Functions very well as a standalone light switch. I like the tactile response of the on/off Cons: #1 biggest issue: It does not respond to Alexa 100% of the time. 50% times it's slow at responding, 10-20% of the time it doesnt respond at all to Alexa. I bought this product solely to have Alexa integration. So, not having it work 100% of the time and lagging half the time will not cut it. #2: The Wemo app is slow and often unresponsive or crashes. Paring the device with the app also takes too long. Some times the devices show as offline inside the app even though they are constantly connected to wifi (could be the reason why Alexa doesnt detect them either). I just bought the TP-link light switch to test out in my bedroom since that's where i have my echo Dot. It works SOOO much better. Instant response with Alexa. 100% of the time. Pretty usre that TP-link is much more experienced at building Wifi products than Belkin is. Now I am just trying to decide whether i should bite the bullet invest the money to replace the 3 Wemo switches i have already installed around my living room. For the time being, I will definitely be staying away from Wemo products","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Nice but needs work,3.0 ,"Received 2 WeMo minis yesterday. First one setup with no problems. Second one was a real pain. It kept saying connection failed no matter where I put the plug. Close to the router, away from it, near my phone, away from it, didn't matter. After about 10 times of cycling between the Wemo Wi-Fi and my home Wi-Fi I unplugged the first Wemo and tried again, this time it connected and setup with no problem. Plugged the first one back in and there they both were. Then it said there was a firmware upgrade required. The second Wemo took an hour to upgrade, the first ran all night and still showed upgrading. Out of frustration I turned off the app and unplugged the Wemo, plugged it into the outlet where the other was plugged in and started the app. Then it showed upgrade complete. Go figure! Then there are the rules. These are the applets the app uses to turn off and on at specified times. When I click on the rules icon it takes about 5 minutes of ""looking for rules"" before it comes up. So after the second Wemo had upgraded I set a rule for it to come on at 5:45 am. When I got up this morning it wasn't on and when I looked in the rule it wasn't there . On the plus side Alexa had no problem detecting both plugs. The Wemo is a great concept and I like that the Mini is small enough that you can still use the other outlet, but they still have some work to do to make it really user friendly and frustration free.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Problem Solved!,5.0 ,"I've had a wemo plug for 6 months and 2 minis for a week. I love them! I have a big house, and most of my lights are on occupancy sensors. But my problem was that if no one was home, the house was dark and you could tell no one was home from the street. So, I put 3 lights on regular timers. I already had to adjust the timers when the days get shorter, longer, or the time changes. If the electricity went out I had to adjust them again. What I like best about the new mini plugs, is I have them set up to turn on at Sunset plus 15 minutes for one, and Sunset for the other. One goes off at 11:30 Pm and the other at midnight. The time adjusts automatically. Problem solved.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Fixed IP seems to fix wifi signal connection loss,3.0 ,"I purchased 7 switches, had them professionally installed. All was ok until the following morning. Half of my switches had lost connection. I spent 1hr on the phone with tech support....I must say they were very patient with me. After Rebooting, updating and reinstalling, we finally got them all up and running. I have confirmed that I am connected to a 2.4 gigahertz access point. Each unit is fully updated and my app has the most current version. Well not an hour after doing this....I started to lose connection with one of the switches, so I took matters into my own hands. I gave each switch a static IP address. Believe it or not that seems to have solved the issue. All the switches have remained on line, the wemo app sees them all as do my Amazon echo units.

If they fail again, I will downgrade and probably uninstall them.......","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I'm torn,3.0 ,"I loved the idea behind this light switch, use existing wi-fi to control lights or other electronics in your home when you're not there and that can be accessed via android app. Great idea. The light switch is hard to review, it's a light switch and it works fine, touch once for on and once for off after you've installed it correctly and it has a nice unobtrusive green led that glows that can be seen across the room if you’re looking for it but otherwise doesn’t draw attention. Installation was quick and easy my biggest issue wasn't with the light switch but with the painters that managed to cover everything inside the box with paint making all the wires the same color as the walls. Again, no problem with installation or the light switch itself. The light switch gets 5 stars. The interface though, the interface is horrible. The programming team for the android app needs to be drawn, quartered, and then fired. If I were rating the android app I couldn't do it because you can't assign negatives or even zero stars and the app doesn't deserve even a one star review. I bought two light switches to use to control my front and back porch lights figuring I’d set them up using the timer setting the same way I use the two plug-in timers controlling a couple of table lamps. When I saw that I could set the light switches to turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise, I thought, “that’s fantastic no need to adjust for changing seasons” and used those settings instead. Only one problem, they don’t work. Used both the “Turn on” and “Turn off” setting choices in the android app. Nothing. The light switches work, I can use them to turn the lights on or off by either pressing the switch itself or their icons in the android app, it’s just that they don’t respond at all to the sunset/sunrise timer option. I would try using the standard timer option, that is turn on at time X and turn off at time Y, but currently the android app won’t show me the Rules I’ve set up in the android app so I cannot edit those settings. Even though I cannot see my Rules, the timers on my table lamps continue to work as I programmed them. While it’s convenient that my table lamps continue to turn on/turn off according their programming, frustrating doesn’t begin to describe my dissatisfaction with the android app (I’ve no experience with the apple app). Oh, and one other thing in the interface, if you change the turn on time, you’ll have to change the turn off time because for some idiotic reason it defaults to “turn off 1 hour after turn on”, so if you’re changing turn on time to account for changing seasons but want to keep the same turn off time, you’re out of luck.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Easy set up and syncing with Echo,5.0 ,I ordered the wemo smart plug along with a t-p link smart plug. After spending hours unsuccessfully getting the t-p link smart plug to connect I attempted the wemo. It was easy peasy to not only set up but to sync with my Amazon Echo. The whole process took ten to fifteen minutes including downloading of the wemo app. I love having the ability to tell Alexa to turn off my bedroom lamp without sitting up and fumbling for the switch when I am sleepy. If you have doubts on this take it from me. It is super easy. I will be returning the t-p link plug and purchasing more wemo smart plugs. Thank you wemo for making this sixty three year old lady very happy!,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Pretty cool, has some flaws",4.0 ,"Does what it says. The good: It's really convenient to be able to turn your porch light on while driving home. It's definitely the future. I'd imagine within 20 years all new homes will be built with all wifi controllable light switches. App is simple and no filler. Wifi setup was easy. The bad: Install is a little tough because the switch is so large it makes a really tight fit in the wall box. It takes several seconds for the phone to connect with the switch, and a few more for the switch to be toggled after pressing the button. It can take 10 seconds to open the app, wait for connection, and turn the light on/off. That may not sound like long, but it's long enough to be annoying. Think about clicking a web link and having to wait 10 seconds for the page to load. It's like that. Finally, the switch itself is not a traditional toggle switch. It's a push button. After flipping light switches up and down my whole life, it's really hard to get used to. I've had this for several months and I still try to flip it up to turn it on as opposed to pressing it in most of the time. I really wish it was a toggle switch. In summary, at this price (~$40) I'd buy these for all my home's light switches if the app worked faster and the switch was a toggle instead of the annoying push button. As it is with it's flaws, it'd take a price drop before I buy any more. It's neat, but not $40 neat. Make it $20 and I'll buy a dozen of them.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great for security and energy saving!,5.0 ,"I now have 3 of these, I started with 1 and after I fell in love ordered more. I have them on my outside lights and one inside light. I tend to hate walking up to my door in the dark and don't want to waste electricity leaving the porch light on all day in the winter. I started using this and hitting the on button as I got close to my house. For a while I had trouble with the connection dropping all the time then I realized it was my router placement, after moving that 2 inches it fixed the problem and now they never lose connection. The install was really easy as I have limited experience in electrical. the only problem I ran into was from my home builder having way to many neutral wires in one little twisted cap thing. I love that I can tell Amazon Echo to turn on and off my front porch or back porch light if I am taking the dog out. I can see a future where these are all over the house.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Very useful device and fun to use,5.0 ,"I have seen these devices on the market for a long time, and have always told myself that they are not that useful (am I too lazy to walk to the switch and turn it on/off myself?). This easy to install device has changed my mind, it is useful. I have the switch setup to automatically turn on the front porch light at sunset, and off at sunrise. It works! I love it! I'm also able to use my Amazon Echo to turn the light on/off by voice command. I am very impressed with the fact that I did not need to also purchase a special hub to get this device working; It works with my WiFi router, no additional hardware required. That was a big purchasing point for me. IMHO, The Android app is very easy to use, although I don't think the rule creation screen is very intuitive. It took me a few tries to understand how to correctly make a rule. The app also makes it very easy to connect with IFTTT, which I have done. I'm now searching around my house for additional opportunities for WeMo device use, I already have a few more in mind. :) I will be attending the 2015 AllSeen Alliance Summit in Seattle; I would love to see WeMo supporting AllSeen/AllJoyn over WiFi.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
A smart plug that switches lamps with fingertip or verbal command,5.0 ,"I was somewhat alarmed at the number of negative reviews of the Wemo mini smart plug switch. I decided to take it slowly, ordering one or two at a time. I now have six with a seventh coming. Set up was effortless. The process of connecting to Wi-Fi, naming the switch, connecting to Alexa, setting up single lamps, joining a group, and testing it took five minutes for the first lamp and with practice now takes three minutes. I easily set up groups of lamps controlled by a single command. I have not tried timed lamps but it looks simple. I have not tried IFTTT. I did not download the firmware update since everything was working. However, I did try causing trouble. I unplugged a switch and plugged it back in. I changed the name of a switch. I turned off the Wi-Fi and then turned it back on. I set up switches on different floors of the house than the router or the Echo. At no time could I get any of the switches to fail. The oldest one I have is less than two weeks old, so there is the possibility of failure in the long run. Otherwise I am truly baffled at why some people have had so much trouble. Update: I ordered two more plugs, numbers 8 and 9. This time I had problems. They would not detect the Wi-Fi. I recycled the plugs and the Wi-Fi to no avail. I unplugged all of the previous 7 plugs, as recommended by another reviewer, but still could not get the new ones to connect. I tried several more times over a period of six hours. I saw why others gave up at this point but i was encouraged to persist because the first 7 worked. Suddenly the new ones connected. I'm truly not sure why. However, a month has gone by and all 9 are operating perfectly. Once again I recycled the Wi-Fi and unplugged the plugs but could not get anything to fail. Clearly these plugs have quirks, but now everything works: Alexa, the Wemo app and the rules. My only sure advice is to persist and you will be rewarded with eventual success.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Long live WEMO and laziness!,5.0 ,This dimmer was unbelievably easy to install and it is really easy to use with my WEMO app or with Alexa (Amazon Echo). I really needed a dimmer for my dining room chandelier which uses xenon gas bulbs (BRIGHT!). Now we can get just the right amount of light for the right time of day and occasion. I also installed one of these in my living room because I am lazy and can just adjust the light from the couch. I also have them programmed to turn on in the morning just before I come down to get ready for work. I am glad I didn't buy the last iteration of the WEMO light switches because the dimmer function really makes this product shine.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Good physical design, but weaker wifi connection than older models",3.0 ,"This is a great update for the Wemo plug. The physical design of this update is far superior to the bulky older version of the smart plugs. The only issue i have is that at least in my case, the two i bought to add to my smart home seem to have a weaker connection to wifi networks. I originally bought this one to add my aquarium lights to my smart home set up. The problem was that both of the smart plugs i purchased couldn't dependably maintain a connection to the wifi from inside of the cabinetry. Then just switched in one of my older model Wemo plugs and that just works just fine. Then i used the newer ones in place of where I had the older plugs beforehand. These things can be wonderful, depending on placement.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo App Needs Total Rework,3.0 ,"Setup (minus 1 star) Setup in a nutshell is a pain. It seems that in a highly populated wireless area the setup doesn't want to lock on to the strongest signal. It just sits there searching for a network. After reboots, restarts and unintall, reinstall attempts the switches were finally found. Once you get that far, setup is fairly simple. The App (minus 2 stars) After setup the Android app refuses to find the switches even though Amazon's Echo finds them every time and they are listed in the router's connected list with a very strong signal. Unfortunately you can't change your rules for the switches via Echo. So if you wish to change the on/off rules you need to uninstall the app, reset your switch and start fresh. This should never be needed once the switches are first detected. Support (minus 1 star) I contacted support to see if there was anything I could possibly be doing wrong. I described the fact that the switchs have an IP address and do exist on the network but the app could not find them. The response I received was obviously a canned response telling me to uninstall/reinstall the app and reset the switches. That again, is something that just should never be needed. All in all if the Android app worked the first time, every time, these would be a viable automation solution. But it seems to be hit and miss. Belkin should scrap their current Wemo app and start fresh to get something that works without the hassles. Ideally the app should be able to accept manually entered IP addresses to eliminate the automated search for new switches. I'll be keeping the switches only because they can be controlled by Amazon Echo every time. The Belkin Wemo app is worthless and I dread the day I might want to change the on/off rules for the switches. UPDATE: 11/7/2015 ----------------------------- Belkin released updates to the firmware for the switches and to the Wemo app. Since that release the app seems to be working almost perfectly. The number of times it can't find the switches and dropped dramatically and hasn't been a problem since the update. Because of this I've restored 2 stars to my review.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works well but with a couple quirks,4.0 ,"Wonderful little item that I installed myself for our front porch light. I can control the lights with my iPhone remotely and I can set a timer on it too so that it turns on at my desired time and turns off at my desired time. There's also a setting for turning it on whenever the sun sets and turns off when the sun rises based upon the local time. Here in lies one of the quirks: 1] The automatic timer based upon your local time doesn't work perfectly. After setting the WeMo to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise, I notice that this doesn't happen at the right time. For example, the light would turn on an hour before sunset occurs and the light would turn off even an hour before sunrise. I notice when I turn off the automatic setting and then immediately turn it back on then the automatic timer would turn on/off at the appropriate time. But by the next day, the WeMo is back to turning off an hour before sunrise and turns on and hour before sunset. A minor detail but an issue nonetheless. Seems like it should be an easy fix for Belkin. 2] This WeMo is thick! It barely fit inside our wall receptical. I bought a second WeMo for our bedroom but I couldn't install it because it was too big. Buyer beware. Overall, I really like this WeMo!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Works great, router compatibility is a problem",4.0 ,"I bought three of these to replace the switches controlling my outside house lights. The selling point and feature I wanted is the scheduled on/off. I wish I could say installation was a breeze. Wiring these in was pretty easy (even considering two of them were wired in series with a 3-way switch)., but they refused to connect to the router I have (setup fails, every single time). I'm still not sure what the compatibility problem is, but hours of troubleshooting would not get these to work with my router, although I suspect it has something to do with the version of WPA these use. My frustration was compounded by the fact that my router is ISP provided and the settings I have access to from the web interface are limited. I have the technical ability to access the advanced interface not intended for customers, but I can't imagine a typical customer would. I ended up having to pull out an old router and put it in bridge mode, specifically to connect to these. They work now (and are awesome) but I'm running two separate wireless routers, a setup I consider to be a nearly unacceptable workaround to make these switches work. Integration with Alexa works fine, with the expected caveat that you must specify which light you are talking about by whatever you named it when you set it up, so try to avoid being too creative or complex with your names if you intend to use this feature (i.e. ""front garage porch right side light"" is not a good name). Connection issues aside, these are pretty cool.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great support, a few problems at first, now everything is fine",4.0 ,"After I installed my Wemo light switch, I used the Wemo app to create a rule that was supposed to turn the light on 30 minutes before sunset, and another rule to turn it off after sunrise. The light actually switched on and off an hour before it was supposed to. I contacted Belkin support. They walked me through resetting the switch. That did not solve the problem. It still turned on an hour early at night and off an hour early in the morning. Apparently, the switch did not recognize daylight saving time, even though the app did. When I reported the continuing problem to Belkin, I was given a return authorization. Installing the switch had been difficult because it was in a double switch box. In order to avoid having to remove the defective switch, install my old dumb switch, and then reinstall the replacement switch, I bought another Wemo light switch to swap out with the defective switch. I had planned to buy a second switch, anyway. I then returned the defective switch, at a cost $14.50. However, the new switch had the same problem as the ""defective"" switch - it turned on and off an hour early. When I received the replacement switch, I installed it at a different location, only to discover that it, too, turned on and off an hour early. After conferring with a higher level of support, I learned this was a known problem and Belkin engineers were working on a firmware update. They agreed to pay back the $14.50 it cost me to send in the switch. While I am waiting for the firmware update, it is easy enough to work around the problem by changing the ""rule"" in the app so it tells the switch to turn on and off an hour later than what I actually want. I assume I will have to change the rule when we go off daylight saving time, unless Belkin fixes the firmware by then. Belkin's support team has been excellent. The firmware problem is not their fault. That said, so far I have not been unduly impressed by the hardware. Now I am having additional problems with the replacement switch. I use IFTTT to log when the switch turns on and off. Last night the log said the switch turned on at 7:06 pm, but the light did not actually come on. Tonight the log said the light switched on at 6:35 pm. I don't know when it actually turned on, but I have no idea why it chose 6:35 pm. I am hopeful the firmware update will straighten all this out. I would have given a rating of two stars, but the support team earned Belkin an additional star. UPDATE 9-20-14: After a couple weeks, the replacement switch failed completely. Support was again helpful, although it did take me awhile to convince them I could not test or reset the switch. It was a brick. It did not respond in any way to electricity. Anyway, once we were over that hurdle, they sent me another replacement, this time at no cost except for the time it took me to pack up the defective one and take it to a UPS drop-off office. I just received the new replacement, which I have installed. We will see how things go. UPDATE 10-3-14: When I installed my second replacement switch I had to update the firmware for both my switches. This apparently temporarily broke their connection with IFTTT. After a few days, the connections seemed to reappear. The second replacement switch controls the back porch light. Two days ago, that light started flickering on and quickly off. Then it went off completely. The switch showed no lights. I reset it, and it worked for a few minutes, and then went out again. I reset it again, and it has worked since. I am concerned that it might go out again, since the whole reason I bought it was to be sure our porch light turned on and off while we were gone. UPDATE 12-1-14: It's two months since my last update and both of my switches have been working fine. UPDATE 7-4-15: No problems in the last 8 months. Both switches are working perfectly. I have upped my rating from 3 stars to 4.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great Idea, Inconsistent Performance",2.0 ,"I love the idea of a WiFi capable switch. In theory, this is a great idea: control the switch via smartphone, set schedules, great design. However, the execution falls flat. The aesthetics of the switch are great. It appears to be solid and well-built. The large switch looks stylish, and the LED indicator is a nice touch. It catches the eye of anybody visiting my house for the first time. It has a nice feel when you click the switch to manually turn the light on or off. I can't fault the physical characteristics of the switch at all, given the price. The app is okay (Android version). It's not a great design, but it's organized and full featured. I'd prefer it looked a little more modern, but it suffices. Where the execution falls flat is performance. Manually turning the switch on or off works fine. Even turning the switch on or off via the app works fine. The ""rules"" or scheduling engine is sporadic, at best. I've tried to set the switch up to turn on at a certain time in the evening and turn off after a few hours when we usually go to bed. I can't figure out what schedule the switch is actually following, but it's not the one that I tried to set. Sometimes the switch turns on at 7PM as scheduled. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the switch turns off at 11PM as scheduled. Sometimes it doesn't. Quite often I find the switch on at 7PM, but off by 9PM. Also quite often, I find the switch still on at midnight, or even worse, 7:30AM when I'm heading out the door to go to work. It's just flat out inconsistent. I've tried to fix the issues with the schedule by setting it up as one rule (On Until) or two rules (On At, Off At). Neither setup seems to make a difference. I've checked the WiFi signal at the switch. It's strong. The switch is installed in a plastic junction box as recommended. I've updated the firmware. Nothing seems to resolve my issues. All in all, the product is okay if all you're looking for is a switch that you can control manually or remotely via a smartphone or tablet. If you're looking for something that gives you those features plus the ability to schedule on/off times, you might be better off looking elsewhere.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
You have a cool product. Looks nice,5.0 ,"UPDATED REVIEW: Belkin does seem to have fixed many of the firmware bugs, thank you.... As well as adding a few new nice features like 'Countdown Timer'. My wall switch turns on at dusk and now turns off at EXACTLY 12:30 without creep, and I added a second Wemo Switch to control my whole house fan in combination with IFTT's ""DO"" button. Press the do button on my iphone, fan runs for 30 minutes. No need to drop wiring from the attic into the wall to install a conventional timer switch. ------------- OK Belkin.... You have a cool product. Looks nice, great functionality, serves a purpose. How about FIXING your firmware and customer support departments? Extremely frustrating that allowing the switch to update to current firmware versions actually reduces it's reliability. A product with software that becomes more buggy and problematic over time is not a good business model. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. On-at-sunset-off-at-specific-time seem to be particularly problematic for the switch, but honestly that's really it's best capability if it works properly. Also, lots of time drift (12:30 p.m. turn-off becomes later and later every night). It is baffling that an internet connected device can't keep accurate (or even semi-accurate) time. Belkin CSR's are completely clueless, both on the phone and online. The ONLY troubleshooting trick they ever seem to recommend is 'erase/reset everything, reprogram everything, wait until the next day and see if that works;.

"Good product, and great design",4.0 ,"Good product, and great design. Step and configuration was easy and their app was great. I used this as a timer for my Christmas tree and outdoor lights (via an extension cord that went into the garage, as these are not rated for outdoor use). They worked great for that and the timer setting worked extremely well with options to turn on when the sun goes down (it knows the time from the web). I only gave this product 4-stars because it is a wifi product and I want to limit the number of smart devices I connect by wifi so as not to overload my router and wifi network. I have since gone to a dedicated Sansung SmartThings hub and will be only buying switches in the future that connect to that hub via z-wave or zigby and not by wifi. So I would say that these switches are great for someone who want a few switches without the need to get a smart home hub.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The best smart plug I've found yet.,4.0 ,"I've only had these for a few days, but so far I am a big fan of them. The setup experience was very finicky and leaves something to be desired, but once I had the process that I needed to perform to get setup working on my Pixel XL down, the rest of my smart plugs went smoother. Once setup was complete, I've had no issues with these at all! One thing to keep in mind, don't use them for mission-critical applications (like powering a cable modem) because some things can cause them to turn off--such as firmware updates. I would raise my review to 5 stars if firmware updates kept powered plugs powered during the process.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"So far, so good",5.0 ,"I remember reading most of the reviews on Wemo - the app was buggy, the switches randomly disconnect, the switches don't connect to WiFi, etc. Well, I can say that so far the one switch I've bought has done the job well. I'm using it to function as the main power switch for my A/V setup in my media room. The ability to set rules to turn this off automatically are clutch and I'm sure it will help from in saving on electricity (70"" TV, A/V receiver, cable box, PS4, Amazon Echo, and subwoofer). Setup worked like a charm, was able to rename the switch, and have had no issues with the Wemo app on Android.

Love that we can setup our own rules to turn ...,5.0 ,Bought this to automate our front porch light. At first I couldn't get it to work right...the light was either constantly on or flashing but that was due to me wiring it wrong. None of the wires in my wall were colored and the neutral wire was completely buried inside the wall. After I got the wires sorted out it was a breeze to install and setup. Everything works as advertised. Love that we can setup our own rules to turn on and off the light. The big bonus for me was the ability to use the physical switch just like normal as opposed to the Philips Hue bulbs which you must use the app to turn on or off. Will definitely buy more when the costs come down. Also would love to see a dimming option...either on the switch or at least in the app.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

My WEMOs,5.0 ,"I've been holding off on reviewing these until I used it for a while. I spent a lot of time reading reviews, particularly 1-2 star reviews and was hesitant with my purchase. Now that I've gotten some usage with these I must say that I'm impressed and really glad I made the purchases. The units were relatively easy to install. I agree with a few reviewers that it may be best to hire someone/get a friend to help if you're not comfortable working with your house wiring. Follow the instructions and you should be just fine. I saw a lot of complaints about the software and it appears as Belkin listened. The app is very intuitive and I was able to easily add other devices to the profile to give control to others in my household. The rules option allows you to set on/off times or you can set it to sunrise/sunset and that gives a random setting, especially useful if you wont be at home. I have not utilized the IFTTT pin. Delays in execution of the on/off requests tend to go up if you are not on the same network as the switches (my opinion). I also have a wall wart which works flawlessly. I am really loving my semi automatic home and I whole heartedly recommend this.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo Light Switch on a 3-way switch does work (video link in the comment),5.0 ,I ordered two of these switched on a deal of the day for 30 dollars a piece. Over all the installation was fairly straight forward on one of my switches as it was a single pole switch. That worked great with no issues and setting up the wifi was much easier than on the older Wemo plug in module. My second switch was a 3 way switch to control my exterior lighting to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise. The Wemo packaging states that you can't do this. I thought I would do a quick video of how to install a Wemo Light Switch on a 3-way light switch since I was getting quite a bit of conflicting information on whether you could or could not do this. Well it is possible as long as you only use one of the traveler wires and leave the second switch in the corresponding traveler wire position. In my case this was the down position that corresponded with the red traveler wire. [...] So far this has been working great for me with no issues with either switch. I will be buying more once the price comes back down on either on a deal of the day or black friday etc.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

I have it linked to my Amazon Echo Dot, and the two work together flawlessly. I often utilize the ability to control the various lights remotely and that is very cool. I also have IFTTT recipes in place for my garage lights to switch on when it's dark so that I can see when I get home. They then switch off after I go inside using my location. Very cool!

"Efficient, elegant and has some great looking packaging.",5.0 ,"For the past couple of years, I have been manually powering on and off a wifi extender in another part of my house. I don't like having it on when I go to bed, and would only remember that it was blasting me with radio waves after I was all cozied up. I purchased my Wemo Mini as a means to avoid doing that again. Thinking that it was going to be a huge pain to get working, I held off on setting up my Wemo for about a week after it arrived. Quite surprisingly, it took about 3 minutes to get everything functioning properly (firmware updates and all), and It works like a charm. I couldn't be happier with this product, and I'll even add that the app interface is easy to navigate and incredibly simple to use. Sure, this product enables my laziness, but I am just trying to embrace these futuristic advances in technology.

Meh - Expensive light swith that isnt quite worth the money,3.0 ,"Had quite a few issues keeping this reliably connected to the wifi network. Things would be working fine in the app and then all of the the sudden POOF the WeMo would be ""offline"" and I couldn't manage it anymore. It took doing a manual restart of the device for it to get re-connected to the network and then a separate time it took doing a factory reset to get it re-connected to the network. For as much as this until costs I was expecting a flawless performance (after all, its just replacing a simple $1 light switch in my home). I ended up returning this due to the instability and it was also to big and bulky for my electrical box.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
A great product for my indoor TCP lights,5.0 ,"I had the TCP lighting gateway and bulbs. They worked fine until TCP no longer had cloud support meaning I couldn't use the sunset option for turning on my 4 TCP bulbs. After trying a couple of different gateways that would not connect to the TCP bulbs, I bought the Wemo Mini. It was an easy setup and is not dependent on a gateway. I tried just one at first and I had it going and programmed in about ten minutes. I quickly bought another three. I now have all four bulbs coming on at sunset and shutting off at different scheduled times. I cannot dim the bulbs like with the TCP gateway, but that was not a consideration for me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Worth the price,5.0 ,"This is my second WeMo Smart Plug and want more. They're more useful than I had imagined. I will never leave the house again worried that I've left the curling iron, rollers or flat iron on. You could either set it to auto turn off after an hour or when you've left the house. Other great uses: have a lamp turn on automatically when you get home or off when you've left. Time your Christmas lights to shut off at 10pm. Or have lights turn on and off when you're out of town. So many things you can do! These are pretty easy to set up. The app is basic, but you can do even more with IFTT, Nest and Alexa integration. I like the Mini plug because it allows more room to use the second outlet. Definitely worth the small price tag.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great way to get hooked on WiFi home automation...,5.0 ,"I now have a family of 5 light switches (and growing) and so far no major issues to report. I know how to wire them up so no complaints installing them. The website has plenty of helpful information for those less experienced. The smartphone app is easy to use as is the enrollment of new devices. Remote access is pretty slick - I like showing people how I just turned on my garage lights when miles away. I also like showing them from my driveway. The built in IFTTT programming is great too - some of my lights come on at sundown and remain on for a period of time and then shut off...like I said pretty slick. I even checked in on that from other states. Upsides... - Easy of installation (just make sure you take the proper steps to mitigate getting shocked - open the breaker and tag it out) - Remote access from anywhere you have cell access - Good online info and videos - Easy to use automation scheduling Downsides... - Expensive but coming down lately (now $44 p/ unit) - Tech support chat and phone is no better than what you can get online (I like to delve more into the technology and no-one I contacted could answer the question - how does remote access work when my ISP changes my dynamic IP address???) Hopefully the future brings things like a WeMo thermostat (currently looking at Honeywell but would like to use only one app), 3-way switches, and built in duplex outlets. Overall I love these things and hope the ones I installed last for awhile.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

Can not even tell you how many times I restarted, uninstalled, and repeated. This is being returned. I am not alone, go to the app store and see there are more negative comments that positive and just because of the app! So SELLER/MANUFACTURER why would you not get this fixed! So can't tell you if this product works or not (other than after a gazillion tries it is hooked to my wi-fi) because the app won't work to set it up for programming.

Works perfectly with the Echo! So much fun.,5.0 ,"I've had mine for several months now and I can tell you that most of what people were complaining about has been addressed. My lights work perfectly with the Echo, and the app. We just had a power outage and as soon as my router was up so were the lights. I've had 0 problems with this device. I'm going to be installing more throughout my house. (Update) Since I've written this I have installed about 4 more WeMo devices, including the new dimmer, and I couldn't be happier.

Bad experience for me. Your mileage may vary.,2.0 ,"I had high hopes for this little guy, but it never got a chance to deliver. First, I wanted to install it in place of a tri-pole switch (a light that is operated by two separate switches). It wasn't until I was reading the install instructions in the box that I discovered that it can't be used there. This was disappointing, but not a deal-breaker. I installed this switch after selecting another compatible switch. Install was easy, especially if you have any experience installing switches or plugs. After turning the house power back on the light just kind of flickered. Turned the switch on and off by pressing it, no change. Tried switching bulbs... no luck. I tried to set it up on my home network, but the WeMo app only crashed. Maybe I just got a lemon, but the experience soured me (lemon, soured, get it?) on this product and I returned it. The switch is a great idea, seems well constructed and is easy to install, but mine simply did not work.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Over priced, very poor app and web controls",2.0 ,"I like the concept, and the hardware is ok, but the Apple App stinks to high heaven. I've used apps like Nest and Dropcam, but this app just doesn't cut it. What's wrong with it? Well, most apps start by having you establish an account and then offer a set up and then methods to set up the device to your liking. This app has very few options and in truth, all I want from the device is to occasionally turn on one light where my Dropcam brings in a better picture. This thing wants you to come up with ""rules"" where the light comes on at a certain time and goes off at a certain time. After installation, I was prompted to go to a site called IFTTT -- where I was asked to enter a product registration key. The site wouldn't take the code and I had to re-generate several keys or pins before it was accepted. I'm still at a loss what the second site is for. Why two methods to control the device -- all it generates is confusion. What's more, Belkin does not have an app or website (that I could find) where the device can be controlled by an iMac or Macbook. I bought this for my second home and you can bet I won't buy another for my main home. For me, the device was packaged nice (that's about where Belkin's standard matched Nest) but once out of the box, it's very close to being a piece of junk. Wiring was straight forward and setup wasn't the easiest I've seen, but I managed to muddle through while being delayed by two firmware updates lasting about 20 minutes. Here's hoping some competition comes along to make these devices more functional.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

But it works way more often than it doesnt' and i love being able to walk into my room with hands full and just speak to get my light to turn on!! i only wish this had a dimmer option and then i would rate it 5 stars for all those times i have to ask it to turn on multiple times :)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Wanted to love it, but it is not ready for prime time use",2.0 ,"I really wanted to love this product, but it is just not ready for prime time. For now, I would advise that you hold off purchasing WeMo products until Belkin gets the kinks worked out. I bought and successfully installed four WeMo Light Switches and one Wemo Insight switch and have been using all of them for the past 5 months. I have updated the switch firmware so it is the most current version, and I have updated the app so that it is the most current. Unfortunately, these switches randomly disconnect from my home wifi network. I've had to reset them multiple times. They are simply unreliable. I never know whether I will be able to control them remotely or if I'm going to have to reset them. Also, Belkin hasn't made a PC control available either so you can only control the switches from your phone or tablet. I am often at my PC and would like to turn a light on or off. I finally figured out how to write my own script to accomplish this but the average user without a technology background will not have that option. Their support and documentation is mediocre at best. I love the idea behind WeMo and hope Belkin will get these issues resolved some day soon. For now, I would advise that you hold off purchasing WeMo products.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great internet capable light switch, but has a bug with Multiple Access Point house.",4.0 ,"Finally these are available for a decent price. Ive looked at Insteon and others and they require Smart Hubs and other devices which end up running minimum around $250 just for one switch or outlet. This is $50 or less. Now it is a deep switch, very similar to a digital dimmer module. So you will have to make room in your switch box to make sure there are not a whole bunch of wires with wirenuts directly behind it as it may get in there far enough. I put it in a 3gang box and had to remove all the light switches to make some room by moving some of the wirenuts to the other side (didn't disconnect anything, just had to reposition the wires a little). Then put this one in and got it hooked up and no real issues. Now there is a small firmware/bug I noticed. I have a large house with 4 access points, all on different channels. Now when you configure it for the first time, it would be ok. But I previously already had the app configured when I added two WeMo outlets. And I selected the ""Remember Wireless"" option. Now that seems to cause a problem. Why? Well the outlets were tagging onto a different access point, lets say Access Point A. Well the Wemo Light Switch I got is on the other side of the house, it cant even see Access Point A, it can see Access Point B. Well when you launch the WeMo app on your phone, it seems to keep wanting to try to get the WeMo light switch to connect to Access Point A because it told it to remember the settings. So I ended up having to uncheck that option, then ended up redoing it. Then I noticed it showed the SSID about 3 times since it was seeing different APs. Then I got it working after selecting the one with the strongest signal. So I think they need to update this firmware to fix the bug, instead of remembering the channel number as well on the AP, it should just look for the SSID with the strongest signal.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great smart switch!!!!,5.0 ,"I had a bad bad problem with leaving my porch lights on for weeks at a time. The wemo switch cured that problem. They now pop on at sunset, off around 10pm, and on again around the time I am headed out for work. The schedule works perfectly. Also great is the ability to turn on/off remotely and to sync with ifttt. Ifttt really makes wemo an amazing product, as you can trigger lights with a huge range of actions. Install was fairly simple, just make sure you have a neutral wire or this won't work for you. Also be careful. I stupidly turned my power back on to test the switch after install, but did t turn it back off before pushing everything back into the wall. I got an unexpected buzz from the live wires. Do not do that. I have several smart bulbs, but vastly prefer smart switches. If your dumb switch isn't. The wrong position, your smart bulbs are worthless.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"OK so I bought this from Best Buy, but (1) reviews here have a lot ...",5.0 ,"OK so I bought this from Best Buy, but (1) reviews here have a lot of visibility and (2) amazingly the word ""Cree"" doesn't appear in ANY of the reviews... (WTF?). Bought this last week and have had it set up for about that long. Love it! The bedroom had Philips LED bulbs in the fixture (100W equivalent, soft white, bought in early 2017). When getting down to the lowest setting there was some flickering occasionally. The dimming was NOT that great, and nowhere near linear. Basically the bulbs were at 100% brightness down to 20%, and then the ""true"" dimming range was from 20% down to 0%. Last night while increasing and decreasing the brightness (from the app) one of the two bulbs started to flicker! At full brightness it was fine, but as soon as I started to bring the brightness down it started flickering (and making lovely noises). So, I decided to switch the Philips bulbs out for the Cree 100W LED bulbs from another room. WOW... what a difference! MUCH more linear dimming, and a lower cutoff as well (in other words the ""dimmest"" setting for the Cree bulbs is lower than that of the Philips bulbs, and that's better). ""True"" dimming starts at around 80% (in the app) and continues down to ~0%. Freaking love it. Should have used the Cree's in the first place. Every other room has Cree bulbs. They used to be made in the USA, and while now made in China they still have a superior warranty compared to the Philips bulbs. I have Cree's throughout the house inside AND outside (6x Cree LED floods outside). Anyway. I've only had it for a week... so granted this is a preliminary review. But I at least wanted to report that the CREE bulbs work MUCH better than Philips LEDs with this thing in case anyone else is wondering or does a keyword search of the reviews using ""Cree"" (which I did, and found nothing). Also having the light fade in and out is great also, both in the morning and at night. Enjoy!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
You will love this switch,5.0 ,I travel 4 days of the week and recently divorced my kids come over to the house all the time and never turn out the lights when they leave. (not to mention that my daughter never turns off her bedroom lights) These switches have never failed me and I can turn off the lights from where ever I am. I know have put ten of these (and one insight switch) in and I have only two complaints ok well maybe some more but in a postive way. 1. I want to buy more of these but they went from $36 dollars to $43. 2. I wish (and would expect) that they would allow zones as I have replaced all the switches in a certain room with these and it appears that you have to go thru the list in order of installed. 3. I want more options such as a ceiling fan switch (how awesome would that be) 4. The units come with a switch plate but I would like to see them offer something like a two or three spot plat as the design of the switch plate is modern and sleak looking. I have recently been playing with the IFTTT function and love it. I have 5 flood lights in my yard and I'm going to replace all the switches with this one (already ordered and on there way even at the $43 price) and I can program it quickly to turn on all of them when I hit one switch. With the IFTTT functions I have NEST thermostats and smoke alarms and I have it programed to turn on all the lights if the alarms go off. So much flexability with these. The only thing I would say is don't changed your SSID or you have to reprogram all your switches.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Awesome quality and awesome interface with Alexa!,5.0 ,"I purchased this for a home we are renting, I have an Amazon Echo and wanted to see how the home automation features worked. Well, ITS AWESOME! Hooked up the switch with no issues (I would say I have a intermediate knowledge for home wiring), once I powered the switch I was able to connect via the WeMo app with no issues, set up the switch first try and there was only 1 firmware update. As far as the function of this light switch; I love it!!!! I cannot wait to get our house so that I can install one in every room. The switch has a good ""quality"" feel to it, not cheap at all, the interface between Alexa and the switch is flawless! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to move into home automation, not needing a switch to control everything is a huge advantage (and the main reason I chose the WeMo).","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works well and works well with Amazon Echo,5.0 ,"Bought this particular brand as it works with the new Amazon Echo I received for Christmas. While I do use Dropcam for monitoring in one room (now Nest, what a disaster since Nest has bought them!), I am not interested in having one company have control over all of my cameras and devices (i.e. Nest). The switch is easy to install (please note, can be only on a single pole switch-- i.e. can only turn lights in a room by one switch, not multiple), and the App is very easy to use. It is compatible with Amazon Echo, but I typically use the timer in the App to have the lights turn on and/or off. Additionally, you can manually operate the light switch on your App. For example, I have my pendant lights over my island set to come on 5:30am so I don't walk into a dark kitchen. However, that light often activates the dogs... so I can lie in bed and shut off the island lights easily.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great smart light switch,5.0 ,"I have five WeMo light switches installed, the oldest purchased 2 1/2 years ago. To date, all of them are working great without issue. I have one installed in the garage which is subjected to temperature fluctuations but doesn't appear to be effected by that. I have two of the WeMos side by side in a 2-gang box, and found that the Leviton switch plate covers are a perfect fit for the WeMos. All of them operate on daily schedules. I like the sunrise and sunset timer options, as well as the ability to set multiple timer schedules and select specific days of the week. I love the fact that these do not require having to set up a separate web-based username and password login, which most other smart devices require. The only issue that I have encountered is with my Cisco router in which device conflicts occur where I'm unable to communicate with the smart devices via smartphone while connected to WiFi (but worked using cellular with WiFi off). The fix was to give each WiFi connected device a static IP address via the router's DHCP. After that, everything (including my other smart WiFi devices) works great. I definitely recommend this product. I still have two more to install after I finish painting.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Updated- Working now but support still weak!,4.0 ,"UPDATE Dec 2014 I bought this again and now I'm happy. Turns out, the initial installation problem was in my router settings. Took me over 1.5 hours to work with Belkin to find someone who could help me but once we fixed the setting it worked. Now, I love it. I am using IFTTT and this to have my Christmas lights come on in the morning and off at night. And the rest of the year, it's an easy way to turn off the desk lamp we always forget. I also have the motion light which works great and the light switch which is also awesome. I recommend these highly and would give 5 stars if support was even half way decent. They really need to train support people better. Original First, installation is as easy as any light switch. But networking is nearly impossible. I'm a techy and have many gadgets and know how to make things work. I tried the setup on my droid, my wifes' iphone, and my ipad. Nada. Sometimes I could connect to the wemo network and sometimes I could not. Once I got it to connect and then it wouldn't let the wemo connect to my home network. I set up a hotspot on my phone and wemo could not connect to that either. I bought 2 on sale at Amazon so I was very excited to have these. It is very disappointing to have to send these back. I really love this concept and will try again when version 2 comes out. These obviously work for some people so I don't know if there is a bad batch somewhere and I got 2 of them. One final word. I called support almost 3 weeks ago and it was 20 minutes to get someone who just took my information. They never called me back and I can't get help from them. So if you need support, this is not likely going to end well for you.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Nice Gadget,5.0 ,"I bought two of these light switches, installing one to control my front porch lights and the other to use on the light switch for my master bedroom. Installation was relatively simple. Probably the most time-consuming task was ensuring I'd flipped the right circuit breaker before removing the old light switches. The switch for the porch lights went in alongside a switch that controls the interior hall light. This switch was a bit more challenging to install, only because the back of these switches are bulky, so it was a tight squeeze to fit the switch and wires into the junction box. The actual connection of the wiring was straight forward. If you're unsure about doing it, there is an excellent video available along with the product description on Amazon. The instructions that came with the switch are pretty straight forward, too. The switch that replaced the light switch in the MBR was easy to install. Afterwards I just followed the instructions to get the switches onto my home network, waited a few minutes for the updated firmware to upload, and I was in business. I set the porch lights to come on a few minutes before sunset and go off three hours before sunrise. When we're traveling, I'll set the MBR light to come on at a random schedule. In the meantime, I can turn the overhead light on and off with my iPhone. I had to get a new switch plate for the hall/porch light switches. In this case I bought a Leviton 80405-W 2-Gang 1-Toggle 1-Decora/GFCI Device Combination Wallplate, Standard Size, from Amazon for 85 cents.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
*YOU are the on/off timer,2.0 ,"The Wemo system is buggy. Not sure if it's the device or not. The unit seems to work manually just fine. I'm running Android and the app is constantly telling me to upgrade the firmware. I do this and it causes the unit to reset and forget the timer rules that are set. In the app the rules are still applied but the light does not come on when it's supposed to. IMO, ignore the firmware update. It causes more issues than solves. Another big issue is after you have this thing working on a time schedule you'd think it would still operate on that schedule even when the WiFi drops out. Wrong. If the unit loses Wi-Fi connection it stays on or off depending on what it was last doing. If on it stays on indefinitely or off of it was off. I'm constantly opening the app to check the status and manually activating the unit or deactivating it. The set up was easy and the unit doesn't drop connection as long as your router is up and ok. The timer function through the app is the biggest issue. I've gotten used to checking on this thing and turning it on and off so it's worked out...I guess. ZWAVE has a hub and doesn't ""forget"" the timer function when disconnected from the Web. I might try those.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

works well for me,4.0 ,"I read all the reviews and decided to give this a chance. I have a house where I don't want to leave the lights on all day or on a dust to dawn timer. It's a single switch for the deck lights. The house in a remote area and dark. I can turn the lights on when I am on my way to the location. I guess if I was really lazy, I could do it from a chair, sofa or bed before letting the dog out. I can also check and make sure I turned them off after leaving. I haven't had any problems reaching the light on the local network, over 1x, 3G, LTE or a friend's home network. Installation was fairly simple and connecting to my network (router 20 ft away) was a breeze. I am using iOS apps, sorry I can't comment on android app. I haven't used any other devices, just this one switch. I plan on adding a table lamp. I haven't used the IFTTT functionality, but I might try it. I did test the rules for sunset/sunrise based on the zip code and it worked fine. A reminder, you must have a ground wire and a neutral wire for this switch to work. If you don't have these it doesn't work. Check before you buy. Four stars because Belkin should make a switch that allows two switches with one light. It's just too common in most homes these days. If they had a switch that allows that functionality, I'd buy more. Update: I purchase 2 refurbished Belkin Webcams and used the ""rules"" to turn on lights when motion is detected and to alert me to movement while ""away"". The light ""rule"" works perfectly. The pushed alerts while ""away"" is working, not perfectly, but working.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

Try... and a miss... and success in the end!,4.0 ,"Nice try... but a miss. First of all, I had to figure out the neutral wire in the box... there are some in there but they were not connected to my old single pole decora switch. I played around with the wires and a circuit tester until I figured them out and hooked it up correctly. It then connected to the internet when hanging out of the wall for a test run, and I connected it to my router, updated the firmware and I could see it on the app and turn the light on and off with it... BUT when I put it into the wall and screwed on the plastic faceplate, it no longer connected to the internet despite the router box being only 15 feet away with full signal bars according to my iphone. Now I think they need to put a warning about METAL switch boxes interfering with the signal too. Because it is a metal box. SO, I am going to return it and get a Honeywell Econoswitch instead. UPDATE: I was waiting for my new programmable Honeywell switch to arrive before replacing this switch and all of a sudden, it started to work. No clue why. I think it upgraded the firmware 3 times. Maybe that was the trick. Now I like it. Originally it was a 3 star review, now it is a 4, because it is so buggy at first and it sometimes does not connect to the app. However I am using it for the ""dusk to dawn"" feature mainly. I don't need to turn it on and off with the app 99% of the time. I really LIKE the dusk to dawn thing.

I installed it for the backyard outdoor lights on a Sunday afternoon and immediately following, ran out to purchase another for the front outside lights. Just be aware that older homes like mine have shallow metal electric boxes behind the light switches. It took a bit of maneuvering to fit all of the wire nuts back into the electric box after they were connected. Newer homes will probably not have this issue.

Looks like I have just a regular light switch now :( UPDATE: I was able to get everything working by going through the following process. 1) On your phone make sure you ""Forget This Network"" on any networks your phone might automatically connect to. 2) Turn on airplane mode 3) Turn off the circuit breaker that is supplying power to the light switch (make sure it's off for about 10 seconds then turn it back on) 4) Go to the light switch and turn only your WiFi back on on your phone 5) Wait for the light switch WiFi to show up and connect to it, my phone had to be about 3 inches from the light switch This took about 3 hours to figure out since none of the instructions on the Belkin site worked for me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Love this! Need more!,5.0 ,"I just installed this switch. Physical installation was about like any light switch. The part that goes inside the box was a lot wider than the old switch and I had to chip some plaster away where it was overhanging the box opening. No problem. The part that fits into the switch box is not very deep and allows for plenty of clearance for wires and connections. I Installed the software on my iphone and followed the instructions. I gave it the wifi password and that's about all it took. Hooking it to the Nest thermostat was as easy as knowing the Nest account login information. I ordered this to solve a problem with a switch in an inconvenient location for a device I forget to turn off sometimes. Now that I've seen it work, I can think of several other places where I'd like to install one.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I LOVE THESE SWITCHES!,5.0 ,"These switches are incredibly awesome! Works with my Echo Dot (Alexa) and iPhone. One note: The switch requires a white neutral wire that provides the power to the switch. In my case, I only had the two wires coming down from the light. To correct this, I had to run a single white wire from a near-by plug in outlet up to the switch. You can either be ambitious and run it through the wall, or in my case, since I'm renting, I ran it out of the outlet plate then along the baseboard up to the switch much like you would run a speaker wire. All in all, I love the switch. I have 3 light switches, and 4 outlet switches so I now control everything in my house with my voice.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Love it. Just a little glitchy on install.,4.0 ,"This is a five star tool, but it wasn't that easy to install. I had the WEMO app on my phone from using the Wemo Crockpot. I spent a lot of time trying to get it connect. It turned out that I needed to remove the app from my phone and reinstall it and then it kicked in instantly. Now, I use it all the time and LOVE it. I use it with my Amazon ECHO and it works perfectly. Love the device, just needed the glitch posted somewhere to save the hours I spent trying to connect.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Mobile app for controlling lights is great. Integration with Amazon Echo is awesome,4.0 ,"I have put 4 of these in the house. Not too hard to install if you have ever installed a regular wall switch. Setup and installation from the iPhone was a breeze. Pros: Mobile app for controlling lights is great. Integration with Amazon Echo is awesome. Kids love to tell Alexa to turn the lights on and off. Scheduling to have lights turn on and off while home or away is great. Cons: - Sometimes lights get ""confused"" and lose wifi connectivity. I have had to hard reboot each switch at least once. If you are using this to control a second home or rental property this means you have to physically be onsite to fix. - Lights are tied to local wifi, so you are chewing up additional IP addresses. Depending on the number of devices, you may need to upgrade your home wifi infrastructure. - 3 Pole installation is possible but really inconvenient. - No dimming capabilities","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great light switches to automate my life.,5.0 ,"Installed and set up the light switches in minutes. Took a couple attempts to connect but it wasn't too difficult after turning my phone into airplane mode when launching the app. I set up the schedule to turn on at dusk and turn off as dawn. It figures out the time based on my location. Now I have to see if they last for years. I'm hoping they do. Now I don't have to turn on and off my outside lights. I can automate the routine, useless tasks in my life.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great wifi light control! Works great!,5.0 ,Works perfectly! Bought a second one as the first was awesome! Easy set up for anyone with a little tech knowledge. Connects to wifi easily and stays connected. Updated firmware easily and provides online usage instructions.

Making my life easier,5.0 ,"I have several Wemo plugs around my house, but this was my 1st time purchasing the Mini smart plug. I love the fact that it only takes up space 1 of the sockets. This year I purchased two mini’s, one for my Christmas tree and one for my staircase Christmas lights. I then connected them to Alexa. No more going upstairs to plug/ unplug the lights. My old timers were ok, but these are so much better. I love being able to say “Alexa, turn on the Christmas tree.” “Alexa turn off the staircase lights.” Also, I can turn on the lights using my smart phone if I am away. Great product. I would recommend.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Alexa + Wemo = Amazoning!,5.0 ,"Installation was straight forward and included wire nuts for installation. I wish there was push in connections instead of wire nuts though was not that big of a deal to use the wire nuts. I was also able to setup each of the 2 switches I purchased within 5 minutes of installation and connecting to my Amazon Alexa and Dots was super simple. I just asked Alexa to find new devices and she found both within 20 seconds and from that point forward I could just say ""Alexa turn in living room or Alexa turn on Family room"" and the corresponding room lights turned on!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED - POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT,3.0 ,"I had purchased two plugs and setting up the app and connecting them were easy. So I decided to purchase the light switch. I have worked two hours trying to connect it to the APP and I have reached maximum frustration level. So I went to the APP section for Questions about a WeMo product. It indicates you can get in touch via phone for support questions. I called the number shown in the APP for support and there is a message that the telephone number is not in service and to contact the Support Team. I went to the Belkin Home Page to make sure I had the correct number and the same phone number in the APP is on the website. Again I called and got the same message. I will try Facebook in a day or two once I have had time to bring down my blood pressure. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED !!!! UPDATE 09/8/17 - Returned the original purchase and requested a replacement. Just finsshed installing the replacement and the process worked just like it should. Extremely pleased with the return and replacement process. However, I am still disappointed with Belkin and the WeMo app as there is information for telephone support that did not exist. Recommend that Belkin look at updating the app to make sure the information for Support is correct. I updated from a 1 Star to a 3 Star. Too bad the outdated Service information in the app prevent a 5 Star rating.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Switch is too big for 2-gang switchbox and wireless roaming doesn't quite work,3.0 ,"I bought the WeMo Light Switch to automate the lighting of the front entrance of my house. Installing the switch was not rocket science, but it took some efforts and it took me about 20 minutes. Controlling the switch using the app is simple, and setting up rule to automate the turn on/off of the switch is great. That said, I ran into two issues in the process: 1. The switch itself is big. Yes, it would fit into the switch box. I installed this switch in an existing two-gang switch box: one WeMo Light Switch, and one regular light switch. However, I could NOT get my existing wall plate to install properly because the WeMo Light Switch elevates the wall plate more than the regular light switch does. I eventually bought another WeMo Light Switch in the hope that my existing wall plate would fit better ... it did, but it created a big gap between the wall plate and the wall as the result. I wish Belkin has a two-gang wall plate for the WeMo Light Switch, but it doesn't, and the big gap between the wall plate and the wall really bugs me. 2. The WeMo Light Switch only connects to the 2.4GHz WiFi network. This is not a problem in general, but in my case, the switch is far from my main router at the back of my house, and connection was not reliable. I have a wireless repeater at home to address the dead zone issue, but this setup uncovers a problem, i.e. the WeMo Light Switch sometimes connects to the wireless repeater (which provides good connection), and sometimes connects directly to the main router (which has poor connection). Depends on how the switch is connected wirelessly at a given time, I could either detect and control the switch prefectly, or the switch was not detected at all. I understand this issue has to do with the handling of wireless roaming in the switch that I have no control of. To fix this, either Belkin needs to have better software to handle the wireless roaming issue, or I need to install another wireless repeater to workaround the issue. This is the deal breaker for me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Decent product but hampered by the software application,4.0 ,"Overall the product is decent and delivers functionality based on the design. In general I consider myself rather savvy with regards to general computer knowledge and network configuration. I have my own custom network configuration at home with distinct wireless networks on various bands including separated guest network, etc. My current job is in the IT industry providing end user support. I only mention all of that for background purposes and whatever it is worth for credibility sake. Overall I would say the physical plug is good quality and fairly straightforward in terms of basic functions. Where the issues lie are really within the internal firmware and the associated software application. The initial setup is where I experienced issues, as other reviewers have noted. Establishing a connection from the plug to the wireless network seemed to be the most problematic. It would occasionally fail to recognize any network in my home, I tried multiple both hidden and visible. Typically the software would indicate incorrect credentials and refused to establish a connection. I even returned the plug in exchange for another unit. That behaved in the same manner. I eventually was able to establish a connection through the software application but only after trying for an extended period. Unfortunately I cannot definitively say what steps were successful since I tried so many different paths. One thing I would mention is you may have to try repeatedly in the app, despite how frustrating. I would also allow the app time to connect, it seems even if it indicates failure to connect, there were times it actually established a connection from the plug to the wireless network but gave a false feedback. Indicating it had failed to connect. In my opinion the software app needs some improvement and is not as robust as is needed for this type of product. The plug itself has worked fine ever since the setup was successfully completed. I have been able to use the app to control the plug, as well as integrate with Amazon Alexa for voice control.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
So convenient I'll bet you a caveman would have wanted one!,5.0 ,"I'm 57 years old, I am far from Tech savey. Our computer class in High School consisted of IBM Punch cards. I was a little hesitant to go to these Smart Plugs and Switches, after all I was finally starting to understand (I think anyway) how my smart phone works and my Amazon Echo. So on Amazon days I bought 2 Wemo Mini Smart Plugs. After they were delived to my house they sat on my coffee table for a week because I was affaird to open and activate the plug. Finally I opened the plug read the very easy and clear instruction and had my Wemo Mini Smart plug operational in less then 5 minutes operating my bedroom light with both my smart phone and my Amazon Echo. Pretty Cool!!! Then I laughed at myself, and ordered 3 more. They will not sit waiting to be activated when they arrive. If you can find the Setting button on your smart phone the rest of the set-up is easy.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The instructions are good. Even if you don't read and just look ...,5.0 ,"So far no issues. I bought 8 of these and they all work without issue. I had to figure out what a neutral wire was and how to hook it up to get it to work properly. Without the neutral wire they appear to work, but you can't get the wifi to connect. The instructions are good. Even if you don't read and just look at the pictures you will see how to hook it up and add the neutral wire to the switch. I have Amazon Echo controlling them and I am the envy of the neighborhood with how cool and fluid these devices work with Alexa (Amazon's Echo). Needless to say I recommend these devices. Just make sure you have a neutral wire, because it is required. Most homes before 2011 don't have a neutral wire at the switch. In most cases, unless you have an advanced switch already installed, the neutral wire won't already be used by the switch.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
First step in home automation...,5.0 ,"This is my first foray into home automation...I guess. I installed it in about 10 minutes. The video on the Amazon site is perfect. The pairing process worked perfectly and the switch switched the first time I tapped the virtual button. I have set it up to turn on the outside lights on either side of my garage everyday at sundown and turning them off again at sunrise. The lights can also be turned on from the actual switch by tapping the black dot in the picture (which is really a green LED). And, of course, they can be turned on manually from my iPhone. I don't expect this item to do more than that, so it's perfect for my application.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Nice gadget to control outside lights,5.0 ,"I was looking for this type of light switch, simply because when going out early in the day and coming back home when it is dark, turning the lights on during the time when going out would be a waste of energy, so this switch allowed me to turn the lights on when I am away after it gets dark. The setup is very easy, although Belkin sent a firmware update that broke some of the functionality a month after I purchased it, but their customer support was very helpful and responsive, so after another month they issued another firmware update that fixed the issue. I love this light switch and I plan to purchase a second one. It is a bit high in price therefore one can connect it to important lights only. Update May 7, 2015: I just bought my third Wemo switch. The firmware is stable now and it is as easy to setup as it was the first time. This switch makes it very easy to control lights remotely, in many occasions I am away from home early in the day so turning the light on early is just a waste of money, with the Wemo switch one can turn the lights on when it gets dark before coming home.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
This is a terrific product,5.0 ,"I purchased one of these switches to work with my home automation system, which employs a raspberry pi and software from MySensors and Home-assistant. Home-assistant has a built-in configuration for Wemo devices. The switch worked perfectly right away and presented no difficulty in set-up. Given the success with the first switch, I purchased two more. One of the very useful features of this switch is that you can operate it outside your home network. This allows you to observe and change the state of the switch from any location. I use this feature to help overcome a system crash when I am away for some duration. I simply turn on and off the switch using my iPhone to reboot my unresponsive raspberry.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I have three. I want more.,5.0 ,"We now have three of these in the house and two of the outlet controls. We mainly use them for automating lights to turn on and off at specific times - outside lights come on at dusk, inside lights are scheduled to turn on and off when we are away. I've had a few other types, but have overall been most happy with the WeMo devices. They are easy to install, easy to turn up, and easy enough for anyone in the family to operate. We plan to get more. The only problem I ever had was when one was struck by lightning and died, but that would have happened with any light switch, I imagine.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
CAUTION: WEMO does not work over a 4G or LTE network.,4.0 ,"I installed two of these in a three gang switch. The switch is not too deep so there is still plenty of room for the wire nuts and wires to fit inside the electrical box. Once installed, set-up and configuration was easy. Took less than 5 minutes. It may have been my misread, but one thing that I wanted to do was have the ability to turn the lights off remotely. What i mean by that was if I was out of the house past dark, and wanted to turn my outside lights on for when I come home, I wanted to be able to do this over a 4G or LTE network. CAUTION: WEMO does not work over a 4G or LTE network. You must be on a Wi-fi network for the WEMO to work. These have only been installed for a day, and I seem to loose one on the WEMO app. I will investigate further and re-post if it is a problem with the device or just with me as the user. Update: Belkin saw this post and sent me an email how to get it to work when not on the local wifi network. The remote enabling wasn't the problem. For some reason one of the light switches simply disappears from the network every once in a while. I did a hard reset to see if it becomes more stable. We will see.....","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Very good Wi-Fi switch,5.0 ,"I had this switch for four months. It was very easy to install as it fits perfectly the footprint of a standard switch. Very easy also to connect to it once the phone app is installed. It took 5 minutes longer than I expected to configure the on-off times from the app, but it was just matter of understanding the logic behind the ""events"". They are just what the name implies: triggers. They do not care about the history of the system (i.e. was the switch on or off?) and simply do what is specified. I am quite happy with the product. Never lost connection or needed any attention. I like the fact that if the trigger is ""turn on at sunset"", the turn on time is adjusted for the actual sunset time for the season and does not require adjustments throughout the seasons.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Second plug as good as the first,5.0 ,"This is the second Wemo plug I've gotten from Amazon and I'm just as pleased as I was with the first. The system found the plug (after a couple tries) and integrated well. I was able to lump the plugs together under a ""list"" so that I can either turn the lamps on individually based on what I named them, or use the list name and have both lamps turn on or off. It works perfectly with Alexa and is a lot of fun to boot. If you're looking to dip your toe into the smart home pool but don't want to commit to a hub and the cost of full systems, try this simple plug first.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wonderful devices!,5.0 ,"I originally bought 2 of these Wemo Mini smart plugs and liked them so much I bought 2 more. I use them with the Wemo mobile app and several Alexa devices throughout the house. Everything works as it is designed. The app allowed me to program the plugs so that I was able to eliminate all the lamp timers in the house. I can even control the plugs directly from the mobile app. I chose the Wemo Mini because of the size. They cover only one receptacle on the wall outlet or power strip, leaving all other receptacles open. Great little devices. I plan to get some Wemo integrated light switches in the future.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Love automated lighting,4.0 ,"I like the new form factor of the upgraded version of the wemo plug. Works just like the other style but the bulk is spread out so two can be stacked on top of each other. I bought two and they have worked fantastic with alexa and the wemo app. As many others have written, setting these devices up is miserable. It took multiple refreshes and opening and closing of the app to get them to work properly the first time. Not much has changed since the old style style plug unfortunately. I found that I was most successful if I put my phone right by the plug to set it up so it would receive the best possible signal and not be confused by the wifi signal from my router. Fantastic product once you get through the pain of the setup process.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I got this as a gift and I love it. It works great with your Alexa and ...,5.0 ,I got this as a gift and I love it. It works great with your Alexa and IFTTT. Love that you can tell Alexa to turn it on and off as well as dim it to a specific percentage. Love the long press functionality and night mode. Wish there were more smart push modes to let you do different things but the long press is nice to have. Install and setup was really easy so I had it up and running in no time. Only thing that is a little wonky is selecting the dim setting on the switch. you sort of slide your finger up and down the little bar which works fine but feels a little awkward.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Expensive - but makes life simpler,4.0 ,"Item arrived quickly and is working just as stated. Only drawback on this is, that if you connect it to Alexa for your TV, VCR,DVD or any other electronic with a standby mode, Alexa can't really turn the appliance on. It will only turn the power on or off that goes to the specific item that is plugged into the switch. From there you will still have to use the remote to turn it all the way on :-(. For appliances that just come on and off, like plug in lights, plug in fans, radios, space heaters etc. it does work great. The plug in has a little wireless button on the top that you can push and turn the appliance on manually as well.

Great for remote and timed lighting.,5.0 ,This is a great product. Take your time to set up your Belkin Light Switches or plug in modules. The first time they only worked when I was logged into my own wifi. Could not operate remotely at first. For some crazy reason my wife's iPhone worked remotely but not mine. I reset all and required and reconfigured. I got everything right and love I. I can now turn on remotely all devices that have a Belkin Device connected. I can turn on the Outside lights remotely. I have a finished basement with overhead lighting. One side is a TV Room and the other is a computer room. The computer room side light switch is at the too if the stairs and until now could not be controlled without climbing the stairs. I have 3 of these in wall Belkin Light Switches and 3 of the plugin Belkins. All controlling lighting both hard wired and plug in lamps. NOTE: IMPORTANT.... For these in the wall light switches to work you MUST HAVE A NEUTRAL WIRE in the junction box. If you are unsure look behind your current light switch if you see a separate pair or wires that have a wire nut on them they are the neutral wire. They do not connect to your old switch but are as I said held together with a wire nut. The Belkin light switch has a neutral wire that requires you to connect it to the neutral wire found in your switches junction box. I highly recommend this device for anyone looking for remote or timed operation.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Trouble Shooting Tips - read before buying, and definately before installing",4.0 ,"The Belkin Switch is pretty good, and it'll get the job done, but I did have some trouble with the installation, and used various reviews to help me getting it to work properly, so I thought I would share so others might have an easier time. First of all my install was a little bit more complicated than most because I was replacing 5 switches in the same box, i'm not an electrician, and I have an old house with old wiring. One very important thing to understand is that you really need to have a neutral wire! Wemo switch wont work without it. Neutral wires are typically white, however if you live in an old house there is no telling what improvised short cuts people have taken over the years since it went up, or how things have changed in terms of wiring standards. Another clue that a wire is neutral is that all the neutral wires, coming from different ports in the box are joined together by a single wire nut. if you wire the whole thing as per the instructions and the switch is not working or acting funny (clicking sounds, and light flashes every few seconds, etc.) You may have an issue with the neutral wires. Two things I learned from this install - 1. You can buy a very cheap voltmeter for less than $3 and use it to make sure none of the white wires that are bound together are ""hot"" (have current) or ""not neutral"". You will need to have the breaker switch on for this testing. If you touch one end of the voltmeter to the exposed part of a wire, and the other to ground (the metal box/casing), hot wires will cause the voltmeter to light up, neutral wires will not. In my case one of my white wires was actually a ""hot"" wire and was disrupting the neutral wires in the wire nut, and causing my wemo to not work. 2. Make sure you have a large enough Wire nut to handle the number of neutral wire you are trying to tie together. In my case just one more wire was too much. I tried using it anyways, and the wemo switch didn't work, because the neutrals wires were not bound together properly. Finally I decided to purchase a huge wire nut that would fit the 6 large gauge neutral wires, and guess what . . . it worked! Next . . . once your wemo switch is ""working"" or properly installed at least, it'll try to download a firmware update. Go ahead and let it do it's thing, but realize that this may not proceed in the ""as advertised"" straight forward manner. My experience was that the update proceeded, then it gave me a message saying ""hooray update complete"" on my phone about 15 minutes later. Then it tried to update again, but this time it never ended. I even left it ""updating"" overnight, because another reviewer had mentioned that his took all night. The following morning it was still not working, but at least it wasn't clicking and flashing my lights. I read on some post somewhere that if you have this never ending update, you can turn off the breakers and turn them back on, and somehow it will fix it. I was near the end of my rope at this point, and thinking of throwing it in the trash, but the trick worked. Turning the breaker off and on fixed the issue. I worried that if the breaker had to be turned off again, or if the lights went out it would somehow stop working again, but I have since had to shut the breaker off to work on other non wemo switches, and it hasn't caused any problems. My WeMo light switch has been working as advertised without any problems since the install, and i'm happy with the product. I have an old crappy, 10yr old router that I bought refurbished for $20 and I have about 30 ft and a brick wall between the router and the switch and it works without a hitch now. I primarily use it to turn my porch lights on at sunset and off at sunrise, and sometimes I turn it off earlier using my phone before going to sleep. In Summary, make sure you have a neutral wire, make sure all the bundled neutral wires are actually neutral, and there aren't any hot wires, use an adequate size wire nut for the neutral wires, and if your firmware update takes more than 24hrs turn the breaker off for a minute and then on again. I feel like many of the negative reviews may stem from giving up early, or not being able to successfully troubleshoot small issues that come up. Almost all electrical work requires some troubleshooting and even patience (especially if you don't know what you're doing, haha) Additional notes - during my install process I never used the reset button on the device. I would give the device 5 stars if not for the never ending update issue. Good luck.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Viola! It works.,4.0 ,"I am currently running 12 WeMo switches and 2 outlets. All of them are either controlled remotely or using Alexa. The devices themselves are easy to setup once you have the smart phone app. Setting up your first switch takes the longest as you are pawing your way through the app. However, once you get the hang of it, installing a device takes a few minutes and that is all. So far I am pleased with the products. I have taken advantage of the timers, long press and combining devices together. Sort of like having a dynamic electrician allowing you to change how switches interface with the homeowner. There have been some quirks with devices failing to respond (later they fix themselves) or when I upgraded my router, these things went into manual mode for a few hours. I tried emailing support but heard nothing. Later, each device was back online. The WiFi name never changed, only the IP changed, go fugue. So if that is the only negative I have with WeMo, it’s trivial. As I write this, all devices are up and running.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Crashes at least once a month!!! (However it is my router that is causing it.),4.0 ,"I had it for a little over a month. I already had to turn off my breaker to reset this switch. Not sure why that happened. It's like the switch crashed and it needed to be re-booted. Since then it worked fine. However, when a switch doesn't work, even if it is reliable 99% of the time, it's frustrating. 4/2/2017 - I confirmed it's my router that is the problem. I know this because everytime this WeMo light switch stops working, my wi-fi camera also stops working. Then to get it to work again, I have to reset the router. This really proves it's the router and not the WeMo. I really should give this a 5 star, but the reason I'm not is because when my router crashes, the light switch cannot be manually turned on. They should of at least made it where the light switch can work manually without wifi.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Banishing Bats back to the darkness!,5.0 ,"Love it! Our main use of the dimmer is a little unusual. We have a covered back deck that bats like to roost under in the summertime. While they roost they make quite a mess. We've tried a lot of deterrents and none have worked. So I started experimenting with the lights. Turning on the lights just a little bit at night prevents them from roosting. Now I can program the LED floods to come on very slowly at sunset to about 7% and this prevents the bat roosting, and turn off close to sunrise. As well, it is nice to enjoy the area out there and be able to adjust lighting without leaving my seat. Thanks to Wemo for making the dimmer!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

Great programming options in app. Get one, and you'll start learning the places that will benefit from having a WiFi switch. No, not all items need one. We use in conjunction with security cameras (they don't really see well in the dark when you are on a trip), accent lighting, Christmas tree lights (when done with that season, use it for another light), porch lights (random on and off schedule times), attic fan (remote on or scheduled on), night lights (using actual lights with low wattage led bulbs), etc.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
2.4 GHz only; Alexa couldn't find it twice,4.0 ,"I have two of these. They only run on 2.4 GHz wifi, something I'd like to abandon at some point. They get a lot of use daily, and only twice in the last month was Alexa unable to locate one of the devices. So it is not a major issue, but it has happened twice. Still highly recommend these for automating lamps or similar devices. I am just about out of plugged in lamps to automate and need to move on to wall switches. Update: Still very happy with these. I have two lamps and a tabletop air filter on it. They perform wonderfully, and I'm still very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

Far better than the comparable TP-Link,5.0 ,"I have bought and installed both the WeMo, link below, and the comparable TP-link so I have experience with both. There is no comparison. The WeMo is better quality. I installed the TpLink first via a professional electrician and it flat out did not work. The light would turn off in a few seconds and I could not get the wifi enable app to connect. After four rounds with TP's technical support (who were incompetent and worse you can not understand them) I gave up and returned it in favor of the WeMo. I installed the WeMo it worked perfectly and the app connection to the network was seamless.

Hand-off functionality...,5.0 ,"I own 2 WEMO devices one to control my porch light one for my stair lights. It's a no-brainer. I absolutely love the look, functionality and efficiency of these devices. Setting Rules. Establishing automatic rules to manage on and off functionality for each device is simple and easy. The app is extremely user-friendly and has times already established for your zone, or if you prefer you can customize specific times down to every 15 minutes. Syncing with Amazon Echo (Alexa) I love this feature - I mean it's so easy. I just installed my WeMo switches (plus wall scuffs-lol) then asked Alexa to locate devices. And, about 20 secs later - BAM!! #Done. Now when I'm traveling I can control my smart home via one app... Or if there are problems with one app versus the other - I can switch.

"Four Lights, Three Wemos, Two Commands, One Alexa, and a cat named Snickers",5.0 ,"I have bought three of these so far and definitely plan on purchasing a couple more, all are working well and as expected. I purchased one a couple months ago, loved it, and so I bought two more just this past week. I have the three of them set up to turn on/off four lights twice a day (three hours in the morning and 5+ hours in the evening) and also have them hooked up to Alexa with two commands. They are fairly easy to setup initially via the app and also simple to pair with Alexa, just follow the instructions and you're golden. I'm not going to lie though, I did encounter a couple minor, super small hiccups during the setup but nothing that I couldn't figure out or would cause me to rate this any lower than a 5 star (maybe a 4.5 but since half stars aren't allowed we will round up). First tiny hiccup: the first wemo I purchased took a few tries in getting the app to recognize it but with some persistence, a dash of patience, and a couple of restarts of the wemo, wemo app, and iPad and it was good to go in less than 15 minutes and it hasn't given me any trouble since (the two other wemos I purchased a week or so after and together they took less than 5 minutes to setup). Second and last little hiccup (solved in less than 10 mins but still something for users to be aware of): getting Alexa to turn my two newest wemos on at the same time by saying one command, I thought I could be clever and name both wemos with the same name and Alexa would know to turn both on/off when I said their name, however, it turns out that you have to instead create a ""group"" within Alexa's app containing the wemos you want to turn on/off together and the caveat is they cannot have the same name within the wemo app. If anyone figured out how to side step this (besides creating a group or asking Alexa more than one command) let me know, but naming two wemos the same name just did not work for me (or Alexa). Use one wemo for two lights! - My third wemo works double and controls our two small lights on either side of our tv, just plug a multi-socket plugin into the wemo plug and wah-la, a one plug wemo became a two plug wemo. :) Lastly, and most importantly, our cat Snickers is a HUGE FAN of these wemos and appreciates them very much because it makes her feel like we are home if we get home late or go away for the weekend. And yes, Snickers told me this herself, she also said that her and Alexa get along great and that they talk at least a few times a day. I have not witnessed any of their interaction because she says they only chat when we aren't home, and trust me I've tried asking Alexa if she talk with Snickers and she just outright denies knowing who Snickers is altogether. I have also tried looking into Alexa's app for the conversations but to no avail, I suspect either Snickers is going onto my iPad and deleting their convos or Alexa is not recording them. I contemplated getting a security camera but as much as I want proof of their friendship I would just never forgive myself if I ruined it. In any case, these are great and I definitely recommend purchasing more than one, at least enough to control all the lamps you turn on daily or even periodically because the wemo app also lets you set which days you want it to turn on/off.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The devices are work just fine and deserve five stars,3.0 ,"This is our seventh Wemo device. We use them, together with IFTTT.com, to automate lights and heaters in two locations. We use switches, wall light switches, and finally this mini switch, which fits neatly inside our landscaping lights low-voltage transformer box and controls our outdoor lighting. Another set of wemos controls heating in our vacation location, and together with an inexpensive ThermoPeanut and a couple of IFTTT rules, can function as an internet-based whole house thermostat. The devices are work just fine and deserve five stars. I'm taking one star off for the fact that the app will only work in one location. We use automation precisely because we need to control a remote location. Having to install the Wemo app on multiple devices, and control each location on a different device, is a serious hurdle (we also had to create two accounts on IFTTT to deal with this.) And taking a second start off for the app in general. IFTTT has proven more reliable than the app in setting up and executing rules (although only the app allows you to specify ""15 minutes before / after sunset"". Nothing in IFTTT allows provides that at the moment.) And if there is a networking problem and your devices, for any reason, lose contact, you cannot fix it remotely and must go back on location to fix the issue. Fix the multiple-location / multiple networks issue and I will add the two starts!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Like living on a Star Trek spaceship,5.0 ,"I owned the previous version and picked up two more on Amazon when I saw they had improved the form factor design. While I bought them for the better design, they seem to perform a little better too. These work in some weak wi-fi spots that the old model did not. That's exciting because now I can reliably dedicate one Wemo Mini to the area where we plug in our Christmas tree and can simply tell Alexa to ""turn Christmas on."" Lights, train, music all come on. The old model still works and will now take over the role of timing when our basement dehumidifier runs so that we only use electricity for it during off-peak hours.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I like the wemo system so far,4.0 ,I like the wemo system so far. Setup is easy although it did take a few tries to get the ios app to see my device after pointing it to the wifi. I just ordered an outlet style device for a lamp in the livingroom so i can have the light cone on with a time instead of leaving a light on all day. The only issue with the switch is the body is a tight fit in my older 1960's style metal gangboxes. I was able to fit one wemo switch in there with a standard next to it by squeezing all the wiring behind the standard switch. Two wemo switches would definately not fit in there due to their depth and the needed space for the wire nuts.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The instructions leave a bit to be desired and web site support is useless. The mobile phone application needs improvement in th,5.0 ,"The Belkin WeMo Light Switch works perfectly. The instructions leave a bit to be desired and web site support is useless. The mobile phone application needs improvement in that I would like on/off times to vary slightly around the set times. My twenty-year-old wall timer does this. One caution: when you connect the two black wires from the switch, one specific black wire has to be connected to the hot side black wire coming out of the electrical box and the other to the load side black wire coming out of the electrical box . It doesn't seem to matter with regular wall switches, but Belkin is clear about that (see the pictures on the switch side of the black wires. I called a friend to tell me how to figure this out. The power has to be on to determine the hot side and the load side. Ask someone who knows about electricity or search the internet. For those who didn't know that the switch needs a neutral wire or that the switch does not work as a replacement for a three-way switch, you should have visited the Belkin web site. Both conditions are dealt with clearly.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
she responds by saying the smart plug is not responding,3.0 ,"Works intermittently. I have it set to automatically turn on a light while I'm away, and several times I've come home to find that the light was off. Then, it would randomly turn on then turn off again every 30 to 45 minutes or so. I've found that even when the timed function is not in use, it works only part of the time as well. This item is connected to my Amazon Echo. Sometimes when I tell Alexa to turn the light on or off, she responds by saying the smart plug is not responding. It's great when it works, but it is not worth the money for only working sometimes.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Awesome with an Echo!,5.0 ,"Wow, I bout two plugs and a switch and now control lights and a fan via the wemo. Super easy to set up and most any movies could do it. Pros: easy set up!

Communication with phone via LTE / GSM only - Problem that other WeMo devices don't have.,2.0 ,"I've had success with other WeMo Modules, but the light switches seem to be particularly communication hindered. Maybe it's that they're in a wall box with high voltage wires all around them. I don't know. We have two WeMo wall switches. We've been able to successfully turn on the switch's WiFi, attached with the WeMo app, and define the switch. In about 50% of our attempts, we're able to get the switch to find the house WiFi and attach, in other cases we can never get it to attach to the house WiFi (even though the router is only 30 feet across the room). And even when it does successfully attach, it will often ""Forget"" and need to be reset and re-defined. And finally, in all cases, the only way to communicate with the switch after it is set up is to turn the phone's WiFi off and use only its LTE / GSM data connection. If you try to communicate with the switch over the same WiFi network that the switch is attached to, the WeMo app can't find the switch. We don't have this communication problem with our WeMo Insight switch, and the fact that we can communicate with the light switch via the phone's LTE / GSM connection tells me that the WeMo switch is still able to communicate with the WiFi hub in the house. But there's something wonky about the software that makes it impossible to talk to the switch from the same WiFi network, and something that makes it difficult for it to even find and attach itself when setting it up. Still more work to do to make this a reliable product.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Really great, useful item!",4.0 ,"I purchased this product to replace my old outside motion activated lights. The idea of being able to program usage is very appealing. I have it set up through IFTTT to come on when my daughter enters the neighborhood at night coming home from work. The Wemo app turns it off after a set amount of time. Pretty slick. Installation was fairly straightforward, but you will need to have a neutral wire in your switch box. This device has a light and a radio so needs the neutral to function. After installation it's a simple matter of installing the Wemo app and using your phone to connect it to your home wifi. After that it does a firmware update that takes a few minutes and you're good to go. I have had no problems with the software and did not contact tech support. I do own a couple of other Wemo products and I can tell you that recent firmware updates have made them much better. It has a small green light at the very bottom that is on when the switch is off. A blue power light illuminates when the switch is on.. It can be switched on or off from the app, the wall switch or by voice if you use Alexa. All in all I really like it and so does my daughter when she arrives home after dark. I rate it 4 stars because I wish it had dimming capability and were compatible with my Logitech Harmony remote.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
LOVE My WEMO Plugs!,5.0 ,Great device to turn on lamps before you arrive home at night. No more stumbling around in the dark fumbling for the light switch. Set automatically or turn on manually - super convenient. Picture this: Leave home during daylight so lamps are off. Arriving home after the sun goes down and the house is now dark. Outside lights / porch lights are on but those don't light up the inside of the house. With the Demo plugs you can turn on any light in the house BEFORE you arrive and walk into a well-lit home. Typical scenario: You are away from home much longer than you anticipated and now it's dark. You can now turn on any light connected to a WEMO switch from wherever you are. Piece of mind restored!

Loving the Wemo Mini Smart Plug!,5.0 ,"I bought one to control a lamp. It was easy to set up and control with the Wemo app and easy to set up to be controlled by Alexa, which is how I mainly use it. Later I bought a hub and three bulbs by Sengled. They worked fine until my power went off. After that the hub would only talk to one of the three bulbs.

"Good hardware, software could use some work",3.0 ,"This product shipped very quickly and it was appropriately packaged. I have no complaints about the device itself.

When I initially downloaded and installed the application it restarted itself a handful of times until I got my device/network all synced. Once everything was up and running I had no further issues with the application. This device looks like a great first step toward a smart home.

You must manually place the Nest into Eco/Away mode, and return manually. I believe Nest and WeMo mislead this fact in their advertising, and it is unfortunate.

Great Device for Controlling Outdoor lights,5.0 ,"We are in the process of adding a pool and pool house and I was looking for something to control the lights on the pool house and to control the outdoor lights on the garage and the flood lights on the house. I decided to give these a try. At first, I was going to have an electrician install the lights, but then I decided to try to install them myself. It was pretty easy. I have now installed 5 at different locations in the house (1 at the front door, 1 at the back door, 1 in the garage and 2 by the door leading to the garage). This allows me to control the lights outside the garage and flood lights on the garage side of the house (3 switches), 1 light outside the front entry (1 switch) and the flood lights on the street side of the house (1 switch). The app had some connection issues, but once I set up the IFTTT link it has been pretty stable. Each new light will want to update firmware first thing and that can take some time. I have enjoyed setting in the house playing with the lights. I just imagine my neighbors talking about whether they should tell us that we have a short in our outdoor lights that keep going on and off. Then I set up a timer on the app and the outdoor lights come on at sundown and go of at 10 p.m. Also, I downloaded the IFTTT app and set up several ""recipes"" as well. I set two up that allow me to text #on to a number and all the outdoor lights come on and a text of #off turns them all off. In addition, I set up another recipe on my cell phone that turns on all the outdoor lights when I am within a couple of miles of the house. You can turn recipes on and off so I do not have to worry about the lights coming on unless I turn that recipe on (like if I am traveling late at night). This seems a little redundant because you can just turn the lights on and off from your cell phone, but it is easier to text #on than having to turn on each light individually. I have had the lights running for almost a week. If you have multiple access points in your house do not remember the wifi settings because it may need to connect with a different access point that is closer to the switch. Have enjoyed a lot and will definitely add to the pool house too.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

My house is not dumb any more :-),5.0 ,I've been using it for a week I feel my house is not dumb any more. I had my front entrance being too dark and I kept forgetting to turn it on at night. And when I did remember to turn it on I would be on for week(s) sometimes having to change the bulbs because I left it on for days eve weeks. Now I just configured that one of the outer lights turn on at sunset and off at 00:30 And the other outer light will turn on at sunset and off at sunrise. This works marvelous and solved my problem. Now te new update allows you to set an off timer. So if during the day someone turns the light off and forget to turn it off it can be auto off after 5-10-30-60 Or so times. Also if I'm out of town I can use the app to turn the lights on and off so someone thinks there is people inside.

Nice idea with plenty of room for firmware and app improvements,3.0 ,"Update: I so wanted this switch to work that I took a chunk of my afternoon and fully uninstalled the app from my iPhone, reset the Wemo itself by holding in the reset button as I plugged it in, reinstalled the app from the appstore, and then went through the full setup process again. The first time I tried this it failed so I then went back and tried a new approach whereby I made sure my iPhone was using the same SSID that the device would be using (I have several SSID's established in my home and the iPhone and Wemo were using 2 different SSID's on the same local network). I have my device back up and running again and I am happy. I am hopeful that this device will become more robust over time with firmware and app updates. The feature I really crave now before I purchase more is a function whereby I can set a default countdown timer that will be activated as I turn the device on via the hard switch or software switch. In this way I can easily have the desired lights turn off after a given about of time I desire. Original 1 star review follows: I purchased this to control lights around the house. It was easy to setup using the iPhone app and procedures offered within the app. At one point my power went out and I tried to access the device while the power was out and after that the software could never see the switch reliably again until I fully uninstalled and reinstalled the app plus reset the device. After that, the device worked again for a while until one day an app update came out and from then on the device activation button was always unavailable in the app even after a full reinstall of app and reset of the device. I guess I'll just wait and hope a firmware update comes out again someday and perhaps that will restore the device to a useful state. At this time this is a $50 brick of uselessness stay away until a string of positive reviews begin to surface.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

"Works as advertised, Easy to program",5.0 ,"Here is my two cents on the Wemo light switch. I installed two of them to turn my outside lights on at dusk and off at dawn. -Installation was easy -requires a connection to a neutral wire -will not work with a three way switch -can connect to a ground wire as well but not required. Once installed and the power is turned back on, I downloaded the app from the Play Store (Android). It requires you to connect to the device via its own network. Once done the setup is easy. You need to tell it about your home network and then you're almost done. I did not have to read anything to program it. It was intuitive. However, the switches both required firmware updates to use the Sunrise Sunset function. Updates via your home network in only a few minutes. The switches look good. You can manually override the programming easily at the switch or with the app to turn the lights on or off. I expect I will buy more of these later after I burn these in and see how reliable they are. So far, they are doing exactly what I wanted them to do.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Overall: Great Buy. Works as advertised without any serious complaints.,4.0 ,"Usually I don't purchase items from Amazon that have a rating of less than 4 stars but I decided to give this product a chance as there are multiple factors that could affect each individual user's experience (Strength of WIFI signal, whether or not the product was installed correctly, etc.) Overall, I like this product. After buying the first switch, I waited for a week to get a good feel of whether or not it would perform as advertised and without some of the negative issues that I've seen in other reviews. I was satisfied so I decided to buy 4 more. Ease of installation: There's a steep learning curve with installing this product. The first device took around 45 minutes to install. That included researching youtube videos that explained how to install a regular light switch into a 3 panel box and following the videos on the WeMo website. I would compare the installation of this product with the installation of an overhead fan or replacing a thermostat. By far the most time consuming part is making sure that everything fits within the box. The subsequent installations took less and less time. It would've been nice if the WeMo website had multiple videos for the most common installation scenarios. Software Setup: The setup isn't complicated, however, it would've been nicer if you could push one button and it takes care of the entire setup within a few seconds. Instead, you have to navigate back and forth between the wireless network and the app. My biggest complaint here was that the software updates took a few minutes for each light. Overall, the setup is easy, I just think that it could've been easier. Aesthetic: The toggle and face plate are aesthetically pleasing. Trouble Shooting: There have been a few occasions when the power to the house has turned off and on. Once the modem and router have restarted the WeMo light switches haven't had any problem reconnecting to the internet and resuming their schedule for the most part. So far any connectivity issues I've had with the light switch were initiated by the wireless network going down. I've found that the simplest fix was just to reboot the router and the WeMo does the rest as far as connecting me again. App: The app is intuitive and easy to navigate through. It's IFTTT compatible meaning you can use the IFTTT app to do some cool things. Ex.) When I press and hold any one of my lights for more than a few seconds I receive a phone call on my phone. (Useful if you misplace your phone inside your house) This doesn't justify spending the money on one of these lights but it's an added perk if you're trying to decide between a wirelessly controlled light or something like the honeywell econoswitch. I would've given this product 5 stars if it were cheaper, the video showing the physical installation of the product was more helpful and if the updates didn't take so long.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great light switch,5.0 ,"Love this device... easy to setup, works great with Amazon Echo... I use it every day and love it. I tested it with full power failure in the house and after power is restored it remembers its settings (however obviously won't work without power and can't be controlled remotely when there's no WiFi network). The only problem I had with it, is it was replacing a traditional light switch, however this one not only has a wider rocker so the double-gang wall plate needed updated, but also the electronics in this device are in a box behind the switch, so I actually had to cut some tile on my wall to get this to fit in the spot. Still would buy another knowing that though. I'm gonna buy more.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
So the plugs have pretty much become an expensive way to remotely turn on/off ...,3.0 ,"I bought 3 of these about 2 months ago. I haven't had a chance to explore using them until recently. As many other reviewers have stated, my Wemo mini plugs will not allow me to save any rules. I did a web search, and many other users have been having the same problem, particularly from iPhones. There is no way to try to make rules on the website or on an iPad. So the plugs have pretty much become an expensive way to remotely turn on/off my lamps. Without being able to save rules, I cannot have them turn on automatically according to a schedule or according to sunset or turn off according to bedtime, etc. What a waste of money. I can't even return them now. Belkin technical support gives people the run around (usual...reset the password, reset router, reset phone) and they have yet to come up with a firmware solution. UPDATE 10-11-2017. Okay, I think I figured out how to get the thing to work properly. After installing the Wemo and getting the app up and running, the Wemo will do a firmware update. You would think that this is the end of the install process but it isn’t. After the firmware update, unplug the Wemo, and plug it back in while holding the power button. This will do a factory reset. After doing this process, the device now allows me to save rules. Finally!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
LOVE LOVE....not so much.,3.0 ,"Update: These wemo switches are not as great as I initially reviewed. I had two in place at the time I wrote my initial review (one that plugs in and one of the switches). As noted below, my house was recently re-wired so I was excited to have wemo switches all over the house. Since I wrote my initial review, I purchased two more wemo switches, and had them professionally installed by an electrician. About a month or so later, I, along with most of the state, lost power during a heavy storm. Two of the three switches have not worked properly since, and the third is off and on the fritz. The two which do not work won't appear consistently in the phone app that allows me to remotely control the switches. All three switches will frequently just stop working even when I manually try to turn on the light. This means I have a $50 switch in the wall that is completely useless and a room in which I cannot turn on the light at all. We have reset and restarted the switches multiple times, adjusted the router, and updated the software. None of it has cured the problem. Belkin was less than helpful the several times we contacted them. I now have $150.00 of usually useless light switches installed in my home that I will eventually have to remove since, you know, I can't even manually turn on the light most of the time. I left this review at 3 stars because when the damn things work, they work great. I have had no issue at all with the wemo that plugs into the outlet. These wemo switches are great, and I love them. I have an older house and had the electric redone (finally) just so I could put them in. Not only is the electric now up to date, but I can use the wemo switches and I love them. They are certainly a little pricey, but I have found them to be totally worth the money.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
mini smart plug keep going offline 10 to 15 min after connecting to the network,2.0 ,I got for 2 days and this smart plug keeps getting offline every 10 to 15 mins. Then I will need to unplug and plug it back in to get it back online again. I have the old wemo smart plug and that one never had the same issue.... I am not sure if this is a bad unit or what. And I cant find anywhere on Belkin's website to contact them for support either....,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Skip other Wemo Switches and get this one,5.0 ,"Forget the other wemo switches - this is the least annoying to set up and takes up the least amount of space leaving other outlets free. Their other plugs are so huge that they will block other outlets on the wall or on a power strip. The wemo that tells you the energy consumption of the device plugged into it, seems like a great idea but in reality I only ever checked it once or twice. So save money and get this one instead. I got 2 and one needed to have me factory reset it several times before the app could find it. The other worked great right away. Works great with Alexa. Highly recommend.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great product totally worth buying.,5.0 ,"Great product does exactly what you want it to. I have my Bedroom TV plunged in and when I’m ready to hit the sack I just tell Alexa to turn on TV, that way I don’t get too awake having to fiddle with remotes. I did have a problem recently when I purchased a new modem and router. The instructions from WeMo didn’t work, but I solved my problem by going to U tube and searching for how to reset WeMo plug in and switch. I have the switch too and it is wonderful, it now automatically turns on my outside lights every evening.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Easy to setup and works great,5.0 ,"I really like the WEMO ecosystem of products. The plug works great, setup without any issues, and the app is great. I bought this for the AWAY mode feature (randomly turns on devices to simulate use while away from home) and it works great. Very easy to setup and use, and works great with Alexa. Very happy with purchase.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Fantastic product and super stylish. Amazing design,5.0 ,"Just got this product a few days ago, not an electrician but it was super super easy to swap existing switch. Got a different wifi light switch before but had to returned when I saw that this one has the dimmable option. Pros: The product itself look really futuristic (star trek kind of light switch), recognize light touch to increase or decrease light intensity. The soft light underneath of switch adds a really stylish touch to the product, besides it changes color to indicate in what function it's working ""WHAT????"" Wifi connectivity is really good and the functionality with your smartphone is awesome. Lot of features, rules, modes, etc. Cons: Only one but is not a deal breaker, doesn't work with Siri, only with Alexa. (Apple haters lol) Overall this product is super cool, add a really nice touch to the house I wish WEMO had more products available, like a door bolt or something to control entrance to the house, like that I could keep all my smart home products under the same app.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Two Wemo Dimmer Wi-Fi Light Switches,5.0 ,"I bought two of these dimmer switches on a whim, and got lucky. I have a 100 year old house, that was renovated 40 years ago. After removing asbestos and paneling, I installed new recessed lighting where I had none before. My luck involved having already purchased dimmable lights, and deciding to have two switches control different parts of the room. Both switches were on the line coming from the power source, so I had a neutral (white) line available. Connecting to my CenturyLink Wi-Fi router worked without a hitch. Somewhere in there I entered the Wi-Fi password; and the WeMo iPhone App found both switches, allowed me to connect to them and rename them to meaningful names. When I downloaded the app to another phone in the household, it immediately found both switches and worked as well as the on the first phone. The Smart features of the switches work as advertised. I can control them from my phone, even when away from the house I (I'm not sure how secure that is.) Full control of the dimming feature works, and I can schedule the lights to go on or off in any manner imaginable. Even using the switches in ""dumb"" mode (e.g., pressing the light switch) has a smart feature -- the switches work together to act as a three-way switch for all the lights in the room. These are my first attempts at Smart appliances in the house, but I'm happy with both the installation and the usage. I'm already thinking of other places in the house that can use a Smart switch.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Entry level home automation at it's finest,5.0 ,"I often work long hours and get home well after the sun has gone down. My loving wife will turn on the porch light hours before I get home, to avoid forgetting when it's dark, so I don't have to fumble for my keys in the dark. I know I know, just get your keys together BEFORE you get out of the car. I do, and we have a motion sensor light on the front of the house as well. Evidentially that is not comfort enough for my wife. My last name is not ""PG&E"", so it kills me to know that ""we"" keep the light on for hours because I'm not afraid of the dark?! I bit the bullet as a way to finally win this argument. Now I can safely turn the light on myself when I'm a block from the house, but I don't, because I am not afraid of the dark. More importantly, with the ""recipe"" options readily available, I was able to set it up so the light turns on for my wife when she is at a specific place & distance from the house based on her iPhone's gps.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Ridiculous how great it is to not have to flip a light switch,5.0 ,"I love this light switch. I haven't turned on or off my front porch lights for several months now; yet they are always on when it is dark outside, and off when it is light outside. It sounds ridiculous, but the convenience of the lights turning themselves on and off automatically is truly fantastic. The installation is a breeze. Well, as long as there is power (likely a white wire) to your box already. If not, then get ready to pull more wire or hire an electrician to pull more wire. You can't install the switch if your existing switch only has two black wires. The master bedroom overhead switch, unfortunately, only had two black wires. So that install is still pending. But the porch light install was quick and easy. Turn off the power at the breaker box (important!), then turn a few screws, and the install is complete. The WeMo app is very easy to use. It lets you name--and even add a picture of--each of the lights in your house. You can set up independent rules for them, so they turn on and off on their own schedules. You can also always turn them on and off manually as well. The rules can be dynamic as well, instead of just fixed times. For example, after inputting your location, you can have the lights turn on and off based on sunset/sunrise times, which obviously change throughout the year. You can also do custom times based on sunrise/sunset (e.g., 10 mins after sunset). The light looks good on the wall as well. I was worried at first that it would look a little ridiculous, but it blends in nicely, and I don't even notice it on the wall anymore. I do notice, however, how nice it is that my front porch lights are always on when I want them to be on, and off when it's light outside. Because flipping that switch is seriously pesky.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Perfect for Alexa and IFTTT,4.0 ,"Bought this to replace my switch in my garage. Now I can turn lights on using Alexa voice command. Was planning on setting up IFTTT with MyQ garage, but MyQ is having issues. My only complaint is that the wifi icon was broken. Sensor worked fine but the icon only showed half the wifi symbol. Not a big deal since once it is setup you don't see the icon anymore. Setup through WEMO app was simple. My original switch only had 2 wires connected so I had to use common sense to install but it works fine.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Works great, only missing one option, a ""restart"" function instead of just on and off",4.0 ,"I love this little thing. I recently moved my cable modem downstairs and as many of you know, cable internet often requires power cycling the modem on a regular basis. I've set a schedule to power cycle it every day at 3 in the morning and my internet has never worked better or more reliably. The only thing this is missing is a ""reboot"" function. If I am home, I can power it off and back on without issue since my wifi stays on however if I do it remotely, once it turns off, I can't turn it back on.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
NEEDS A SOFTWARE UPGRADE -- 5/31/2015 GOT THE UPGRADE !!,3.0 ,"I like this switch, used it today to run my fan for a few hours. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is, it has no timer, I would like to set the fan to run two hours and turn off. I wrote to Belkin and their answer was ""use the scheduler function"" this may be fine for a light but not for a cooling fan. Each day is different hot or cool and each time a different run time period is needed, a pre planed schedule will not work. I was very disappointed by their glib answer to a problem which many of us have. Sense the switch is internet connected a simple upgrade should be little problem. If they care about their costumer satisfaction disappointed UPDATE: In a recent upgrade to their software there is a new feature that allows us to set and store a preset time for the light/fan to run. Often when I go to bed the room is warm. Now I have the fan set to run 1 hour to cool the room and sooth me to sleep. I usually fall asleep before the fan turns off.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Frustrating,2.0 ,"It works well but takes a bit longer to do the initial setup than the TP-Link mini plug. It had trouble connecting to my network.

"Super useful, sometimes shuts off unexpectedly, but I'm still buying another one!",4.0 ,"I use this to restart my super fancy litter box, that sometimes likes to get stuck on its side while sifting. The cats really hate it when I'm gone all day, and the litter box is stuck! So I keep tabs on it with the security camera, and can operate the outlet from anywhere I can get a phone signal. My cats are thankful for that! Downside! Sometimes the plug shuts itself off on its own! If it needs an update, or maybe it's just Thursday, it could randomly turn off sometimes. (Another reason why I have a camera watching it...) I haven't played with the scheduled settings though, so I could possibly remedy that by having scheduled on/off times. I am afraid to have it reset while a cat is in there though... LOL! It will also not turn back on if there has been a power outtage, even after power has been restored. You'll have to push the button, or turn it back on in the app. (When you suddenly realize ""Oh no, the cat box is still off!"") Again, having a schedule programmed will probably remedy this issue. I'm thinking of ordering another one, to have my modem/router on a schedule. Not only would it be useful for ""No internet after 10pm!"" but nobody can hack an offline router either. Though it means I'll be using my cameras less...","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great Switches Especially When Automated Through IFTTT,5.0 ,"We have an entry way with three steps that seem to be in a different spot when it's dark out. I always seem to trip on one of them when I have a handful of something and navigating them in the dark is even worse. The idea of turning the porch lights on from the car when coming home in the dark seemed cool. Ditto with turning them off after getting to the car as I hate the thought of leaving them on just to waste energy. I bought two of these from Amazon and one from Best-Buy with plans to use one for the entry way, one for the garage and one for the driveway lights. I wasn't looking for a switch that has an internet enabled schedule, just something that I could turn off and on remotely and preferably without having to add yet another FOB to my key ring. The WeMo sure seemed to be the ticket. Manual operation when I can reach the switch and remote operation when I am on the other side of the door. Connect them via IFTTT and the whole process is automated. Installing them was pretty easy. The do take up a lot of the junction box but they fit. Wiring them is a breeze as well. Getting them to work was another story though...... My iPad found both switches with no problem. I got the first one to join my home network once I typed in the SSID and password and it worked like a champ. The second switch refused to join the saved network so I typed the SSID and password in manually just like I did the first switch. No go. I had to turn on my SSID broadcast for the silly thing to find and join the very same network that the switch a quarter of an inch away found with no problem. No biggie I think, once it is set, we're good to go. I turned off my SSID radio and thought I was done with this project. (They worked cool!) Interestingly, that night my router dropped its IP so I had to reboot it. Both switches went back to flashing so I did a reset on the first switch which got it to rejoin the network and tried everything but changing religion to get the second one to rejoin. I gave up and manually had to set it up all over again. As before, it refused to join my network unless I broadcast my SSID to get it to join and even with that, it took a couple of tries. Both switches are working now but I am really skeptical over their ability to rejoin should my wifi drop for whatever reason. The thought of having to program them over and over and over again every time I mess with a router, modem or wifi has me dreading things. When they work, they work good so I guess I need to take the good with the bad. I haven't installed the third switch yet as I am thinking about just keeping it for a back-up.... Update. - Firmware fixed the problems reconnecting to the router and they've been functional ever since. Added the third to my back porch so that it automatically turns on when my Ring Stick Up camera detects motion (via IFTTT). Works great. Installed a pair of these in my sons new house as they are the bomb. I'm sold and love them.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Best thing in Home Automation!,5.0 ,"I love my WeMo light switches! I currently have 10 switches in my house using WeMo. I love having remote access to the controls, the timers, and IFTTT compatibility. Belkin has made these so simple to install, there is no need to hire an electrician. Installation takes about 5 minutes. Usually followed by about a 10 minute firmware upgrade. Compatibility with Amazon Echo makes turning the lights on in another room as easy as saying ""Alexa, tuen on the kitchen lights"" or as we did for Christmas. ""Alexa, turn on Christmas"" This would turn on our tree, lights around the windows, and lights outside with one simple command! Once you get used to having them, you will never want to go back to the old plain switches.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Love it. Works with Alexa on Echo,5.0 ,"These switches work great. I recently bought an Amazon Echo and this switch works great with Alexa. The only disappointment is that it does not offer any dimming capability. Also, the switch is a little odd in that you press on the bottom of the switch to turn it on and off.

It's just different, but it works great.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

EZ to configure smart plug,4.0 ,"This is the first 'smart' plug I've ever purchased although I have over a dozen various other devices (Mac, iPad, iPhone (2), Apple TV (2), Amazon Echo, Piper security, etc., connected to the internet. The instructions are VERY clear for configuring the Wemo Mini Smart Plug to my Wi-Fi network. I especially like the newer 'mini' as it only 'fills' one of two female 110V sockets leaving the other free for other uses.

IMHO it's well worth buying","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Very easy to install,4.0 ,"Very easy to install. It works terrifically with Alexa as well. The only small issue I ran into, is that I installed it on a double switch, next to a standard dimmer switch (not on Wemo) and the screws don't line up perfectly, so I just replaced the standard double light switch plate with a screwless plate (no screws showing on the outside), so that the slight different wasn't so obvious. Very happy with this switch. I just ordered a standard Light Switch for my front door lights.

For some reason, though, they are terribly inconsistent on internet connection, and somehow seem to reset and fail to run the programs, so that I have to reset and reload them. It's possibly user error or network error, though, so I'll keep trying to get them in order. Edit - Had a bit of time to work it out, and it looks like it was an error with my own setup.

Easy install and set up,4.0 ,"Installed 2 switches in the same switch box without a problem. I think as long as the original electrical job was done nearly it shouldn't be a problem. I am comfortable doing electrical and computer stuff so I was not intimidated doing this project. I realized very quickly that installing 2 in the same box at the same time required paying attention to what box I pulled each out of. The serial number is what pops up in the wifi settings which is also on a sticker on the box . Not the Mac address on the front of the outlet. When you are programming the ""name"" of the switch it is helpful to know which is which. Easy enough to figure out with the blinking lights of the one I was working with first though. Not a major issue. Programming was easy and so was updating as long as you are patient. I was concerned as to how my wife would be able to connect with her iphone after I had used mine to set them up. Apparently when you download the app on the same wifi it automatically picks up the outlets on that router. We just downloaded the app and both switches magically appeared. So, 2 days and really no issues. Hope things work as advertised for years to come. I have noticed sometimes there is a delay on the app. I have to hit the button twice sometimes to turn on/off. Probably an app issue but not sure. It hasn't been a real problem just wanted to mention it. I have to stop and remember that these ""high tech"" devices are fairly new and there are lots of variables at play. Switches, apps, Internet connections, and signal strengths.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
it works but better choices,3.0 ,"these switches do work but the android app is horrible (I think the ios app is better) I've had two of the wall switches for almost a year and they are working well for the most part -- I use them as outside light control and the one killer feature they have is you can set them to go on a 'dusk' (they know where they are so they calculate that) That seems to work pretty well if you use it from the IOS side -- From the android side it's a bit of a mess. So it's somthing that does what it says and the way I use it (set and forget) it's working well (by the way -- it acts like a regular wall switch also) so what's not to like? Well as I've alluded to the app is horrible on the android side.. also for a few bucks more you can get a lutron switch with a remote that integrates with a wink hub and gives you a ton of extra features (like dimming) and so far that setup seems to work better and allows for true home automation (turn switches on in gangs or on a schedule or when I get home, etc) So yes -- feel free to buy it and you'll probably be happy enough but I'll probably not buy any more.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

WeMo Mini is not ready for prime time,2.0 ,"I love my smart home, but sometimes it can be a bit trying. Out of all my smart devices the WeMo line is the one I can always count on to work as intended. Updated 05/25/2017. I wrote the above based on my experience with the WeMo Insight smart plugs and really should have waited to evaluate the new Mini. The WeMo Insights are completely reliable, have never failed to turn off or on according to their routines. I now own 2 Mini plugs that I have been struggling to justify. The Mini plugs were great at first and worked as expected, but in the past 3 months have proved nothing but difficult. The first signs of trouble were the fact that they had difficulties maintaining a connection to the WeMo app. Not a bid deal, just unplug them and plug them back in and it is solved... at least for the next 24 hours or so. They would still adhere to their schedule, which is my biggest concern. A pain, but manageable. Now they are refusing to turn on/off according to their routines. I can still turn them on/off remotely, but I have to babysit them each and every day to ensure they are on/off when they should be, that is when they connect to the app. I have decided to remove the Mini plugs and replace them with something more reliable. I will keep the plugs to revisit them in a few months to see if Belkin has fixed their firmware/software, but they will never be attached to an appliance that is of any importance.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

"Very easy to install. Works as advertised. A bit simple, but powerful enough smartphone application.",5.0 ,"I bought this wall switch and one wall outlet switch at the same time. I thought the wall switch would be less useful and the one you just plug into any outlet more practical. In my case it was the other way around. This wall switch is simply great. It has a green light that shows when it's on, so you can easily just click on it on the wall or via your smartphone and you will never worry if it is on or off, that is very clearly shown both on the smartphone app and on the wall by the green light. The switch that goes into any outlet works great, but for lights it turns out that if someone turns off the actual light rather than using the WeMo, then the next time you turn on the WeMo, and the light is off (if a light is what you use it for), then of course the light won't go on. I have two kids and a wife and it is not possible to know if they will remember to use the app rather than just turning the light on or off. Both models were easy to install. Very easy in fact. I find the app a bit bare bones, but it works very well. It has a timer setting that I really like - it's from ""sunset"" to whatever time you program. It will handle the sunset as per where you live - it works great! For my use it does exactly what I need. The outdoor lights are on when it's dark until 11:30PM every night and one light is on in the hallway during the same time period so I don't have to walk into a dark home. I can check the light from anywhere in the world and it is a great comfort feeling to know that the house and the router and ultimately the lights are still there and working while I am not home. I will probably buy more of the model that you replace your wall switch with - I find that very practical and better integrated in the real use environment where you sometimes want to use the app but also often simply want to hit the switch on the wall. Great product, highly recommend for anyone that wants to automate anything electrical in your home.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
WEMO is Awesome - I speak and it does.,5.0 ,"This is an awesome switch. I hooked it up to my fan and I can simple ask Alexa to turn the fan on or off. The instructions doesn't say it but I can tell you know, if you have 2 black wires going into your fan switch meaning you probably have a separate light switch for the fan, then as weird as this sounds, Hook up one black wire to the fan and the other black wire from Wemo to the white neutral wire and the Wemo white wire to the ground wire. The green wire on Wemo just put a wire cap on it and a wire cap on the other hot black wire that isn't going to be used. This will work the fan. I had to search all over the web to find this answer and thought I'd share it here.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Good Product, Terrible Support",2.0 ,"I purchased two of these switches. They're not difficult to install, as switches go. They're a little big, and it was a bit of a challenge to fit it into the electrical box. I like the lighting... there's a green light in the little black circle on the front when on, and a tiny white light when off. You really can use these to find the switch easily in the dark. Nice design touch. I use the iOS app to control the switches. It's slow and a bit poorly thought out (for instance, there seems to be no way to remove an existing switch from the app, as I wished for later; the app takes way too long to start up and see the switches, even over a speedy network), but it eventually gets the job done. However, when one of the switches stopped working four months after purchase, my experience with getting a replacement was awful. I contacted technical support by e-mail. They asked me to re-try troubleshooting steps I had already tried, but to no avail. There were several days between each round of e-mail correspondence with technical support, but they did finally approve a warranty replacement. After getting this approval, technical support had me call their customer support number. They took about half an hour to even answer the phone. Even after they did, they repeatedly put me on hold to ""double-check"" this or that. The whole call took just over an hour. They did finally send out a replacement (which has worked fine), but it took so long for the product to arrive that I will have to send the product back using expedited shipping to avoid having my credit card charged for the replacement. And, no, they're not covering the return shipping either. I hope Belkin can improve its support. With more responsive and efficient support and an improved app experience, this product could deserve four or even five stars.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Nice Product But Software Needs A Little Work,3.0 ,"I really like this product but Belkin has yet to perfect the rules software that allows you to program it to come on and off using the sunrise/sunset time option which adjust itself by a minute or two on a daily basis to keep up with the ever changing solar time. Also sometimes the rule that you have set up will not turn the lights on or may not turn the lights off as planned-but that is far and few between. Bottom line the product works great 90% of the time. It's the other 10% that really annoys me, but because I like the product so much I tolerate it. That's why it only gets a 3 star rating. If it worked as advertised I would give it a 5. I really like the fact that I can control the lights via the WEMO app on my iPhone. Also if you do not use the sunrise/sunset setting in the app to control when the lights go on and off, but rather use a specific time for it to come on and a specific time to go off, it works great. With all that said, I would still buy this product again.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Recommend it.,5.0 ,"I read several complaints about this plug being difficult to set up. When I started setting it up, I began to see the problem. I noticed that the instructions on the Wemo app differed from the written instructions in the box, so I tried the instructions from the video. I had to plug and unplug the device a couple of times, and it worked like a charm. Took about 10 minutes. Great device!! By the way, one confusing thing is what happens during the setup: when you are setting this up, your phone will say that you are not connected to the internet. That is correct. Don't worry when you see that; just keep moving forward and your Wemo will be fine.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great remote switch!,5.0 ,"We have two of these, and use one with the light in our toddler's bedroom. It took my wife a little while to adjust to not turning off the night light's switch manually. But now she really likes the ability to remotely control the switch. It's great, because if we forgot to turn on the light, we can turn it on remotely without having to go back into the room and risk waking up our toddler. The second one is in our media room. This has been really nice, as I can flip the light on once the TV goes off, then turn it off remotely through the app when I get to the next room. No more tripping through the dark room in the middle of the night! The switches were easy to setup too. The app walks you through connecting them to your wifi, and away you go.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
A must for any home-automation enthusiast,4.0 ,"I received and installed this switch yesterday in my kitchen because of florescent tube lighting that cannot be replaced with any ""smart bulbs"" on the market. It installs easily enough - the long wires on the back make wiring it easier than a traditional switch, but the app/wireless setup is a little frustrating. When powered for the first time, it broadcasts its own wireless SSID so that you can connect your device to and configure with the Wemo app. Unfortunately, because of how newer versions of Android handle wireless networks with no Internet connection, my phone refused to stay connected to it unless I turned off cellular data too. This information is nowhere in the documentation of this device, and I only knew to do that because I had to do the same thing with my Ring doorbell earlier in the week. I've already set it up to work with my Amazon Echo, and it's scheduled to turn on about the time that I get to the kitchen on mornings before work. It's the little touches though - like the faint glowing dot so you can find the switch when it's dark - that make this a great buy. If you have any home automation in the plans, this is a must.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Best wifi plug on the market.,5.0 ,"I bought this to integrate the guts into another smart home project. The improved V2 mini is definitely much improved and also MUCH more tamper proof. If you are buying this for the guts, be prepared to bend the face plate off and unsolder the terminals to get the board out. All in all, product works flawlessly and is great to use for a simple arduino activated smart home device. *Tip, use a 5V power supply plugged in to the Wemo and use that on/off (5VDC) as your DigitalRead pin signal. Easier than taking it apart!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great - if you like setting your device up multiple times each month.,2.0 ,"When this product works, I like it. I have it paired with a Google Home. I can ask Google to turn the light on and off, which is really convenient. However, the WeMo app sometimes can't find the device and I have to physically hold down a button and restart and setup the device again to get it to function. This takes an annoyingly long time, which would be okay if it was once, but I have now done this over 10 times (prompting me to write this review). For this much money, this device should work. Period. To make it more fun, the Google Home often can't find the WeMo Switch on random days. Is it a Google thing or a WeMo thing? Probably both. I've read others with the same problem, and I suggest another smart switch from another maker.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
When this mini smart plug came out I ordered it immediately,5.0 ,"I was waiting for a Wi-Fi enabled plug that did not rely up on a hub to function and was low profile. When this mini smart plug came out I ordered it immediately. My intention was to use with Amazon Echo (and I do) but I also found it very useful to turn lights on before I come in the house and also as a typical timer for when I am away. I changed the ""name"" of the plug several times to work best with the Echo. So far the plug has been very consistent, stays on the wifi, works remotely and with the Echo. I'll probably get more. The price is right.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Easy to install for a novice; peace of mind.,5.0 ,"This product is amazing and easy to install. The most I've ever done remotely electrical has been to install batteries so I was surprised how easy this was to install. I read the other reviews and was a little nervous about the product not working, but followed the instructions to the T and had two switches installed and online within 40 minutes. People seem to be frustrated about linking the switch or continious restarting however I have not had those issues yet (had the product for about a month). It did take two tries to connect the app to the first switch - but went smoothly after that. It gives me that added peace of mind to be able to turn the lights on from anywhere I want (works perfectly on cellular network). I will be purchasing more in the future. ==================================================================================================== Update 3/17 Its been a couple months, had several power outages, router resets, but still works great!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
and I can’t connect that hub to Amazon because it creates a duplicate of each smart object in your house,5.0 ,"I had a zigbee or zwave, whatever, outlet lying around and wanted to use it to switch my Rancilio Silvia on for four hours each morning. That worked, but I could only expose it to Alexa through SmartThings, and I can’t connect that hub to Amazon because it creates a duplicate of each smart object in your house. I’m sick of hitting “forget” 76 times every time I do discovery, so I needed something with native Alexa integration. This works, it does the thing.

Whenever Wemo is brought up, I hear a handful of complaints about connectivity and not being able to manage them remotely. I myself have never experienced this and can attest that the only times I've had issues is when my internet goes down - which is not the products fault! I don't expect Netflix to work when my internet is down - why would my internet connected outlet! Plus, their integration with Alexa and SmartThings make them invaluable in my automation routines. I'll keep buying these till every outlet in my house is remotely controlled :-)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Hardware is good; iOS app response time should be quicker,4.0 ,"I have installed 3 Belkin WeMo light switches in areas that would be convenient to turn on/off remotely. The first location was my front porch lights, the second location was the living room, and the third was the kitchen. The lights are perfect for the porch since I use a rule to turn them on at dusk, and off at 11:30 PM so they don't run all night. Just on long enough that I'm usually home by that time. If I pull in later, I could always turn on the porch lights remotely before I drive up for visible security at night. I like having them installed for the living room and kitchen so I can set up rules to turn on in the evening automatically so my dog can walk around with some decent lights on during waking hours. In terms of installation, the instructions were easy to follow (especially watching the videos on YouTube, but I wish the unit was more slimmer to accomodate wiring behind the light switch. It takes a few minutes to fiddle the best way to hide the electrical wires. For the iOS app (current version 1.4.1), I like the look and UI of the app. Sometimes the light switches are very responsive to turning on/off, and sometimes the light switches take a few seconds to be recognized before turning them on/off. Those few seconds sometimes add up to frustration since immediate response is highly desired. If if weren't for this lag, the entire product would be 5 stars.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
No Brainer home automation,5.0 ,"With words like voice control, Internet control, automation, hubs, ifttt and plenty more technical words being thrown around this might scare some users. FEAR NOT!

Despite all the bad press I had a very easy experience in getting ...,4.0 ,"Despite all the bad press I had a very easy experience in getting this setup. Physical installation was pretty simple given I had the neutral line, the app found the device almost immediately and was up and running. Setup an IFTTT job for a porch light and worked the first time. Maybe I was lucky but this and the WeMo switch worked great. Like any device like this the real test is keeping the wi-fi connection so we'll see how it does long term.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I wish everything was controlled by WeMo,5.0 ,"I love my WeMo system. This is the third component I've acquired, and I recommend it to all who see it in my home. This switch I used for the front light of the house - I don't have a motion sensor on it, and I didn't want a timer that just went sunset to sunrise - it is still too much energy waste, in my opinion. I set the timer for whatever times I see fit, and I can have it go off right before bed. I can also use the switch on the fly, and change it from my mobile device, even if I am away from my home. There are two difficulties with the system. It doesn't always connect via wifi on the first shot. I usually have to try 2-3x before it takes. Once it connects though, it seems to be good to go. The second flaw is the app updates for my iphone. It seems to mess with my timers, and I usually have to reset them all. A small price to pay, as long as I remember.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Very good connected switch, works great with Amazon Echo!!!",5.0 ,"When I read some of the other reviews, I was worried that the firmware updates might cause some issues for me. I bought four of these to control the outside lights on my house, and they have been working great for more than a month now. I think that Belkin has resolved the firmware issues other reviewers talked about, and I have even had them go through a second update (after the initial one that ran at installation) without any issues. I have had to restart a few of the switches in order to make them reconnect to my router after I changed some settings, but otherwise they have worked very well. If you are looking for a solid system to begin connecting you lights to your network, these are a great choice. The added bonus is they are very easy to set up with Amazon Echo. I simply logged into my Echo app, and built a group with all of my outside lights. I can easily turn them on or off as a group from my iPhone or by asking Alexa to take care of it for me. Definitely a step into the future!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I like it.,4.0 ,"So far so good. Right off the bat iIt took a few tries to pair it with the WiFi. I had to try moving it to another outlet for it to finally work. Try this and don't plug anything into it until you've got it set up. The app interface is a bit clunky, but it integrates will with IFTTT. I've got it set up to turn a lamp on when my security camera detects movement, and also on a set schedule. It's not a ""necessity,"" but it is a cool gadget. I'd check out the IFTTT recipes before you buy. Obvious useful ones would be to turn on a lamp when you get home and turn it off when you leave, or turn on a radio or TV when a connected sensor detects motion.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Very good product!,5.0 ,"Excellent product. I have a bunch of these things and all work great. I like these over the other devices because they work off wi-if. I have them paired with my Echo and the voice recognition has been flawless. These, as well as the light switches, really make things easier. I may sit down to watch a movie and forget to turn off the lights, or have my hands full while leaving the room and I just say "" Alexa, turn off -- which ever one I want"". You can give any name you want to each device. Definitely worth it.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works as advertised,5.0 ,"I have only had this for a few days so can't speak to longevity or it's sensitivity to voltages variations. Wanted to add lighting automation to our home security system and the WeMo system seemed like a simple solution. I purchased one light switch as a trial. My assessment: 1) Very simple to install (I know basic wiring requirements); 2) Finding/downloading the app onto iPad and iPhone was quick & easy (iPhone app is used on both iPhone & iPad); 3) The switch is quite large and getting it into the switch box took some effort (had to use smaller wire nuts and push the wiring as far back into the box as possible); 4) The light can be controlled via app from anywhere you can find a hot spot (or use cell data time) - turned off/on or programmed; 5) The programming is simple and intuitive. The advantages of this device are that it can be controlled remotely and/or programmed. I think the WeMo products are pretty expensive for what it is and does. Wireless technology is well integrated into our everyday lives and, like all technology, is getting less expensive over time. I purchased the WeMo on sale and will wait for another sale before dishing out $50 for the next switch. The down side is that most of the switches in my home are 3 way (2switches control one light) and the WeMo switch can not be used in this application. Read the WeMo installation requirements and check your wiring before you purchase.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The second time is a charm,3.0 ,"The switch is a good idea, but the quality control at the factory could be improved. I ordered a light switch and installed in properly...it simply would not connect with the WeMo program or, if it did, it lost that connection shortly thereafter. I finally gave up and returned it requesting a replacement. That replacement was wired in exactly as the other, works perfectly and is a delight to have working with Alexa... I note that others have had similar comments about bad switches so if you order one, be prepared for a possible dud. Having said that, in fairness, I will note that I have ordered another (I hope they don't send me my old one - grin)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
WeMo Mini Plug Not so Mini,4.0 ,"Not bad but leaves room for improvement. The plug on the back should be able to rotate so I can place this in a vertical or horizontal position. The plug should also be at one end of the switch, rather than the middle. The switch is so wide and takes up so much real estate that I was very limited on where I could place it. It was very easy to set up initially. The app on the iPhone is intuitive and good. However, the ""away"" mode is completely random and can not be managed; it is either on or off. I would prefer the ability to set my own schedule. I really don't need my lights to come on at noon if I am away; but I would like to know that they came on at 5pm, 8pm and 10 pm (or similar). Unfortunately, when creating a manual rule you are limited to a single on/off time. This is my first automation tool to work with Amazon echo. That functionality works well. I started with WeMo because it was less expensive and could be easily expanded. However, with the 2 shortcomings above I probably would not purchase another one.

Easy to setup and program schedules. But does not work for multi-home or with wifi extenders,3.0 ,"I had previously purchased two Wemo light switches for my primary residence and I found they worked well for turning on the porch light and patio light at sunset. I have a hot water recirculation pump at my vacation home, so I thought a Wemo smart plug would be perfect for disabling the pump while I am away using my phone and the Wemo app to turn it off and on. Unfortunately I discovered that the plug would not setup when I tried to go through the installation process. Turns out, the Wemo app requires all of your devices to be on the same Wifi network and it will not let you manage devices in multiple homes, the way nearly all IoT products these days do. Nest, Rachio, ecobee, ADT, Rheem ecoNet, you name it, I have them and use them to manage both of my homes. Turns out Wemo doesn't work for me like all these other smart devices. I wound up purchasing an Iris at the Lowe's hardware store and it was half the price of this Wemo switch and did the same thing.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

You can't set up a second device without disconnecting from your cell network (turning on airplane mode) if you have an existing device with Remote Access turned on. This is because to set up a new device you connect to it with your phone's wifi and open the WeMo app to begin initialization. Except that when I open the WeMo app, it just shows me the existing plug I have and there's no way to set up a new device in the options.

Automate Your Home - Integrates With Amazon Echo,5.0 ,"Installation was fairly simple. If you know how to wire a light switch, you will have no issue with this switch. It does require a neutral wire, but I doubt many people do not have a neutral wire these days. If you have an older home, you might check first to make sure. After installing the switch, it takes less than 5 minutes for everything to sync up. The included instructions are clear and easy to understand. I also have an Amazon Echo, the integration was quick and simple. Excellent product. I did buy a new face-plate because it was installed in a 3 gang box due to the ceiling fan.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Recommended and fun,5.0 ,"This is my first Smart Home product of this type. I wanted something that worked with Alexa to turn on lights that were a bit difficult to reach easily. Setup was relatively painless and both devices are performing exactly as I had hoped. No hubs necessary so installation was that much easier. It is convenient and great fun to ask Alexa to turn on the lights. The switch is low profile and attractive. It does not block the second socket in a two socket wall plate, something that makes my wife very happy. I haven't tried any advanced features like turning on or off away from home or scheduling on or off times but I am confident it will work well in those scenarios. I would recommend this product and plan to buy a few more. I think the product would be great for older folks as well so they can have a little more control of their environment.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Once you get past setup it works fine,3.0 ,"Bought two when they were on sale for $40. Physical setup was fairly easy. I don't have much experience with electrical but was able to figure it out in 15 min then crossed fingers and switched breaker at the panel and voila it worked. Well, the first one worked for five minutes and then I was not able to find the wifi signal of the device anymore through my wifi on ipad iPhone and laptop. I was in the process of setting up the password for the router when it stopped sending a wifi signal. I reset it a few times, took the power off and then put the second one in and that one did work. I am amazed that the remote ability worked without a problem. For my other devices that was always a hassle to do with port forwarding. With this one you just flick a ""switch"" in the settings and then it's a go. I can now turn everything from far away. Will send the first one back to Amazon (exchange not refund) and then see how long this will keep on working. If it does then for sure I'm getting a few extra.. Only three stars for problems with installing. My tip: buy at least two and install within 30 days so you can return the bad ones with amazon return policy and also don't bother putting it in the electric box until the thing is totally setup and works for a while. It's a hassle exchanging them..","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Once connected, it's great.",4.0 ,"The first time I tried to set it up, it failed to connect once I was in the Wemo app. It tried to connect to cellular and never successfully connected back to my Wi-Fi network. I didn't have time to troubleshoot until two days later. Two days later, I tried it again. Again, it failed at first. After the 3rd time, it finally seemed to take. I don't remember doing anything different except to keep trying. Now that it's connected, it's great. I have a rule set up and it works like a charm. I also have the Insight. Unless you need to monitor the usage, I would recommend the mini.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Work great with built in timer utility,5.0 ,"I'm a bit of a techy nerd and an early adopter. I was actually looking for a better programmable timer switch for my outside flood lights when I ran across this switch. I have an old house and the switches are in rather bad locations. So this switch solves two problems. The utility on my iPhone lets me switch the lights on from wherever I am. The timer utility allows me to schedule the lights to go at dusk, yes dusk, and turn off at 11pm and turn back on at 6am and turn of at dawn. The utility uses published sunrise and sunset data matched to my zipcode to determine dawn and dusk. And it works great. Install was easy. Granted, I do my own electrical work, but it's only 3 connections and you're done. The programming was also very easy, straight forward and well described. Make sure you have a reasonable Wi-Fi signal at the site.I have had these installed for a year and they're still going strong. I would recommend these.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great for lights that can't use smart bulbs.,4.0 ,"This switch works exactly as expected. It blends in nicely without looking too ""techy"" as many smart products do. Installation is easy if you know what you're doing, but I could see it being complicated if you've never done electrical work before. However, I'm nowhere near electrician status and I was able to install it without issue. The only thing that would make me like it more is HomeKit compatibility, but I understand why this product doesn't offer it. I knew that before my purchase and I'm still satisfied.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Like most people,5.0 ,"A few weeks ago, when I first got these plugs, I connected it to my Google Home. Like most people, I connected lights to it. Setup was easy through the App but I was immediately frustrated by the inability for Google Home to identify this device as a ""light"" and instead I had to call it a ""plug"". What really got me frustrated is that you can give the device a nickname (ex: ""light one"") but if the nicknamed was similar to a device it knew, it got confused, even if you didn't have any of the other devices in your home. It drove me nuts and I considered returning the product. However, instead of returning the product, I gave feedback to Google. The Google support person apologized and explained the challenges to me and said that he'd file a ticket...which I interpreted as a polite message to go away. HOWEVER, about a week ago, Google pushed a fix that now lets me call my lights plugged into the Wemo plug ""lights"" and everything works! I can now say ""Okay Google, lights off"" and it'll control all the Wemo plugs in the house. The Wemo app is awesome as is (now) the integration with Google Home!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The WeMo works beautifully. The installation is really easy and should take ...,5.0 ,The WeMo works beautifully. The installation is really easy and should take no more than 10 minutes. The only difficulty was getting all of the wires with wire nuts back in the electrical box. It connected with my wifi right away and then it was discovered by the WeMo app. I bought four more after seeing how simple the install was and how well it worked. I got an Amazon Echo for Christmas and now I can group different lights together and have Alexa(Echo) turn them on and off.

Works 3 out of 4 times. Literally.,3.0 ,"May 4th, 2014 Pros: App gets better with every update, the switches are very beautiful, IFTTT compatible Cons: the switch is huge which makes wiring a pain, customer service is a nightmare if one doesn't work. Love my switches. I own four, one went bad and getting a replacement was kind of a pain because the support people are quick to blame the wiring. They wanted me to hire an electrician to make sure I didn't wire it incorrectly. When I finally manage to convince the guy it was the product, I had to go through the pain of their exchange process which includes them charging me for a unit and shipping until they receive the defective one. I'll update once I get the new one. I posted a chat room pic on my roxietech.tumblr of the conversation. Update: May 27th, 2014 Still haven't received my replacement wemo switch. Spoke to another customer service rep who apologized and said my wemo would arrive in two days. Then, I received an email from customer support saying they need me to call back and further discuss the issue. I'm getting pretty fed up with wemo right now.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Lots of fun, convenient",4.0 ,"I use this with Amazon Echo and it works great! Much better than the other brand I tried. Love being able to turn lights on and off with voice control. Would give 5 stars but every now and then I have to repeat the command even though Alexa recognizes it and says ""OK"". Note: If you set this up using an Android device you may want to ""forget"" the Wemo wifi network on your Android when you are done to be sure it doesn't try to reconnect and cleans up your Android a bit.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Awesome product, works great with Amazon Echo, even works over the internet from anywhere in the world",5.0 ,"This is a great product. Can be programmed from your iPhone to turn on whatever its tied to (our case the outdoor light) randomly, at dawn/dusk, at dusk and stay on for a period of time, etc. The best part for us is it works with our Amazon Echo. I can't hear my husband pull up and say ""Alexa turn on the outside light"" and bam the outdoor light goes on. This product works amazing. I wish half the switches in my house were these (even though they are a tad bit pricey). Its iPhone App works great with this too, and it never seems to have any issues. Best of all, we can turn this on and off through the internet from anywhere in the world. Too bad the WeMo lightbulb kit doesn't work like this...

Awesome!,5.0 ,"Purchased 6 of these to begin automating light controls throughout the house...I freaking LOVE THEM! relatively straightforward and easy to connect, simple console operation via my smartphone (iPhone 6S Plus), and actually saved me money within the 1st month! I went with this model (per reviews) as I'm still able to leverage the plug below (or above) once plugged in...My only (minor) gripe would be adding them to large surge protectors / controls...I'm sure over time, they will continue to shrink these down.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Super smooth, effective and easy to set up",5.0 ,"This is a very well executed product. Of course its a great idea but often with these things the execution of the setup can be highly problematic. From opening the package to having Alexa control a device was about 5 minutes! Wow! I have it personalized as living room lamp, and with Alexa I can say turn the lamp/light/living room lamp/living room light and Alexa will get it right. I can also control it via an app on my iPhone (tho not thru Apple Home)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
when in the cool down cycle,2.0 ,"i have a bottle warmer plugged into the switch. When on, the bottle warmer cycles between 300+ watt draw during heat, and <2w draw when it is in ""cool down"". The warmer cycles back and forth ever 30 seconds or so, for the duration it is switched on. The problem is, when in the cool down cycle, it is causing the wemo to thinks the device is off, when it is not. which both prevents me from turning the warmer off, and resets the auto-off timer countdown, preventing the auto-off from working at all. there is a setting in the the wemo app to lower the 'standy threshold' to 2w, however, being that the warmer draws less than that during its cycle, the setting is of no help. Why is there no option to disable the standby threshold entirely, and turn the switch itself on, or off, regardless of whether it ""thinks"" the attached device is on or off? As it is, the bottle warmer is dangerous to use with the WeMO, as it is possible to turn it on remotely, but run the risk of being unable to turn it back off. If it were to remain on, while we were away from home, the warmer could potentially cause a fire.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
3 star now. Could be a 4 star with a firmware update.,3.0 ,"UPDATE 3/20/2017: As you'll see below the nice folks at Wemo support reached out to ask me about the issue. Support had some good questions, and I felt like they knew what they were doing. I didn't get the usual basic questions about if the Wemo is plugged in. Ultimately I just had to hunker down, and do proper troubleshooting. After about 3 hours I finally narrowed down the basic issue. Some context first. I connect all of my IoT gizmos to an isolated guest network. The idea is if somebody hacks one, they aren't easily getting to my laptops, and other sensitive devices. I have a Netgear R700 Nighthawk router that supports firewalled guest networks to fit this purpose. I noticed in the router logs that the Wemo was actually connecting, and getting an IP address. However the amber light on the plug would keep flashing indicating it didn't think it was connected. What's weird is exactly every 60 seconds I'd see another DHCP request. Weirder yet the first time the Wemo DHCP's it seems to be stable. Ultimately I found that if I went into my guest network settings and checked the box - ""Allow guests to see each other and access my local network"" the Wemo was happy and worked just fine. Something about the added L2 isolation is making the Wemo very upset. Of course leaving this box checked entirely defeats the purpose of the guest network. Ultimately I signed the Wemo onto my private network; let's hope they've done their security homework. I'll give back a star because the plug works and stays connected now, and it seems to be a little more responsive as well. Holding a star off the potential 4 star rating as I have to compromise my network to do it. ==== Original Review 3/11/2017 ==== First, I'll lead with I'm VERY savvy when it comes to IoT products. My company designs and implements hardware and mobile apps for a variety of back office providers (Amazon, Ayla, Photon...). This is my first Wemo product, and overall I'm really disappointed. Wemo was one of the first to market, and a well known brand name. I expected a lot more from a company like Belkin, and a product that has been fielded since the beginning of the IoT rave started. Especially at this price point. All I'm really looking for is a smart plug to automatically power cycle a piece of hardware once a day. And allow me to remotely power cycle it if necessary. Note: my Wi-Fi signal is good. Less than 10 feet from my router. And I have 50Mbps Internet service. My other gizmos and gadgets have great response times so I'm not having trouble with my Internet. The Good: * The product looks professionally done, and feels like good quality construction. * Wi-Fi pairing was really easy. I'm using the iOS app. Belkin could give me a button to launch iOS Wi-Fi settings, and use a captive network to automatically redirect me to the app once you connect to the Wemo's Wi-Fi access point to save me a little work. No big deal though. * I didn't have to create a user account. The last thing I really want is another user account somewhere. * In general, fairly simple and clean app design * Active user community. Belkin's knowledge base is pretty useless, but the community forums are great! The Bad: * Exception to app design: The schedule options were confusing at first. Specifically the ""on until"" option. After a little trial and error I figured it out. * The first time I created a schedule it took a minute to save it. Edits are faster maybe 10 seconds. * Toggling power from my phone is really slow - 10-15 seconds. Not the end of the world, but I hate waiting. The Ugly: * I needed a firmware update right away. Which is fine. Kicked off the update. It sat and spun, and spun, and spun for about an hour. Noticed the LED was blinking amber. Pull up the manual and find out that means it's not able to connect to Wi-Fi. Power cycled the mini and still no connection. Reset via the on/off button. Repaired with the app and it was fine again. * I setup my Wemo on a plug by my desk where it's easy to access and see that it is running the schedule correctly. It's final home will be somewhere that's not as easy to access. When I moved the Wemo to it's new home it came up with the flashing amber light again. No amount of power cycling or fidgeting would get it back onto my router again. I had to reset it and repair it again. * Did some more testing and sure enough - once the power is lost it doesn't reconnect. * I pulled power on my router just to see what would happen and when it came back up the Wemo didn't reconnect in that case either. * Conclusion: If you lose your Wi-Fi connection due to router loss, warm reboot, or cold reboot you have to repair. This is a scenario any IoT product is going to face. Simply unacceptable Belkin would even think of shipping units with this issue. I found a few posts on the community forum with many other people complaining about the same Wi-Fi problem. I'm not alone. If I had frequent power outages the Wi-Fi problem would be a non-starter 1 star rating. I can live with it so I'll go 2 stars. If Belkin can get a firmware fix out so Wi-Fi reconnect is reliable I'd go 4 stars. -1 star for the annoying schedule UI, and slowness.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

I have wemo throughout my house, wish they got more on the other sensors part such as door alarm sensonsore, valves and flood. Also wished they had link to Stringify, not only IFTTT. I still find price a bit high due to competitors pricing; but so far all wemo devises I have had no issues with updates and not broken, so quality and reliability also important.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Appears to have better security than others,4.0 ,"I am happy with this smart plug. Although it took a bit longer to set up, the added security for a smart home device is worth it. I called their support line and got someone on the phone right away. She was helpful and walked me through the process of getting it set up. The app is intuitive and does not ask for unreasonable permissions (although device I tried requires permission to make phone calls). I was also happy to see a firmware update, indicating that they are maintaining it. I was also able to find reports from Belkin (the Wemo manufacturer) indicating that they find and fix security vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity is always important to me, but it is especially important in smart home devices.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Has one major issue,2.0 ,"This switch works as listed. However, the default setting is off. If the power goes off or a light switch is turned off the Wemo switch doesn't come back on until you either push the button on the plug or turn it on through the app. I was planning on putting this on a couple of lamps that I leave on when I travel. The problem is that that you can't reach the plug behind furniture. The plugs are on a wall switch that turns the plug on and off. Every time you turn of the lights with the wall switch you can't turn them on again without the app or reaching down behind furniture. I pulled the plugs out and set them aside. I will use them when I travel. Other than that they are useless to me. The default setting should be whatever it was when the power goes off.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great addition to our Wemo infrastructure,5.0 ,"Added the Mini to our Wemo infrastructure about a month ago. It was easy to setup and easy to reset when we changed the WiFi network name. The small form factor finally made it possible to automate items on that awkward outlet with not enough vertical clearance. While the Insight has been awesome for controlling electric heaters and monitoring the cost to run them, the Mini is great for lights and other appliances that stay in a power on state even when the power control switch is put in an 'on' state. It cannot automate our family room TV though for example, because when the power control goes to off, the TV goes to power off state. I wasn't expecting the Mini to do this, but thought other people might find that information useful. Also, though not specific to the Mini, the Wemo integration with Alexa has been an unexpectedly useful feature. Wemo's rule-based automation is what got us into Wemo, and adding Alexa in a way that doesn't require us to purchase new products is greatly appreciated.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works well these days!,4.0 ,"These are getting better than when I first purchased them a few years ago. It is still somewhat buggy when installing. I have full wifi coverage on my house and it still took about ten tries to get it to connect to my router. This light switch seems to work more reliably than their plug outlet switch. It is somewhat of an investment though, since you decide which brand you want and ultimately are stuck with it. If you are a first time buyer, I would recommend doing your research before committing to any one brand.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Just what I wanted!,5.0 ,"We've had this for about a month; a co-worker recommended it. It wasn't hard to install. The first hookup went just fine. I don't really care about controlling the light remotely, but I did want to program the outdoor lights to go on at sunset and turn off around bedtime. This works just great; very happy. We did lose our home router, and when we got a new router, we inadvertently changed the wireless password. It took a bit of an effort to re-set it for the new system, but we eventually got there. It's just wonderful to have the light go on and off as it should.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The instructions were clear and easy to follow,4.0 ,"Setup of the dimmer was exactly as expected. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. The only grip I have is that the dimmer does not directly integrate with Alexa/Echo like the smart plugs or the regular switch. To use the dimmer with Alexa/Echo you have to connect it via the Wemo ""skill"" which works, but it's a little slower/less responsive then direct integration. Sometimes it can take ~10 seconds for Alexa to turn my lights on since it has to first connect via the app. I can't understand why Alexa can't connect directly to this switch, as Alexa can still only turn it on or off, it cannot control the dimming functions or anything beyond a simple on/off.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo works well but not for unsupervised locations.,2.0 ,"I have been using Wemo extensively in my primary home and have found them to be quite reliable. Between switches and plugs, I am currently using 7 units. I wanted to use them in my vacation home but was disappointed that the Wemo app only allows one location to monitor. So, I monitor one home on my iPhone and the other home is monitored on my iPad. It would be helpful if their app alllowed the monitoring of two or more different locations. Maybe somebody can help make me smarter here? Also, a recent thunderstorm and resulting power failure made the two Wemo mini smart plugs completely unresponsive. I had to manually reset them and delete and reinstall the app to get them going again. So, I couldn't recommend them for remote locations where you can't perform any maintenance in the event of a power failure.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Hardware is great, the app needs some work.",4.0 ,"The new small form-factor of this unit is great, as it doesn't hog both the sockets on the outlet. You can fit two next to each other easily. It looks much slicker too. The only down-side is the WeMo app as it doesn't allow you to group switches together to turn them all on or off at once - almost all of my switches are for lighting in cabinets, on desks, and in displays, and I'd like to shut them all off with once tap without having to resort to ITTT or Alexa.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

The App is very reliable and the ability to set on and off timers is fantastic.

But no where on the device does it say the maximum wattage rating. This was very misleading. Support says sorry we can't help you because the power consumption exceeds the maximum on the device.

This is a step in the right direction but not what I'm wanting. Other then that it works great.

WEneedMO Smart Plugs,5.0 ,"I have had the WeMo Mini for 4 days now. Initially upon ordering the product, I had some delivery issue, but Amazon handled the issue promptly and without repercussion on my part. I have paired the WeMo with my Echo Dot. Here are my thoughts thus far on this product: 1) Easy set-up 2) Pairing with Dot was easy 3) My father has a smart plug, but his is a bit bulkier. I like the slender design of the WeMo Mini. 4) So far, the Mini is very responsive to remote instructions (manually via phone) 5) The Echo Dot will misunderstand on occassion, but the Mini responds immediately with Dot understands my voice. With that being said, I do have one negative review, but this does not reflect the Mini itself: 1) Although the set-up was easy, I also had the prior experience with setting up my father's smart plug. Belkin took a minimalist approach to their instructional packet and do not provide specifics. To an individual who has no prior experience to a plug like this, they may have trouble during set-up. I will update after further use.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great Device, Easy Controls, Good intro to smart-home tech.",4.0 ,"I ordered this originally to experiment with ""smart-home"" functionality in my apartment and have been using it a few days now. Set up is very simple with the WEMO app as well as device controls. I like to use the schedule function along with my alarm to help wake me up by turning on my lights in the morning . I currently use this to control my bedroom lamp however, the outlet is connected to a standard light switch which means if I turn off my lights with the physical switch without using the app then the WEMO will not have power. (small oversight on my part) I have to commit to using the app to turn off my lights. If you are thinking of getting this device to control lights already connected to a light switch, I think a more convenient device would be the WeMo Light Switch, Wi-Fi enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa Which replaces your standard light switch and allows you to manually use the light switch or control from the app.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

my thoughts on belkin light switches,4.0 ,"I love,love,love my belkin light switch, Let me start off by saying I use the app way more I use the light switch. I have 2, one for my porch light and one for my dining room I plan on buying more . I find my self away from the house forgetting to turn on my light switch I grab my phone and simply turn on my switch and if I'm away from the house long periods of time and it gets light out I simply turn off the porch light by my cell phone. I was going to just give 3 star's due to the fact this device can not be hooked up on lights controlled by two switches and the price being a bit high. But all in all I love this device (note to belkin) you should make true wall plugs. and make switches able to control lights on duel switches and lower your prices a bit) I almost did not buy due to the million company's out here with the same features at lower prices. But this is a must have for porches, basements, garages, up stairs and room lighting I'm not sure if the auto light function really works for dust to dawn lights did not work for me but other than that great product.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Smart home - here I come...,5.0 ,"The plug itself was pretty easy to set up. I did have to go through the procedure twice, but that's all of three steps so no biggie. The results are great. This is my first foray into smart home territory and I think I'm hooked. I'll probably end up getting a bunch of these and controlling them all (mostly) through Alexa. The Wemo app is useful if Alexa somehow messes up (as it did in my case, somehow thinking I had multiple devices connected even though I very clearly had only one in the app).","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Oh Alexa...,5.0 ,"I don't need to climb the stairs to the attic anymore, I'll let Alexa go up the stairs! Alexa, turn on the attic fan. Setup was a cinch since I already have another Wemo plug. If you are installing the smart plug in an awkward spot (isn't that why you bought it), have the instructions and your cellphone (app already installed) with you so you can complete the setup and confirm that things will turn on and off. I was able to confirm that everything works perfectly before I went back downstairs.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Perfect control for outside lighting.,4.0 ,"I learned of this product from my brother-in-law who has two of these units controlling his outside lights. I purchased one for myself to control my outside lights and it has been working great. The installation was a little tricky trying to get this switch into a tight fitting electrical box, but was able to do some trimming and get it to fit next to two other light switches. Setup was easy and after a little tweaking with the IOS app, the setup was complete and I am satisfied. Not sure what happens when you lose wifi signal to this unit, but I guess I will find out when that happens. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews about this product, but I am very satisfied with how it works and the ease of setup.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Awesome product!,5.0 ,"I bought one of these to try on Prime day and I LOVED it. I have a plug in lamp that hangs from the ceiling in the corner behind my couch. It was very hard to get to the switch to turn it on and off, but it looks great and I needed the light there. I used the Wemo plug and integrated it with Alexa - awesome! Not to mention my 5 year old loves talking to Alexa and having her turn the light on and off. I actually ended up buying two more that were delivered today. I'm also going to use them when I am not home at night to turn lights on and off, just to make it look like someone is home even if they aren't. My only complaint is that the directions were not very clear for the setup. It tells you top open settings, but it wants you to open your phone settings, not the app settings. One I Googled and figured it out, it was very simple.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Not Dependable Enough to Keep - Replaced with Different Tech,2.0 ,"Installation was fairly easy - if you understand basic electrical work. However, did not sync well with Belkin's Wemo app. Attempted to do factory reset (which I had to discover online) 3 times, but it didn't take. Purchased and installed Samsung SmartThings hub, thinking that would help. Suddenly, Wemo app discovered it and I could even sync with the Amazon Echo. Worked wonderfully for 18 hours, then neither the Wemo app, nor the Samsung hub, nor the Echo could detect it. Uninstalled it, replaced it with a GE 12727 Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Smart Toggle Switch, White . Flawless and detected immediately by their apps. Now, I can control lights with the SmartThings app and the Echo. Problem solved. I have moved on from Wemo, but your mileage may vary.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Awesome Device for someone wanting to automate lights.,5.0 ,Love this light switch! Was pretty easy to set up. Took me about 20-25 minutes but I've never wired anything before so I took my time. Programming this device took about 30 seconds and I was up and running. I had previous Wemo products so all I had to do was add it to my current profile. This switch now controls my outdoor lights at my house. I have it programmed to turn on 15 minutes before sunset and run for 4 hours before turning itself off. This device connects to your home wifi and checks to see what time the sunsets every day. This is such an awesome product for the money! I would recommend it to everyone!,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works Great,5.0 ,"I purchased and installed this for a family member and it is working great! This was a perfect solution for the back porch where we could turn on the light prior to getting in and out of the car so that our path to the door would be lit. Also, the installation was extremely simple. I especially liked the fact that I did not have to know which wire was the load wire or line wire as I could hook up either wire to either one of the black wires on the light switch. I know some other ""smart"" switches require you to differentiate them in order for the switch to work correctly and that can be a bit of a hassle if you don't have the right tools and a mess of wires behind the wall plate. I also did not have an issue with the firmware update or renaming the device like some others here so I at this point I would definitely recommend this product.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Good Stuff,5.0 ,"Decided to go with the Wemo switch because there is a real lack of options in the smart home market. This switch has treated me right so far and I have no complaints. The install was easy (took about 20 minutes, make sure you have a flashlight) and I can now control this with my Echo Dot which is awesome. You can control through your phone, echo, or just push the switch button.. Good Product","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wow!,5.0 ,Wow! They made this even better! I can't believe it! I love it. We actually have 14 WeMo devices. We have the plugs and the switches. This new switch was just so easy to set up. I did it in about 4 minutes and I'm in my mid 60's. Between using my phone to turn lights on and off when away and getting the heater in my office warming it up while I'm still in the shower at home and using my Echo to turn the lights off at night from my warm cozy bed I don't know how I ever did without them!,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Awesome idea, awful app",3.0 ,"Initial setup is PAINFUL. A smartphone is required for initial setup, but that is somewhat expected. The switch will create its own WiFi network that you connect to with an SSID with something like ""WeMo"" in it so it isn't hard to find. A note that Android Marshmallow (6 months old at time of writing this) is ""supported"" but doesn't work. Each time I tried to open the WeMo app on my phone (Stock Android Marshmallow Nexus 5x, no root) and connect to the device, it would fail and tell me to restart the app. After doing so, and getting the same error, I restarted my phone and tried again. Same problem. I ended up having to pull out one of my older phones from the junk drawer (Android Jellybean CyanogenMod Galaxy Nexus, rooted), charge it up, install the app and then attempt to connect. Luckily this worked, but it seems like the average person may not have the ability to ""grab another phone"" just to get this working. After connecting to the device and then giving it the settings to connect to my home network, I was able to connect with my original Nexus 5x running Marshmallow and everything has been fine since. The UI for the app is awful and not intuitive. Setting up rules seems odd since you don't do it by clicking on the device and then telling it when to turn off and on, but rather click ""Rules"" in the bottom right corner, create a rule and then associate the rule with the device. As a developer of web applications, this seems like a major flaw in the design. The app can seem a little slow at startup even on new devices. From the time I hit the icon to the time it is fully loaded take about 9 seconds. Once the initial setup was complete, this switch has been great. I have used it for the very basic use of turning on my porch light at sunset and off at dawn. Nothing fancy. It does that beautifully and I can even toggle the lights via the Internet (on my Nexus 5x) with a minimal delay. When connected to my home network, it is nearly instantaneous taking less than a second. When I am not at home, or on LTE, it takes anywhere from 2 seconds to 10 seconds to trigger. Since I don't normally use the app to turn on my porch lights during the day, this doesn't bother me in the slightest, but I can see how this might bother some people. I will note that the switch ""clicks"" audibly when turning on and off either by pressing the button, via the app, and via rules. It's loud enough to hear, but not obtrusive. CONCLUSION I would recommend this light switch to people who are a bit more tech savvy or at least willing to fumble around in the WeMo app for a while before getting this switch to work. Setup is a nightmare and seems to have some issues fundamentally with the Android app (iOS not tested). Once you get past that, this is a great product that I'm really glad I have. I have had this installed in two places (we moved) and has worked for now for about 10 months. PROS: + Set it and forget it design + Very pretty + Comes with no-screw faceplate but only if it is the only switch. + Sunset/Sunrise rules for turning off and on + Accessible via Internet through mobile app CONS: - Setup is painful at best - App is somewhat slow - Setting up rules in app is not intuative","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
this light switch worked great. I could turn it on and off remotely,2.0 ,"For a few months, this light switch worked great. I could turn it on and off remotely, it was tied to IFTTT events as well as sunrise / sunset. The most recent firmware update and/or app update has completely bricked the light switch. I've followed the factory reset guidelines over and over and over, trying to precisely nail 1 second for the restart and 5 seconds for reset, using a flat head screwdriver so that nothing else happens to get pressed inadvertently. No dice. Yes, it still turns on and off the lights, but I could get a switch for $2 that does that. I'd happily return this for one that may work, but at this point, I've lost a tremendous amount of faith in WeMo, Belkin and their products. Great idea, absolutely miserable implementation. Would have given this one star, but when it worked, it was fantastic. Now, that it seems to be fully bricked, after less than 9 months of use, I'm livid. Who do I send this dead switch to so that they can replace it with one that actually works as expected?","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo Mini:Great beginner-level device for home automation,5.0 ,"Ordered two Wemo Minis to control two classic mushroom lamps in the bedroom. Setup was a breeze even though this location was the farthest from my old router. I set it up to and linked it to my Google Home bedroom speaker so I can turn on and off either light independently of the other, or turn them both on and off together. I am really pleased with how well this arrangement works using only my voice to operate the lamps. Have recently transitioned to a mesh network with Google WiFi and the smart plugs are operating well on the mesh network. Looking forward to expanding my home network with more Wemo devices.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Good in theory but software is clunky,3.0 ,I got this to help us turn the fan on the dresser on or off in the middle of the night. It worked great once I stumbled through the clunky setup. The software isn't the best. Unfortunately it was such a pain in the butt to install/reinstall after I changed wifi set up at home that I wanted to throw it out the window. Even following the directions exactly. You can't just copy and paste the info for your wifi into it. Then I made the mistake of updating the firmware. It never could get it downloaded all the way and then it no longer worked after that. I tried to do the setup again to no avail. I gave up and ordered a different plug. I'm very tech/app savvy and this shouldn't be that difficult to do.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"One WEMO Is Not Enough - They are Too Convenient, Cost-Effective, and Easy-to-Use",5.0 ,"Within a week of buying my first WEMO Switch on Amazon, I went to local retailer and bought two more. What's not to love about the ease of setup, convenience of use and affordability? If you can plug it in you can control it from your smart phone. I've created multiple schedules for one switch - am, pm, weekdays and weekends - so that a table lamp goes on and off when I desire. Try setting that up on a traditional timmer with the one-inch screen and multiple menus! I've already recommended WEMO switches to family and friends and plan to give them as birthday gifts or stocking stuffers. Imagine controlling a Christmas tree or lights come the holiday season. My next project is to control my tv components and DVR, powering them off when not in use or recording in order to cut down on phantom power use. I suspect the savings from that one plug alone may quickly cover the cost of the swiches I've purchased thus far. You owe it to yourself to try a WEMO on Amazon. But fair warning, one is not enough!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"but is invaluable in an application like mine, where the dimmer switch is out of ...",4.0 ,"Setup was incredibly simple if you're competent with basic electrical wiring. This is a very expensive switch, but is invaluable in an application like mine, where the dimmer switch is out of the way. My wife and I went months in between making use of a pair of light above our kitchen peninsula because the switch was in an awkward location. Setting this up on a schedule along with a night mode made the lights feel like a new addition to our kitchen. Throwing in the voice command skills on the Alexa app made it even better. The only knock I have on this is that it does not support 3-way switches. Obviously that is a technical complication, but it is one that you would expect Belkin to have addressed on an $80 light switch.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

Very flaky,3.0 ,"Bought 3 of these from Amazon 3 months ago. First thing I don't like is no web browser app for them so can't get to them via my PC. Second is the software is very flaky. When I first got these the ""away mode"" rule (tells them to turn on and off intermittently during a period of time) worked fine as well as the ability to enable/disable rules. After a few weeks, and a software upgrade to the app the ""away mode'' would not work when I turned it on for a switch and I could no longer get the rules to enable/disable as they should. In the past couple of weeks I tried the ""away mode"" again and it worked. Just tried disabling a couple of rules and the first one I tried disabled ok, all other attempts after that did not work. Checked their ""community"" web site and lots of these kinds of problems posted. If you're not doing any rules based stuff (having them turn on and off at certain times or doing the away mode thing) they may not be too bad, but the rules was a big part of why I bought them.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
In love with these switches,5.0 ,"I have 0 background in electrical work and I did this in <10min Shut off power to outlet. Unhook old switch, Hook wemo wires to existing wires with wire caps. Screw back in. Open app and use! This switch works great. The app is user friendly. This switch will not work on a light that is controlled by two switches that are in separate locations (Like the hall light controlled by a switch at opposite ends of the hall) The switch does work with my ceiling fan light in my great room and bedroom. Mixed in with the Tasker app, I have it set so when I hit the GPC coordinates at the end of my driveway, Tasker turns on my garage light, living room and hall light.

Works Well,5.0 ,"I was somewhat concerned when I read feedback from several people that said they had problems using this product with Apple's airplay as we use airplay quite extensively. I have not encountered any negative issues with airplay and all three switches work beautifully. The setup instructions were superior and included a useful installation video. I like the fact that an additional hub was not required to make these work. We use a Linksys EA6500 dual band router and airplay mostly using the 5g, and our cable modem speeds are 15-30 mbs download and 1.5-3.0 mbs upload. Additionally, I was concerned that the switches might interfere with my Skybell doorbell also on 2.4g (also no issues noted). I have owned these switches for about two weeks and have not encountered any problems whatsoever.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great remote WiFi device for lights, fans, etc.",5.0 ,I ordered 1 of these to start looking at options to replace my existing Xfinity Home service - house alarm and remote lights - which is costing me over $60 a month.

This is an amazing device. Now I can say,5.0 ,"This is an amazing device. Now I can say, ""Wemo ON"" or ""Wemo OFF"" and it turns on or off whatever I have plugged into the device. Better yet, I can also turn it on or off remotely, as long as I can connect to the internet or get a cell phone signal. Doesn't get any better than this and the Wemo was super easy to set up as long as you are connected to the same network as the Wemo. Oh, yes, I should mention that Belkin, the company that makes Wemo has fantastic support.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Awesome light switch,5.0 ,"Awesome product. I purchased one of these to put on my front porch lights. I wanted a switch that would run on a standard dusk to dawn setting while also being wifi controllable. This switch is perfect. It works flawlessly, looks good, was super easy to install, and is programmable with the click of a button. I was able to swap out my existing standard light switch to this in approximately 7 minutes including the time connecting it to my home network. I have since purchased 4 more to be able to control every exterior light in my house. My house was built in 1966 and has the *required* white wire needed for the wifi power draw. It is important that you have this wire as the product will not work without it. Some older homes do not have this extra wire so make sure your home has this before you buy.

"Easy setup, great Wifi response",4.0 ,I purchased the WeMo Light Switch because it is a Belkin product and I've had good experiences previously. I was happy to find that the packaging doubled as installation instructions. I was able to follow the instructions and install my light switch in about 10 minutes - after I shut down and verified no power to the switch (which is also explained in the instructions). I have been able to use it with my WeMo app and Alexa. The switch responds well to both. The only problem I had was with the switch plate cover. There were two little tabs around the opening that prevented it from setting on the switch properly. I cut them off with scissors and it snapped right into place.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

It worked for about two weeks and then it just stopped working even though I try to sync it on my phone and Alexa are again it does not work. It might not be the WeMo it might be me since I am Technology challenged. But I read the instructions carefully, I did exactly what they said. I am not a stupid person and it still doesn't work, so it is sitting in the box . Also, the instructions aren't easy to follow.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great product!!,5.0 ,"We LOVE it! We installed it without any issues. It does have more wires in the back than a standard switch, so it was a little harder to squeeze the wires into the switch box behind the switch plate. Otherwise, it is great! One review I read said that they loved theirs until their power went out one day and they never got it to work again. Our power has gone out in a few wind storms this winter and it has started working on its own every time after the power comes back on. It takes a few minutes for our cable modem to reset, then the wireless router to reset and finally the light switch to reconnect. But, then it is back to normal. We have it set to turn our outside lights on at dusk and off at sunrise. It automatically adjusts these times based on the time of year. My husband and I can change or override these settings at anytime from anywhere from the app on our phone. You can run many WeMo devices from the same app. A feature we will take advantage of in the future.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
WeMo Smart Plug,4.0 ,"The WeMo is a great way to intelligently turn devices on and off. The free app makes it easier than ever to set up appliances in your home and control them with the click of a button. WeMo devices also pair with Amazon Alexa, Nest and other smart home devices. One downfall is that I have a lot of old 2 prong plugs in my house and the WeMo Smart Plug is a 3 prong and needs to have a connector on it. This makes it stick out a bit from the wall, but not the end of the world. I plan on upgrading the plug to 3 prong soon. I also really like the away feature you can set to turn the lamp on and off at random times during travel to make it appear someone is in the home. I purchased one to test out controlling a lamp on the first floor of my home, and I am liking the results so far. I will definitely be purchasing more WeMo items for my house.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
A good buy if not bought near retail,4.0 ,"I got this on a deal day & for the lower price it was well worth it. The instructions are clear, and the only difficult part of the install was the wire caps were too small. So, I had to go back to my older large wire caps. (The copper wiring where I installed it was thicker solid core wire thus the size issue.) The configuration is pretty straight forward, but might throw non-technically savvy people for a bit of a loop. I can only fault people that do not often learn things for that though, since anyone with a basic understanding of wireless networking should have no problem. The app works pretty well although I wish it loaded quicker on my iPhone 4. That is an old hardware limitation, so I am not going to fault it for that either. But even on the iPad 4 it takes about a second longer to load than I would like. after over a month, it only had one outage that was quickly fixed. I wouldn’t buy another for full retail price, but I would for half the price. If they made a model that could dim this would be a 5 star product.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

"Works great, but does dim really low like old manual switch",5.0 ,"I am a long time wemo product user and have been waiting forever for this dimmer switch. I had no trouble installing it and connecting to wifi and also getting it to show up in Amazon Alexa app. The only issue (minor) that I have is that my LED bulbs won't dim as low as the old manual Lutron dimmer used to do. The lowest setting on Wemo dimmer (even after manual calibration) is brighter than the lowest possible via Lutron dimmer.

Switching to Wemo,5.0 ,"I purchased this due to it being the only hubless wifi dimmer switch that I could find on the market. I had already started populating my house with TP-link smart switches due other reviews I have seen stating that the TP-link switches tended to be less glitchy and more robust in operation. After a few days using the new Wemo dimmer, I am very pleased. It is pleasing to the eye and set up was a breeze. There was a brief learning curve when it came to utilizing the touch sensitive dimmer slider thing but it works well once you figure out how to touch it. I am also happy with the seamless functionality with my Google assistant. What really sets this apart are the Wemo features. Being able to program a long press function that will command other Wemo devices in the house is a feature I was left searching for with my TP-link hardware. The only area where it falls behind the TP-link switches is in response time using Google assistant. When I say ""Turn on all of the lights"" the TP-link switches will fire first every time. Along with this, the Wemo app takes a bit longer to boot up than I'd like but the added functionality over the other switches makes up for this. Pending any horrible recurring errors with this switch I will definitely be purchasing more Wemo products.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The smart plug works flawlessly (so far) after many hours of ...,3.0 ,"The smart plug works flawlessly (so far) after many hours of trial and error (and entering my email address over and over). Written installation instructions were sparse/minimal, while troubleshooting instructions consisted mainly of ""unplug"", ""reset"",""reinstall"", leaving me feeling as though I were in some endless do-over. Description/meaning of the lights was very good and helpful. If you want to improve your ""Quik"" Start Guide, enlist some poor soul who knows nothing about your smart plug but moderately knowledgeable about phones, tablets, apps, etc. and follow him through set-up and installation.

Finally a wifi-enabled smart home is possible and important details about using this with wifi repeaters,5.0 ,"It's been a long road to a wifi-enabled smart home. I bought this light switch just to see if it works as advertised. It does! It is not difficult to install but I would not recommend a home-owner install it unless they have some prior experience replacing outlets and and/or light switches. The provided instructions were clear and concise so it is possible for a non-handyman / non-electrician to install but make sure you know what you are doing with electricity before you touch any wires. If you are not certain, use a volt-meter. If I already lost you, get a handyman or electrician. The product works great and the ability to schedule on/off times is working beautifully. What's even better is the device can be configured for your time zone. This this means you can set sunset/sunrise and even off-sets from sunset and sunrise (+ 15 mins, etc.). This is a very well thought out scheduler software. Update: My house loses power regularly and the switch always stayed configured and connected to my wifi. One day I added to wifi repeater to my home using the same SSID as my wifi-router. My house lost power again and this time my light-switch lost connectivity to my wifi. The switch is within reach of both my wifi-router and my wifi-repeater and appears to have gotten confused about which one to connect to. I had to factory reset the switch and reconfigure the switch from step 1. Still I could not get the switch configured for my wifi. Configuration kept failing. I decided to unplug the wifi-repeater and I was able to complete the configuration of the switch. Once complete I plugged-in the wifi-repeater and the switch is working fine and staying connected to my wifi.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
WiFi issues with Android app,2.0 ,"Wouldn't connect to my WiFi network. Specifically, my network does not broadcast the SSID, and the Android app on my Galaxy S6 only allows me to select non-hidden networks. The customer service rep, after asking me some fairly-irrelevant questions about my ISP and otherwise, said it should work. Felt like I was repeating myself more than was comfortable so I gave up. Will keep the plug for a while just in case the app updates to something that works as desired, but I can't honestly say I'm thrilled. My other smart home devices haven't had issues with my network config so perhaps I've gotten spoiled.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Switches are great,5.0 ,"Live the wemo light switches. I have several I use for window candles and outside decorations. They are pre-set to come on at sunset and off at sunrise. Couple this switch with LED lights and you can just “set it and forget it”... If you don’t have a neutral wire you are not supposed to install this product. My house didn’t have a neutral on this specific switch (actually wired with reverse neutral, according to an electrician I talked with), however, you can wire it without but there is always a risk. I used the Wemo forums to get “alternative” wiring and have been using for several months without issue.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
My other disappointment is that I must use a smartphone app to ...,3.0 ,"I bought this to work work off time and location (IFTTT). The time works well (on and off at certain times), but not so well with location. I have set location in IFTTT as zip and then as town, but it's too slow. Typically it turns on the wemo as I enter the door. I want the switch to come on when I enter the zip or town. My other disappointment is that I must use a smartphone app to connect my wemo to wifi, rather than my chromebook, which would be more efficient.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Level needed intermediate to expert,4.0 ,so ill start by saying that im versed in electronics and wiring. but i found this to be just one step harder than i thought. the instructions and videos to install this are right on the money. i ordered 3 of these and the first 2 took me less than 45 minutes to install. taking pictures of the wiring. installing and saftey check were easy. setting up the network were just a little harder. i found that the app is 90% of the issue with the setting up for wifi use. i found the app doesnt respond really well when setting up more than one device. when installing my 3rd one i found that the wiring in my house was a little messed up. the switch controlled or crossed linked power with 3 different things. so this is where the expert comes into play. ok thats the bad. ok the good. THEY WORK they work awesome. they turn on an off in under a second of being controlled with my phone. having lights turn on and off when i am not here is awsome. they turn on and off when i say. when i am not in the network it takes upto 2 seconds to turn on or off. the app shows up when i turn it on manually in no time at all. note - if you dont know what your doing or your just learning. find someone who is trained. and dont be in a rush. when its set up. its setup you will be more than happy. if your not good with wireless networks ask a friend who is. and please dont think it doesnt work right away when the power goes out. give it 2 or 3 minutes to power up and get restarted. it takes a minute for its system to come online. and above all its pretty awsome. 4 out of 5 awsome,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great Smart Switch - Read the box carefully.,5.0 ,"As advertised. Great smart switch. Note not for three way switching. I don't believe this will work for lights that have more than one switch. Wemo is working on this, but has not released it yet. Also not for dimming, but if you want to do cool things like control your lighting schedule via Alexa, this is for you. Scheduling functions work perfectly and are really flexible. App and set up is intuitive. Great design. Does not introduce the need for extra gear. Once diming and three way come out, all the switches are getting replaced.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I like it!,4.0 ,"Received this yesterday (2 day shipping thanks to Prime). The switch is for 4 outside lights controlled by 1 switch. Very easy to install, setup was a little tricky but I like a challenge and had the Android app connected and communicating with the light switch in 15 minutes. I was able to toggle the lights on and off successfully. Within five minutes, the app noted that there was a firmware upgrade available. I chose to upgrade and it took about ten minutes. After the update, I was able to communicate with the light switch again and test the switch. Since I don't wish to have the lights to come on automatically everyday, I will be turning them on manually with the switch and will let the program turn them off at sunrise with the app. The setup determined daily sunrise time by my location. I tested it this morning and the program worked perfectly; it turned the lights off at 7:20 AM. Although Belkin states that metal wall plates should not be used and can decrease the WiFi signal to the switch, I reinstalled my brass wall plate and my signal is adequate. This is probably because the switch is relatively close to the WiFi router. Unlike some others who had problems, I did not, and one day after the installation, I am 100% satisfied. I rated 4 stars out of 5 only because my review of the switch is less than 24 hours after the installation. I will update my rating in a month or so.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Even better than the original.,5.0 ,"I loved their original Wemo smart plug and this one is even better. It is significantly smaller than the original - especially in that it no longer blocks the second outlet in a standard wall plug. Wemo is one of the few smart ""things"" that I have found that does not require a hub to connect with Alexa. So, instead of spending $50-$100 on a (useless) hub, I can spend that money on more Wemo devices that actually do something. Come over to the Wemo side!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great switch! Wifi network makes all the difference,4.0 ,"I've had this switch installed for a little over a year. I use it to turn on my outside lights. It programs easily and I love having the ability to turn on and off remotely, as well as set a recurring timer to go on and off after dusk. Only challenge I've experienced is the Wifi connection in my network sometimes drops--but that's because I now have a dozen devices on my router...time to upgrade the home network! I wish the switch was easier to change wifi settings, perhaps just a setting in-app, but it may be more difficult by design to keep it secure from being hijacked.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The epitome of Plug and Play,5.0 ,"Love these! Easy to setup and use. Does require a little bit of WiFi and tech understanding, generally speaking if your having a problem with setup check your router or your setup device(smartphone) but once these are setup on a good network, you can unplug and move them around with no problems. You can make just about anything a smart device that you can control from your phone or Alexa, program is limited to your imagination!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Performs beautifully with IFTTT routines!,5.0 ,"My husband recently received an Echo Dot for his birthday, and we've been slowly but surely integrating our ""smart home"" features into it. One of the things that this entailed was simplifying the bedtime routine - turn off all AV equipment and central home lights, turn AC to night time program and turn on the bedroom fan. This switch assisted with the bedroom fan - integrated the switch into IFTTT and everything works just as it should.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great way to set timers on lights,3.0 ,"Using this product my plant lights turn themselves on and off automatically according to my instructions and my whim. I just wish it sat more snugly and securely in the outlet. It seems liable to get wobbled free. Although it hasn't yet in the few weeks I have had it installed. Edit: Although the set up was difficult with the first plug, I thought it would be easier with any new plugs. I was wrong. I have been trying unsuccessfully to install a second plug for an hour. The instructions are paltry, especially the troubleshooting section. I am dropping my review to three stars.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Affordable connected switch,4.0 ,"I live in a loft condo and the switch for the overhead lights is on the ground floor. It was very frustrating to constantly be running up & down stairs just to toggle the light. It took a few attempts to get the switch working, but so far it's worked great. The best think about Wemo is that it works with other 3rd party services like IFTTT (if this then that) and the app ""launch."" This allows you to create all kinds of rules around when the switch turns on/off based. I'm now planning to extend the system with some wemo Led bulbs and perhaps their outlets. My only complaint is that the Wemo app itself is a little slow and clunky.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo Mini Smart Plug not so mini compared to Wemo Switch ease of install and updates.,5.0 ,I had previously bought two of the Wemo light switches to put a schedule on my front porch and garage lights so they would turn on at dusk. I recently bought some decorative topary plants with light to sit on my porch as well and needed a way for them to turn on and off with the switches. The Wemo Mini Smart Plug was much easier to setup than the Wemo switches. I had issues with the firmware update in the switches but did not have any issues updating the Mini Smart Plug. Overall you can tell it is very well made and actually feels very sturdy when I plugged into it. I had it up and running in under 5 minutes. I would definitely recommend this as a quick wifi switch solution,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Light Switch with Motion Sensors,5.0 ,I decided on trying WEMO after having X10 and zWave devices in my past homes. I purchased all used Amazon Prime devices and everyone of them worked fine but had to reset two of them because they had the wrong code. I was impressed on how easy it was to setup. The only trick was figuring out the IFTTT that I used on my outside lights which come on at dusk and off at different times. I have the motion detector inside by the front door so if there is movement in that area all the master bathroom lights come on for one minute. If the bathroom lights are already on they are not effected and do not shut off after one minute. My goal is to purchase the WEMO Maker Kit when it comes available and connect it up to a wireless outdoor motion detector. When motion is triggered outside during the night my selected lights inside and outside will turn on. These non-WEMO remote motion sensors will connect up to one receiver with a relay contact. When motion is detected I will receive a text using SMS ITFFF like I do for my indoor motion detector.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Very Happy,5.0 ,"This works great. I decided to buy it despite the high price. I don’t think I would have done so if I wasn’t so impressed with the Wemo mini plugs I bought a few months ago. The dimmer works exactly as advertised, and like other reviews say, was easy to install and add to the Wemo app and Alexa. I actually rarely physically push on it - I usually use Alexa. My wife does not always like my smart home experiments but this one she likes a lot and actually uses.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Can't reconnect them the 3rd time. Not worth the hassle.,5.0 ,"This is a big convenience. I use the switch with my Amazon Echo and can now turn on the light from the other end of the room just by talking. There was no switch on that side of the living room, so now I don't need one. This is what I wrote a while ago. The first time I easily installed the switches. Then there was an automatic upgrade, and I had to re-connect the switches to Wi-Fi and had trouble doing it. After a third update, they disconnected again and I can't connect them at all, whatever I do. I'm tired of this and will reinstall a regular switch and find another way to turn on a remote lamp. These are not well designed, but may improve in the future. I don't even know who I would call to connect these for me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Belkin WeMo Light Switch,5.0 ,"I have installed three of these switches and think they work great. I found install to be extremely easy. I have not had any problems connecting to the switches. The Belkin App might not be the greatest, but I have not had any issues with it either. They have been updating it recently so hopefully it gets better. The switch has a small white light when it is off and green light when it is on. Both are nice. I have two installed outside covered with an outdoor switch cover. No problems there. I have one installed inside and the switch cover isn't able to be screwed all the way down because of the thickness of the switch lip. Not a big deal, but if they thinned out the top and bottom lip a little it would fit better.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Operate switches from any where!!,5.0 ,Purchased a mini as a test for adding smart plugs to house. I was absolutely impressed that the setup was so easy. Echo has no problem working with Wemo. I especially like the wemo App and I can now operate my lights or appliances from anywhere in the world that has wifi or cellular connection. Scheduling is easy and intuitive on the App. I was so impressed I bought 3 more minis to operate my lamps throughout my house. Great product.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Love it. Also very easy to turn on/off from ...,5.0 ,"Installation was simple, instructions were well written, iPhone APP installed flawlessly and was east to configure - joined WiFi first try. Using auto on setting in sync with daily sunset and auto off at 11. Love it. Also very easy to turn on/off from app but not something I use much since it's now on a timer. Also, when the switch loses connectivity with wireless (my Wifi seems to lose connectivity at least once per week - unrelated to the switch), the switch power light will blink informing you that it is disconnected from WiFi. All in all...great experience.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Solid product with room for improvement,4.0 ,"I currently own ten of these switches and overall I found them to be very useful. Things I like about them ======================================= No hub required. -note to this. If the wifi network at your house does not reach well you may be better served with a switch that uses a different protocol like zwave or zigbee Echo Integration Room for improvement ======================================= I have found that if they get disconnected from the router (for example, power goes out), if they reconnect and are assigned a different IP address then Echo has a difficult time controlling them for a while. I resolved this by giving all of my IoT devices reserved IP addresses on my local network. This is a little tedious, but has bee helpful for me. Dimmer. They really should make a product that supports dimming. This isn't a huge issue for me, I haven't replaced any of my dimmable switches (which are mostly for fans in my home). But, it would be nice to have the option.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
EZ Setup - Works Great With All My Other Wemo Things,5.0 ,"This is my third Wemo, but my first Mini Smart Plug. I got this one to use in place of the Wemo Switch hoping that it would not block the outlet below. It is much better than earlier models in that respect. I was hoping to use a wall mount surge protector in the outlet below my Wemo Mini, but the surge protector was too bulky. Currently I use it to turn on a small 750 watt bathroom heater an hour before my alarm goes off in the morning.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
More quality WeMo switches,4.0 ,"The dimmer is actually better looking than the standard Wemo light switches which is a definite plus for me. The installation was quick and easy at the wall as I was replacing a dimmer I had already put in, so there was plenty of room. Setup wasn't perfect, while the dimmer showed up quickly as a wifi connection, it took a couple of full resets, reboots, and putting the phone an inch away from the dimmer to get it to connect to my network correctly (for reference I did a regular lightswitch on the same circuit at the same time and it went first try). After that though it works well, it supports the incandescent bulbs I have yet to replace, the Echo is decent (could be better with levels of brightness vs percentage, wife was telling it 2 and it decided she meant 2 percent brightness), and it was relatively on sale.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Once everything was set up the Wemo mini smart plug works perfectly,3.0 ,"The product works as advertised. That being said, Wemo is historically buggy and finicky... I had to do mild research to see how to do a factory restart on this product (as well as an older version of this plug) in order to get the wifi to show on my phone. Once that was done, I had to restart my router so it could recognize the Wemo. Once everything was set up the Wemo mini smart plug works perfectly.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works well,4.0 ,"To be fair, I don't use the Wemo app to manage my wemo devices other than to initialize them. Once that's done, I use WemoManager from the Google Play Store. The device itself works well and is responsive and when paired with the WemoManager app it is a reliable smart switch.. I have not had any issues with it so far. I have many other Wemo devices in my IOT home and they've all played well so far. I have programmed them on a schedule and also use home screen widgets to quickly control the various devices. In the case of this mini smart plug, on or off.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great product.,5.0 ,"I bought two of these and replace two old-style timer switches in my home. The old ones would loose their programming every time we lost power, which seemed to happen right after I reprogrammed them! These, I can program from my phone so if we do lose power it will be easy. We haven't lost power yet so I can't tell if they will lose their programming. The definitely look a lot better and so far work flawlessly. The android app could use a bit of work. It is awkward when you add a new device to your network. The app finds the device easily enough, but you'll end up killing and restarting the app several times in the process. Any problems I've had have always been the app, not the device. I will likely buy more.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
This is the smart outlet that you've been looking for.,5.0 ,Works like a charm. I have 4 smart plugs controlling lights all around the house. They are a breeze to set up and stay connected to wifi consistently (more so than my 6 LiFX bulbs). Alexa integration is a breeze and react very quickly.

Amazing switch. A little glitchy getting it set up ...,5.0 ,"Amazing switch. A little glitchy getting it set up and the four wires (two hot, a ground and a neutral) threw me for a loop as BOTH of the switches I have replaced with these Wemo devices did not have the line for a neutral. I have an electrician friend who helped me and thought it was not big deal to just wire the neutral to the ground wire and away we went. It worked, but I wish Wemo would anticipate installations in houses built more than 5 years ago and the possibility of a missing neutral. The setup glitch just required restarting the phone and at one point deleting and reinstalling the app. But eventually I got it working. I now have three switches running at two different addresses.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works Well With Alexa... Video Included!,5.0 ,"On my nightstand is a lamp that has the switch inline with the electrical cord, so it hangs halfway down to the floor. Usually at night I will read until my eyes are heavy and then try to sleep making the task of turning off the light more stressful than usual. This inspired me to buy my first 'smart switch' :) The WEMO Smart Plug works well via either Alexa or my Iphone, and setup was not overly difficult. I have included a video of the WEMO in action with Alexa :)","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Not fun to set up. Will absolutely require several internet searches.,4.0 ,"Dimmer works great. Setup is touchy - several things must be disabled via android and 5ghz cannot be used during setup, which were only discovered through slow crawls of forums. Several times during setup the app stalled out, resulting in starting from scratch. Took 2.5 hours to work through these kinks, but once up and running everything is flawless, including Alexa. Alexa support for ""fade out"" would be nice.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Excellent dimmer with 'enough' smart features.,5.0 ,"I purchased 3 of these dimmers to go with a few existing Wemo switches and plugs I already had. They installed easily having enough prior electrical knowledge to change out switches and outlets. You do need a neutral(white) wire as stated. The switch does come with connected wires so you won't need to add a jumper. I did have some issues connecting the first one to my wifi. It could just be yet another bug in IOS11 and I saw a few people out there having the same problem. I had to delete the app, restart my phone, then reinstall the app. Once I did that everything setup smoothly. Also once the first dimmer connected, the rest of them setup without a problem. It is really nice that you can set the dim range along with the type of lightbulbs. The app is really easy to use and you can set up rules/connect to Nest or IFTT or Alexa to make it even more convenient. The only thing I wish is that you could access from the web. Maybe a software update in the future? The dimmer itself works well and is quite responsive. Capacitive touch dimming is good but isn't perfect. No real complaints even so. Overall its a nice dimmer to compliment the other quality Wemo products.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
WeMo Light Switch - A Safety Device,5.0 ,This is indispensable for my home. I don't get that much light at the top of my stairs from the bottom light fixture provided at the foot of the stairs. I have a light fixture up at the top but the switch for it is inside my apartment. Using the bottom light switch and that light fixture cast just ok light but is not safe enough on a dark carpet. Being able to manually turn on my personal hall light from my phone when I reach within my Wi-Fi or put it on the timer is brilliant.

Cool and trouble free to date,5.0 ,"We have an Echo and an echo-dot. Took maybe five minutes to hook the first neat switch up, maybe three minutes for the second. Then say five minutes in the Alexa app to incorporate the two switches we added. Now from either Alexa we can turn either switch on/off or both at once (Alexa group). Cool and trouble free to date.

"Easy setup, easy to use, easy Amazon Echo Dot integration",4.0 ,"I've used X-10 products in the past but am trying out WiFI enabled plugs. These are fairly compact and do allow use of the other outlet. They are pretty easy to setup via an iPhone, especially if you already have the Wemo app downloaded from a previous installation; otherwise there are just a couple of extra steps but nothing complicated. I've already downloaded firmware updates to my plugs, so Wemo must be making changes. I do wish these plugs had a way to support both manual and automatic operation of lights, from what I can tell they don't. That's one thing my X-10 modules support that is handy. I am using them with Amazon Echo Dots, so integration with those was critical to me.

Completely met expectations,5.0 ,"I have now had the WeMo light switch installed for about three months, it was quite easy to install and setup and has run flawlessly. I have it set to turn on around sunset and then turn off at a scheduled time. The app is easy to use. The main reason I purchased this light switch compared to others was that it connected to my wi-fi and did not need a proprietary router like some other systems. The only issue I have had which I see as more of a feature enhancement than a flaw is that if there is a power cut, although the switch reconnects to the wi-fi it does not check what its status should be, ie scheduled to be on or off. So I have returned home to find the lights out due to a brief power outage, ie power is back on but lights remained off when they should have been on.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Good product with extremely poor design,2.0 ,"Basically, I have been using 2 of the witches for several months now and here is my reality: 1.- Nice looking device. 2.- A really nice idea for a product; if it actually works as is supposed to. 3.- In order for the product to work, u have to constantly refresh it every time you open the application on your phone (specially if you leave, or get connected to your home wi-fi network, like for example: when you leave or come back to your home). 4.- It takes a decent amount of time for the refreshing process; which is indeed very annoying. 5.- The most recent firmware ""upgrade"" which was supposed to make things better did the complete opposite. Now I can not even use the switches once I leave the house. It gives you the ""Not detected"" signal for each switch. All of the above has been reported to Belkin's technical team. I have been waiting 4 days now for someone to actually know what is going on with their own product. Extremely sad experience, specially after paying so much money for a simple light switch. Belkin continues to disappoint!! RECOMMENDATION: Don't waste your money yet. Maybe some one can figure it out down the line.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Switches and smart plugs work perfectly,4.0 ,"The switches and smart plugs by WeMo work perfectly. If I unplug them or the power goes off they come back and reconnect to the WiFi automatically. If the wifi goes out and comes back they reconnect automatically. The reason for four stars is because the app is a little twitchy.

Great idea - so convenient!,4.0 ,"This switch is awesome!! The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because I can't set a schedule to have it turn on at a certain time and then off...there's one setting (away) where I can have it come on and then shut off at a desired time, but, it doesn't seem to come on at the time I have selected, so I don't know that it works right. Maybe a glitch in the programming? What I do know is that it's great to be able to turn the light on from anywhere! We used this for a porch light that the previous home owners wired and put the switch inside a cabinet in the garage...not exactly a convenient place for a light switch.

If you have a strong wifi, then these are fantastic. I'm upgrading my review from a 2 to a 4. By the way, I now have a total of seven (yes, 7) devices. All are working flawlessly with Alexa. I should probably give this 5 stars, but I'll err on the conservative side. I have three Wemo plugs (the vertical style) and liked them so well I decided to buy two of the mini smart plugs. Big mistake. While the Wemo app on my phone doesn't discriminate, the minis have a different wifi name than the larger Wemo plugs do. Echo has no trouble controlling my three original devices, but cannot find the two new smart plugs. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the smart plugs twice to no avail. Buyer beware: do not commingle devices if your plan for primary control is via Amazon echo.

I love having this Wemo switch,5.0 ,I love having this Wemo switch. It was easy to install and now I never have to come home to an empty house again. We have the Amazon Echo and Alexa was easy to sink up to the Wemo switch now I don't even have to get up to turn on the outside lights I just tell Alexa to do it. I will be recommending this product to my friends and family. We were even able to turn on the outside lights while we were out of town on vacation by simply clicking on the app on my phone to turn them on. My neighbor told me they knew were were out of town but saw that every day at around dusk the out side lights would blink on. They thought I had them on a timer...when they found out that I had the Wemo switch they ordered two for their house as well.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo Works Well!,5.0 ,"We're really enjoying how the Wemo mini works with our Echo to enable us to turn on and off the light from our bedroom just by asking Alexa to turn it off. It makes it much safer to be able to light up the room without fumbling around in the dark, but our real purpose in buying it was for the ability to access it by smartphone when we travel. This is far more than a timer, although you can set it to operate as one. The ability to change the schedule and switch it on or off remotely with the app allows us to give the appearance of an occupied home. Is has proven to be easy to set up, and simple to operate. We're thinking of other purposes to use it for all the time. Great product.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo review,4.0 ,I have had this plug for one week now. It has been working well. Set up may be difficult for non technology users. App interface could be simplified. I used x10 devices for years and the interface was much more user friendly and its set up was more complete. It would be nice to have options when setting on/off times to set security on/off so that the particular device would go on/off at different intervals. I am concerned that Belkin may be discontinuing this line as some prior products are no longer available. Would like motion sensors to set off other switches. Time will tell.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"If you have a smartphone, don't waste your money on a regular timer",5.0 ,"Replaced an old light timer with this unit and I couldn't be happier. No more lights turning off at 6pm and back on a 6am, the WeMo app lets you set up your own schedule. Want your lights to turn off on Mondays at 9pm, but stay on until 3am on the weekends? Go for it. It's customizable and lets you manage whatever schedule you desire. I plan to add another to run the low voltage lights since those are on a different power line. In addition to the schedule, you can manually turn it off and on by pressing the bottom of the button. A green light lets you know it's on.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Perfect for our Christmas tree lights!,5.0 ,SIMPLE setup...literally less than 5 minutes. I've owned previous versions and prefer this one because it doesn't block the other plug on the outlet. So far the routine has worked perfectly (turning on 15 minutes before sunset) and control from my phone has been seamless. I can also tell Alexa to turn the lights on or off without even needing to access the app on my phone. This is the 5th active WEMO product in our home and we have had good luck with all of them.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Alomost perfect, too bad...",3.0 ,For the most part is does what it is advertised to do. I am having a problem with Bose equipment that Wemo any plug type just can't seem to power up. I have talked to both Belkin and Bose support and each blames the other which means I am right in the middle with nothing getting done and the device not working. If any reading this knows how to fix this please let me know. The main unit I have problems with is a Bose Solo I sound bar.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
it was easy to pair up with my Echo Show and I ...,4.0 ,"Setting up the Wemo was challenging. The app is very well designed and guides you through the process, but for some reason, it had a hard time finding my home WiFi network. It would pick up the neighbors across the yard, but not my own signals. I had to go through the troubleshooting pages online, but eventually it worked. I'm not sure though why or what was different from my previous attempts. Once it was set up though, it was easy to pair up with my Echo Show and I have been using it everyday for the last week. So far no problems with the connections. The compact design (compared to other smart plugs) is great and I like that I can still control the power to devices with the hardware button. I'm not sure yet if I'll buy another one yet. I want more smart plugs, but I wasted a lot of time trying to get this one to work. At the moment, if the device continues to work over the next week or two, I'm inclined to buy another one and see if the process will be smoother.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
So helpful,5.0 ,I know this seems a bit silly but I love this!!! I've had 7 back surgeries and now have severe nerve damage in both legs because of it. In addition I also have severe pain in my left knee. So there are days where getting up and just walking to turn off the light is not only a hassle but painful. This makes it so easy for me. I could be laying down with ice on my knee or a heating pad on my back and decide I'm ready to go to bed and not worry about getting up and having to lay down in a position that won't hurt my back.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works great.,4.0 ,"I have a bout 25 WeMo switches in my house. About 80% were easy to install but a few required several attempts. It seems this is a common issue with these WeMo switches. Havin said this, I'm very happy with how they work. And once installed they work well. Just make sure you follow the installation instructions.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works great with Alexa!,5.0 ,"Simple set up: plug it in, download WEMO app on your phone, using WEMO app connect to device via wi-fi, name it something, teach it to connect to your home wifi. Done. For Alexa control, download Alexa App, enable the WEMO Skill, bind Alexa to Wemo, then have Alexa search for devices--found! Within the Alexa control you can also group devices into a single name. For example, we have three Smart Plugs and two Switches, and control them all at once by saying, ""Alexa, turn on mood lights."" I have one plug from another vendor and Alexa sometimes could not make that one work. Recommended highly.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Hardware is great... software needs work,4.0 ,"These things are really cool but they have some hangups as far as true home automation goes. The controlling software on my Android phone doesn't hook into applications like Tasker terribly well (notably you are forced to use 3rd party applications for this and they only work within the WiFi network that the switch resides on) and, while IFTTT plays nice with it (even from remote networks), logic is limited there. The obvious cross-over: using Tasker automation to dispatch messages to IFTTT falls flat on response times and generally depends on text messaging for reliability. Still, if you have need of a way to toggle switches in your home from a smartphone these fit the bill perfectly. Check your wiring before purchase; you are going to need a ground wire to install this.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I was hesitant at first because there are so many ...,5.0 ,"I was hesitant at first because there are so many reviews of connection problems. it was a breeze, the switches see your 2.4ghz network... new routers can broadcast on multiple frequencies. so, if you have a dual band router with a 2.4ghz network and a 5ghz, you should have them named differently and connect to only the 2.4. you should also be aware if you are broadcasting your ssid or not when trying to connect the switch. after connecting and using the app to turn the lights on/off I even tried firmware updates, power cycled the router and the switches themselves. everything connected back on its own right away. turned the wifi off on my phone and opened the app over cellular, the response time to trigger the light is still almost instant.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works perfectly every time. What else can you ask ...,5.0 ,"Works perfectly every time. What else can you ask for? My only wish is for them to come up with a dimmer switch. All this product does is turn the power on/off. It also works perfectly with Amazon Echo. Unlike the Hue bulbs that are kind of hit and miss if Alexa is going to understand what you are asking her to do. With the WeMo Alexa gets it right every time. But then again, you can only tell her to turn the power on/off where the Hue bulbs are dimmers.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
easy to install,5.0 ,"I don't know what all the negative reviews are about. These arrived with 1-day shipping, followed instructions on the insert in the box, and they work as they should. No issues, easy to install, simplistic app with step-by-step instructions. I mean, lets face it, if you don't have the slightest clue about super basic wiring (with pictures and descriptions to help guide you), basic WIFI setup skills, and the ability to use your smartphone, then don't buy these.

Does not stay connected to Wi-Fi,2.0 ,"Does not stay connected to our Wi-Fi for more than about 10min. If we unplug it and plug it back in, it will reconnect and then lose connection again. Since it can't keep the connection going, we can't ask Alexa to turn the light on and we can't control it from our devices. Essentially, we just lean down to the floor and press the button when we want the light on. Kind of a bummer, I wished it worked better.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

Bummer, because it appears to be a great product. Trying to leave a review for the Wemo Insight Switch, but it's linking to our Wemo Light Switch review. At any rate, the Wemo Insight Switch is great, easy to set up, and works well. Wish it were $10-15 cheaper, and that's why we'd rate it 4 starts vs 5.

Are you kidding me!?!?!? Love it. Every Thursday, in our neighborhood started who knows how long ago or how comically a reason for it, Thursday evening all the people who live here turn on their porch and driveway lights, trust me there is nothing in writing for this. However, people love it and it becomes such a funny tradition. So trust me, from laying in bed, or setting a schedule, but not so much on the latter, to be able to just say, ""Alexa, please turn off the front lights, thank you.""

"Great concept, less than reliable execution.",3.0 ,"When the tech works, it's pretty great. Keeps a schedule pretty well, nicely integrated with Alexa. I had a HECK of a time getting one of mine set up. Would never associate with WiFi properly. Then I had a power outage last week. Two of my Mini's lost their minds and wouldn't even turn on by pushing the button on the front. Slow amber blink. One of mine is still doing a slow amber blink but seems to be working ok. I had to reset the two that lost their mind. But get this. They both were connected to WiFi, I could ping them, but the service on port 49153 was not up and running. Got them reset, named them the same (had to reset both twice) and they picked up the old schedule.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"App is pretty, but product is rubbish.",1.0 ,"Terrible software architecture. While the app is pretty, and the build quality looks good, the app does not work well enough to warrant the frustration. Using a galaxy s6, an htc 10, and an iphone 7s I could not get this plug to find our local network with any consistency. Tried different authentication settings, and even tried wide open with two different wireless routers. When it could occasionally find the network, it would then lag out and tell you to restart the app. That never fixed it, so you'd reset the plug to factory, and try all over again. The app freezes a lot and regularly causes you to restart either the app or the device. Don't waste your time or be fooled by the pretty app.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Cool product and works well, until you have to contact Belkin Tech Support.....",3.0 ,"Installed and works with minimal problems. The WeMo app is very easy to use. Installation is quick and easy as well as scheduling, if you're using them to control your outside lights. It has an option to set it to come on at sunset and go off at a designated time or at sunrise, whatever fancies you; but my lights come on a bit before sunset. It goes off whatever sunset says on the internet I guess. THE WORST IS DEALING WITH BELKIN TECH SUPPORT! WORST TECH SUPPORT EVER! The Belkin tech support staff are no help at all and did nothing to help me with my product when I called them about the lights coming on early at sunset, so if you think that you may need tech support, find something else because Belkin support SUCKS! Otherwise, the WeMo is really cool and works well.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
What a frustration!!!,1.0 ,"So far this is an exercise in frustration. I've tried the Android app and get to the point where the WeMo sees my home WiFi (WAP only 25' away -- it had better see it!) I tell it to use that and I supply the key and then my Android no longer sees it. After resetting and starting over multiple times, I tried this with an iPad. That was a bit more successful. It saw the switch after it connected to my home WiFi and then it wanted to do a firmware update. Still waiting for the switch to re-appear after that. At this point I'm certainly unimpressed with the Android app and in general I'm unimpressed. I'll keep at it for a while.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works great. The pairing process is kind of a pain ...,4.0 ,"Works great. The pairing process is kind of a pain though. Most of my other smart home devices walked me through the pairing. This just gives you some on-screen instructions that you read. Then you have to exit to begin the process. So you either have to memorize the process or write it down. I thought the instructions were poorly written also. On the other hand, once you figure out the procedure, it is pretty simple to pair.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Works, but could use some ""rules"" improvement",4.0 ,"I used this for a night light type of lamp in my son's room knowing I could plug the lamp in and it could turn off in a set amount of time. That said, the app is missing a couple rules that could've made it better for me and how I'm using it. First off, it has a timer rule that allows you to set the amount of time you want it on, ok great. Then there's another rule you can set to specify exactly what times you want it on, also great. Not great, these cannot be used in conjunction with each other. In my case, I want to use the set times to turn on the lamp for the same time every night (7:15-8), however, when we're running late and it's after 8, I'd like to turn on the lamp and then use the timer rule for it to be on for 30 minutes. If I select this, it disables the set time rule and I have to remember to set it back. It's not the end of the world, but still. I also don't like the fact that I NEED my phone to turn the lamp on and off since the plug is hidden behind a dresser. That really stinks during the times we're running late and I can't turn the lamp on if I've left my phone somewhere else in the house.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
So far so good. It was easy to install,5.0 ,"It appears different devices reviews related to Wemo items are posted altogether. I am reviewing the wemo mini plug. So far so good.

but it worked like a charm when I switched over to my tablet ...,3.0 ,"Had a bit of trouble with the initial setup using my mobile phone, but it worked like a charm when I switched over to my tablet and began the install process fresh. After doing some research, apparently the Belkin software has some bugs that don't play well when mobile network data interferes with pairing the plug to a WiFi network...how they have not fixed this yet if kind of baffling to me. If I didn't happen to have a WiFi-only device handy, I don't think I could have ever successfully completed the setup process and would have ended up returning this plug for a refund. Once I did get it up and running, I was able to do everything I needed it to do: setup a schedule, configure an ""Away Mode"" for vacations, and successfully paired with my Google Home for voice-activated controls, etc. TL:DR the plug itself is a great product, but Belkin's install process is buggy as hell and almost became a show-stopper...so good luck if you only have a mobile phone!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Simple, easy to set up and IT WORKS!",5.0 ,"Simple and it works. Took about 3 minutes to set up the hardware, then schedule the socket timer via the app. After that: set and forget.

It's kind of cool turing the lights off from a Phone App,4.0 ,"It works great, but the backside compartment that houses all of the electronics is kind of thick and was tough to fit all the wiring back in the wall. The switch has a warm feel to it...guess the WiFi electronics are consuming some power (I'd say less than a dollar a month). I have it powering 6 kitchen spot lights (540 watts, the limit is 600 watts). So far there are no issues other than a few times the App couldn't see the device, but I think that might be due to the WiFi signal in my house being weak...anyway the device normally responds instantly, and when I had issues with connectivity (maybe 3 times over the previous two months), the App was able to find the switch in less than a minute by rescanning. It did take a bit of time to update the firmware..long enough that I started to worry (maybe an hour? when I was expecting a few minutes). This model doesn't work with three setups (two switches controlling one light).","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Good devices, lackluster application. Still Recommend",4.0 ,"The form factor on the mini is an improvement over the original. The unit is working well throughout my house, as I move it from place to place; I use it for various appliances that I want on a timer, either auto shutoff or auto-run (aquarium pumps, lamps, fans, etc.) Setup for these is still a little frustrating through the app, but once that's over with the widgets work nicely. 4/5 because the app and setting up the rules is not up to snuff with the physical product. App interface design is just... poorer than you'd expect. Overall strong recommend because these devices are just too convenient for the various home automation hobbies I have. I pair them with IFTTT and get great results.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
RedDot worthy performer,5.0 ,"The latest addition to the Wemo family is a real stunner. The RedDot worthy design added a piece of class to the walls. Even the kids, who ""supervised"" the installation commented how cool the switches (I bought 2 units) look. They could hardly contain themselves and couldn't wait to get their mitts on the controller. Suffice to say the dinner survived the onslaught and performed without a hitch. Flicker free performance from two brands of dimmable LED bulbs. Even the app has made huge strides in quality and worked very well. Perhaps the only small criticism I would level is the fact that the standard Wemo light switch and the dimmer do not have same radius of corners of their respective face plates, with the dimmer being visibly rounder. It is silly not to complement an existing line of products... But that's the OCD in me talking and perhaps it won't be visible to others. All in all five stars from me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
That sounds like an obvious notion,1.0 ,"This product is an interesting concept, but the install leaves much to be desired. Wiring is no problem. The issue is that the switch housing is considerably bigger than a standard switch. That sounds like an obvious notion, but bear in mind that this needs to go into a standard size switch box. As it goes, mine did not, and extricating it was a nightmare where the only way to get it out, to replace with a conventional dimmer switch, ended up completely pulling this switch apart. It ended up as expensive junk. Not happy about it at all. Leave it to the pros. Of course, they'll curse you, because this is a pain to install into a pre-existing box.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Easy to use and LOTS of potential!,5.0 ,"Awesome, easy to use product with loads of potential. I wanted switches to turn my porch and front path lights on at sundown, and off at sunrise. These switches offer that plus more! The extra $10 was worth it compared to normal timer-switches that would have to be adjusted every month. Plus now I have Wi-Fi control with feedback telling me they're on when I'm not at home! Plus not having an annoying hub to plug I to my router is a BIG bonus.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great product love the features.,5.0 ,"This light switch is great it was super easy to connect and get set up on the app. The best part about this product is it does not require a hub, which is the reason I purchased this light switch int he first place. The app is very well designed and I like being able to set my light schedule to adjust based on the sunset. This feature comes in very handy for exterior lights that I have. The only thing I would change would be the size of the night light it is just a little to small and if it was bigger it would be easier to see exactly where the light switch is . Would definitely recommend this product to anyone and have already purchased a second one.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
The Best Beginning to a Smart Home!!!,5.0 ,"Update: I now own two of these switches and believe they are wonderful. They also connect to the soon to be released Echo from Amazon making it voice controlled a switch. This is also making it capable of making the house a bit closer to a smart house. The product is wonderful on its own, but this switch leading the way into making your house into a smart house is just an automatic buy. I have been using this for over a month and it is wonderful! If you're trying to make your house a smart house this is a great first start. Some people have said they had issues if the Internet went out, but I turned mine on and off to test it and it reconnected without me doing anything. The only down fall is there is no three way switches.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I Can't Praise These Plugs Highly Enough,5.0 ,"For some reason, my Amazon Alexa was having trouble consistently finding and operating the TP-link plugs I have been using (the problem started when I switched routers). Just in the faint hope that another brand might work better, I found the Wemo plugs on Amazon and ordered them. Problem solved! The setup was incredibly easy -- as close to Plug & Play as you can hope for. Once installed, Alexa recognized them, and I've had zero problems using voice commands to control my lamps now. Great packaging, nice form factor (only takes up half of a wall outlet), and just a well conceived product.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Very tempermental - for the tech nerd with lots of spare time,2.0 ,"After earlier software problems with WeMo experienced last winter, they finally got their software act together, so I bought a second switch. Update several months later - I ended up with 3 WeMo switches and one WeMo Insight. Worked okay until Belkin pushed out new firmware, then I once again had problems and had to spend a lot of time with tech support. Tech support was pretty good and concluded one switch had physically failed (the other 3 devices worked okay) Getting a warranty replacement became a pain - they wanted either a credit card number (which I don't give out over the phone) for an advance RMA, or to send the switch back first, which would have left a hole in the wall with live wires unless I bough and installed a regular switch for the interim, plus they would make me pay for the return shipping. After all this, the ""defective"" switch started working again the following day - software, and maybe their server, has been buggy from time to time but hardware has always seemed okay. But it's too late to cancel the RMA. This product is okay if you are a tech nerd with lots of time on your hands - alright, it's neat when it works, but don't be surprised if you go through some pain and software bugs (and Belkin has admitted past security holes), which I thought they had put behind them.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"works well, most of the time.",3.0 ,"I have a variety of Wemo devices... I like the fact I can set up macros through alexa to turn all on or off. However they sometimes lose connection with some of the devices. the Phone control for the dimmer should allow me to adjust the light intensity without always refreshing ever device in the list. the priority of functions needs to be balanced against the user experience. I haven't tried other devices so I can't compare and contrast their functionality. I'm sure it's a manageable fix to the software. I also noticed that running the microwave interferes with some of the operations. this might be due to leakage of the MW-oven, and not the fault of the devices. I'd still buy especially if on sale.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Mini plug = life changer.,5.0 ,I began my WeMo journey with the purchase of a set of the insight plugs. Always strugggled with the side knowing it took up space on the plug strip or even on the wall. On the plug strip was where I had the most issues related to size. Now with the mini- it's a life changer!! (it's half the size of my other switches) Now it is plugged in to another plug strip I can even have one of those large black brick plugs that seem to only fit at the end or they take up the whole strip. The size is perfect! No longer have to move around plugs to accommodate my WeMo plug. Only wish is it would have the same features as the insight switches. Maybe it will one day.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Scary - wires crossed inside wemo ?,1.0 ,"Switched switches, got app on Android communicating easily enough - (beta version seemed to work a little better) However every time I tried to turn it on (from switch or phone) light bulb would flick on for a fraction of a second and go off and wemo would start searching for wifi. After setting a 'turn on' at 8:30pm via app it repeatedly turned on briefly for a fraction of a second every few minutes (probably the few minutes being the time it took for the wemo to do it's wif search and startup) So I took out the bulb and the wemo went dark! Strange I thought ... maybe it is intelligent not turning on if no bulb. So next I put the bulb back and disconnect the neutral wire... Wemo stayed on !!!! So from that I don't need to be an electrical engineer to deduce that my wemo is getting power from the two wires that make the live connection. Not from one of them and the neutral as it should be. And so when the wemo connected both live wires to make a circuit it shorted the power it was getting and lost power. When it lost power it disconnected the live wires and gave the wemo the ability to draw power from the difference in live wire voltages, Remember one live wire goes up through the bulb and back down to neutral. Now some might think that I wired it up wrong but the two black live wires connected to the original switch... there was a earth and neutral but they were connected to other wires to continue those circuits, And I don't think the original light switch had bad wiring as any other combination would have been a short of some sort.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"A little pricey, but no hub required!",5.0 ,"The outlet connects directly to a WiFi network, without needing an expensive hub. The Android app worked perfectly for setup and control, and now I can set timers and monitor power usage for anything I want! So far, I've used this to see how much power my computer uses, and currently I have my window fans plugged into it. If you have a window air conditioner, this would be a perfect tool to monitor and control power usage! There was 1 unexpected confusion when connecting to WiFi. I have a Google WiFi mesh network set up. Every other device only sees 1 WiFi network, but somehow this outlet can see 3 networks coming from each individual WiFi point. No big deal, just select the top network since that's the one with the strongest signal.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
A great but expensive dimmer,5.0 ,Installation and wifi setup were pretty straight forward. Love being able to dim the LED lights in our bedroom. The dim slider in the app is great! It lets you dim the lights from 1% all the way to 100% with everything in between. Setting it up with Alexa was a little difficult but I'm not sure who to put the blame on for that. Once we got it working it works exactly how we expected and couldn't be happier. I was surprised the though that you can't use the light at the bottom of the switch as a night light. Maybe that is something they can add through an update later on. Only negative is that it's a little pricey.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"... long-time Wemo user and have have used the original Smart Plug, the integrated Light Switches",5.0 ,"We've been a long-time Wemo user and have have used the original Smart Plug, the integrated Light Switches, the Insight Switch, the Motion Sensor and the Mini Smart Plug The whole system has been pretty terrific and incredibly convenient. The system alone was extremely easy to set up and helpful to have. It was enhanced when we started to connect it with IFTTT. That allowed us to create different behaviors. For example, when we left a specific radius around the apartment, all of the lights would automatically shut off. There were no more instances of getting back from vacation to find that we left the lights on. The entire Wemo system became 10 times more convenient after we picked up an Amazon Echo Dot. Simply being able to say ""Alexa, turn off the living room light"" and having it happen nearly instantaneously have a very Tony Stark / Iron Man feel to everything. We have recommended this highly to friends and have heard nothing but great things about their experiences.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
DEFINITELY BEATS OLD-TIME TIMERS!!!!,5.0 ,"Very easy to set up. Had a ""Handi Switch"" in the outlet before, but it finally died. When going online to buy another, apparently there was a recall on them because of heating issues, and a possible fire hazard. With Wemo you can set the hours that it will be on, name it, in case you have more than one, and even take a picture to add with the name. I'll definitely be getting another.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Makes my smart home... smart!,5.0 ,I love these smart switches! They are easy to install and operate. I use mine with the Amazon Echo voice control. I have a heater in my mud room that I can turn on before I get there so the room is warm when I do and my smart switch is set to automatically turn off an hour later. So convenient! The app allows you to set timers and you can use the switches for lights or anything that you plug in.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Wemo light switch - Installation Success,4.0 ,"Let me preface this review by stating I'm kinda of a geek and this was my second Wemo device I have purchased. Installed the Wemo light switch this week to control my outdoor lighting. Installation was very easy due to the well written instructions and the presence of a neutral wire at the switch location. Setup of the Wifi was as described in the instructions. Just remember to verify the strength of your wifi signal at the switch location using your phone prior to beginning installation. Linking the switch to the Wemo smartphone app worked as described as well, programming the switch to turn on at sunset automatically using the Wemo phone app requires no programming skills. Baring any future surprises I would rate this a positive experience. One feature missing from the Wemo app is the ability to send your phone notifications when the switch is turned on or off like you can with the Wemo Insight Receptacles.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Easy install, performs as expected.",5.0 ,"Looks super trick, installs easy, and works as intended. I bought the switch because it was a black Friday deal I could not pass up and I have been eyeing one for my ceiling fan. Now I have my fan and a few other devices controlled by my echo dot. Totally awesome. Be sure to inspect your current switch wiring before ordering. You absolutely need a neutral wire hooked up. In my case, my neutral was not hooked directly toy original switch but it did exist. If you do not have a neutral wire present it will require expensive electrical work to retrofit and make this work.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Terrible,1.0 ,"If the purpose of using this switch is anything other than manually turning lights on and off, you need to look elsewhere. The switch works great for manual functions, but to use any of the rules is a joke. The app is out of date and terrible to use for setting any rules. On top of that, the customer service is atrocious. Response time is supposed to be 24-48 hrs. I received my first email back after 72, then I got a call (useless) 2 days later. Next call was next day during work hours, when I requested an evening call so I would be home. The next person that couldn't help me took 3 days to reach out, and I had to decipher what they were saying because they could barely speak English. My last contact was almost a full month ago. I like the product, but the features of the product suck, Belkins customer service is terrible, and I would look elsewhere if you are looking for wifi enabled light switches. But if you are looking to replace your old switches with ones that are expensive with wifi that serves no point... then I would definitely waste my money on these again.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works great with my Google Home,5.0 ,"Great little device that works with my Google Home. Easy setup, easy operation. Now I am trying to think of other applications, to add more of these. Add: Even better than I thought, FLIC has buttons that allow you to operate the device from other locations in the house. Wonderful! I also just realized that WEMO had already thought out so good rules for the app, especially timed on to off after a manual start. I do like this.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great product-You will not be disappointed!,5.0 ,"I love this plug. It does exactly what is is described to do. Easy to install and use as well. I plugged my living room light in and paired it with Alexa. Now I can turn My lights on just by asking! Much better than the timer I was using, especially since time changes are not activated on a timer. I sleep later on weekends and feel more secure. I even installed a switch for my porch lights. Love Wemo and their products.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Won't dim all bulbs even if they say dimmer compatible.,2.0 ,"Have some under cabinet lights that were already on a dimmer and thought this would be a great place for a wemo dimmer. Well turns out the wemo dimmer cannot dim all brands of lights even if they say dimmer compatible. I had to unfortunately return the wemo as it would only turn the lights on and off, but would not dim at all. If they fix then I would rebuy, but cannot recommend at this point.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Hums...not in a good way.,1.0 ,"Compatible with ALL LED lights? Now that was a bold claim, but I gave this switch a shot anyway. I have your standard GE dimmable LED recessed lights installed. And sure, the lights turn on and dim beautifully. Sadly, they also hum annoyingly at all light levels. Maybe this switch is defective (that seems to happen a lot from the reviews I've read). Either way, this is one is going back.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Belkin , you dropped the ball!",1.0 ,"I’ve been a loyal Balkin customer for at least 18 yrs. They completely blew that rep w this product. In my setup, I could not specify the days I wanted the routine to run. Hours of time wasted. What was really scary was that the program kept chamging my selected times. Then I looked at everyone else and considered myself lucky. I won’t be buying another belkin smart switch. They don’t know what they’re doing.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great Concept, POOR Execution!",1.0 ,"I purchased these switches to control exterior lighting to my barn from the comfort of my house. Although the concept is great the execution is horrible from Belkin. I installed the 2 switches and tried to sync them using the app. I was able to sync the 2 switches but immediately received a message to update the firmware. I accepted the firmware update and the update kept running for hours. After an unsuccessful firmware update the switches would not connect no matter what I did. I even tried to do a factory reset but that did not work. After 3 hours of screwing around I finally decided to rip them out and send them back for a refund. This was after I spent time researching my problem on the internet. I read numerous complaints for the same problem plus others that said the switches constantly drop internet connectivity. I'm a Electrical Engineer and when I read these problems I decided they would go back. From my own experience, if customers are having numerous issues with simple wifi connectivity then they will ALWAYS be issues going forward. With the amount of customer complaints I'm very surprised Belkin keeps selling them knowing there's major issues with the product. Again, great concept but very poor execution from Belkin!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Solid device,4.0 ,"I use this product to turn my living room reading light on and off. The device itself appears to be well made and optimally designed. The failure to secure 5 stars is due to the app. It takes some fiddling to get it to do exactly what you want it to do. If you only wish to program and never change it is probably fine but since it's fairly user unfriendly, it makes you not want to reprogram for special occasions and the like. But given the price and apparent quality of the device I can recommend buying it and I intend to purchase more of their products and hope for app improvements over time. And in the end, I'd rather have a good solid physical device with a so-so app than the other way around when you are dealing with AC.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Terrible option for a smart plug,1.0 ,"This switch is terrible. It was much more difficult to setup than the TP-Link or TanTan Smart Plug. They also drop connections more than the Wemo Mini Smart Plug. On top of that, the other two switches are easily reset and connected by removing power for 10-15 seconds and then plugging back in. They reconnect automatically. I just wish the hell I had returned them within the window! DO NOT BUY.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Smart purchase of a great little smart plug! I plan to purchase more!,5.0 ,"I wasn't sure how this would work with my Amazon Echo Dot, but she and I both love it! It works great! I can turn my light on and off remotely and Echo can do it for me if I'm too lazy to get up and do it myself! This switch works very well, easy to set up. The directions were clear. I would highly recommend this product, in fact I'll probably purchase more Wemo products because of this. So very happy with my purchase, I love my WEMO!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
save the packaging,1.0 ,"Save the packaging. All I wanted was to turn on/off 4 lights when I am not here. Sunset driven on times. Clock driven off times. Dimming a plus. $300 worth of these devices worked as I programmed them for a few days. Then the app asked me for ""up to"" 10 minutes for a ""firmware upgrade"". Flash forward to hundreds of minutes and restarts. No upgrade. Some devices do not reload no matter what. Terrible tech support. Sanity requires a return to x 10.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

I love the long press feature where I can turn on or turn off other Wemo devices I select. It works well with Alexa. You do have to download the Alexis schedule app to make this one work with the other devices. Once you do that, it is discoverable and works well. The dimmer is another great technological device developed my WeMo.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Hardware good, Android app needs work",4.0 ,"I've had four of these WeMo switches for about three weeks now, and overall I like them, but the Android app to control them needs work. The switches are easy enough to install. Two of them I put in single boxes and didn't have much problem, although they were a tight fit. The other two I put in a double box and there wasn't enough room in the original electric box, so I did have to remove it and replace it with a new one with more space. The main problem I have with the Android app is that when my phone's on WiFi at home, the app routinely fails to recognize all of my light switches, often just three out of the four. If I hit refresh in the app, it often recognizes a different set of switches, usually still three but missing one it had just recognized. If I have WiFi turned off and just use 4G, the app consistently recognizes all my light switches. I don't use my phone much for Internet at home, so it's not a problem to keep it on 4G, but it'd be nice if the app worked correctly on WiFi.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Easy to install,5.0 ,"The instructions for the Wemo dimmer switch were incredibly easy to understand. It walks you through installation step by step. I was able to install in within a few minutes by myself, and I am not mechanically inclined. The one thing I didn't see before purchasing was what it is NOT compatible with. If you can switch your lights on from more than one switch, don't get this. I was lucky enough only to be using it on a single switch. It works great with my Alexa and it has become very useful for my living room lights. The Wemo app took no time to link with Alexa. The only negative is that the casing of the dimmer switch (the part that goes into the wall) is slightly larger than the one I took out. Therefore it does not fit into my junction box (which is an older metal one). Since my switch is sitting with two other switches in the same box, it will be difficult to get the newer plastic boxes installed. But overall this is a great project. I will buy this again for other rooms.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Great IOT light switches,5.0 ,"These switches work well and are reliable. The only inconvenience is that they need to be reprogrammed when you change your internet router. But, this is the case for all internet-of-things devices. The number of these are growing in our house due to their convenience and ability to schedule when they turn on/off. The integration with Amazon Echo is also a killer feature. I can turn on/off all my outdoor lights now by tell Alexa to do so. They're still a bit pricey to replace all the light switches in the house, but replacing the switches that can benefit from automation will provide a lot of convenience.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Worked after a horrible setup experience,3.0 ,The newer Mini Plugs apparently have firmware issues as so many other commenters have noted. Mine would not connect to Wi-Fi until after I unplugged my other (older) WeMo plugs and turned off the circuit breakers to my Wemo switches. It seems that the older Wemo devices interfere with set up. Wasted two hours before I read reviews that instructed me to try this. Almost return it to Amazon. Now it works fine.,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great product, but setup instructions to use with Amazon Echo are severely lacking!",4.0 ,"Great product, and general setup instructions are good, but setup instructions to use with Amazon Echo are severely lacking. I had to visit 4 different websites to figure out how to get it to work. And even after all that I still did not know the the echo vocal command to make it work. It turned out to be ""Alexa, turn (individual device name) on."" I renamed my device ""light"", so now ""Alexa, turn light on"" turns the switch on. Would have given 5 out of five if instructions were better. Wemo box contains no Echo setup instructions at all.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Huge fail. Purchased two Wemo Mini plugs back in ...,1.0 ,"Huge fail. Purchased two Wemo Mini plugs back in February 2017. Sporadically they would fall off of my WiFi network and had to either factory default them or physically unplug and plug them back in to reset. Found a band-aid on Wemo's community portal to adjust my WiFi 2.4GHz channel bandwidth to 20MHz, just to accommodate the Wemos. Even though I have multiple other ""smart"" devices on my 2.4GHz WiFi that have operated flawlessly under the previous setting. That change seemed to alleviate the sporadic issues but every time I either enable/disable guest WiFi or update my WiFi router and reboot, the Wemos drop off the network. I have to go around again and physically unplug/plug them in. Belkin says, sorry you didn't purchase them from Belkin.com so no refund for you. Other user's are complaining about the same so I am not convinced a replacement will resolve it. My Amazon orders indicate the return window expired in March. $70 going in the trash.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

large smart plugs for about a year,5.0 ,"I have had a number of the older, large smart plugs for about a year. They were easy to set up and program (the Wemo app for the iPhone is much better than the app for the z-wave Samsung SmartThings Smart Home Hub). They are easy to change programming as well. However, they are big. The new mini smart plug is smaller so you can have two on the same outlet and it is just as easy to set up and to program.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Good switch. Fast response even over cloud services,3.0 ,"Works well. Little tricky to first program and connect. Power sensing is excellent. Auto threshold and notifications work well. Wont connect to SSID-supressed networks. More detailed notifications would be good (like being able to get instantaneous power after power-on or power-off), but maybe this will appear in time.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Impressed,5.0 ,"My apartment doesn’t have any overhead lights and very few of my outlets have a switch connected to them, and the ones that do are in off places. This was such a game changer! I not only love being able to turn on/off my lights from an app on my phone remotely when I’m not home but asking Alexa to turn on my lights right when I walk in the door is so nice. Easy set up, no connection issues.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
"Great wifi enabled switch, but check your wiring ahead of time.",5.0 ,"First, check that you have appropriate wiring. Some switches do not have a common wire and thus will not work, and unfortunately this is fairly common. So, you might want to check your intended outlets prior to ordering because you're going to be in for a bad time should you order these switches and you aren't able to use them. So, with that said - you can pretty much skip any review that is complaining that it won't work for them because they do not have a common wire. It works, and has been rock solid for me.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Worthless,1.0 ,"These are great if you only need one switch. If you are planning on having multiple switches, in multiple places, then these are not for you. They are constantly trying to update, the update gets stuck and then when you kill the app on your phone the switches no longer appear. ???? Really?? Nice update. A call to support was answered immediately but they want to walk you through all the steps. No big deal, I did that with them. Still no resolution to the problem. Mega bummer as I like the idea of the switch.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Dissapointed at first,5.0 ,"This was very easy to install and connect to my wireless. When I went to program it that is where it seemed like a massive fail. It would not accept any start/stop time program and when I entered one and tried to save it, it simply hung and did nothing. I went online to see if there was any resolution and saw nothing. I tried the ""beta version"" of the software and it looked hopeful but when entering the program part of the interface it announced that there was an update and did I want to install it... yes! but it just took me to the play store where the option was to uninstall or open. I was pretty annoyed at the prospect of taking it out of the wall and sending it back so I started to fiddle with it and found that if you run the programing with the light actually switched on it worked the way it is supposed to, at least for me and now it seems to be working just as I'd hoped. I'll update this review if things change.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
I have a rice cooker that doesn't shut off automatically ...,3.0 ,"I have a rice cooker that doesn't shut off automatically. Once it's finished cooking, it will stay in the warm mode forever. I bought Wemo Mini so that the rice cooker will shut off completely after 1 hour. The installation and configuration was no problem. Right now, I have a radio connected to it and testing the Wemo Mini to shut off after 1 minute before I actually plug in the rice cooker. I have been using the Amazon Echo DOT to turn it on. Turning it on works well. However, automatic shut off of the radio off after 1 minute only works about 3 out of 5 times. When it doesn't work, the radio keeps going and going until I manually shut it off by giving the Echo DOT the command. I am not sure what causes this inconsistency, but as it is, I cannot feel secure that the Wemo Mini would reliablely turn the rice cooker off after given time. I have bought 3 other units so I can try them, but they are way past 30 days of return. I'd welcome any suggestions.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

No need to get up and turn on the fan now!,4.0 ,"I had absolutely no trouble getting this set up as a switch for our ceiling fan in the master bedroom. My husband did the wiring and installation of the switch itself, and I did the connecting. Works perfectly from remote locations and also just across the room. A nice little feature is that you can still use the switch in the normal way (turn on/off) and the Wemo app will reflect the switch status accurately. (I use an iPhone 4s, IOS 8.1.)

We are going to put some tape over it.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Can connect device to network but can't connect the app to the device.,2.0 ,The configuration utility on this device is severely lacking. I am able to set the device to connect to my home network without any hitches. I can see the device is connected to my network as it shows via MAC addresses on my router that it is connected but the Wemo app on my iphone and my ipad is not able to find the wemo mini and so I am unable to connect to the device through the app. The app is necessary to be able to connect it to my Amazaon Echo. So I am left with a device that can be swithched on and off by pushing the button on the device not exactly what I was hoping for no.

No matter how many times I restart it it just won't connect. There were some issues with wifi extenders. I have 2 Access points which have the same SSID & Password. This keeps my house covered. There was a firmware update that said to have fixed this? I am not sure it did. Just yesterday I only had 1 AP and 2 of my 3 light switches wouldn't connect for the life of me. 2 of the other devices (1 light switch and 1 plug switch) were working fine. They are just so damn temperamental.

The Light attached to the WeMo light switch won't turn OFF after WiFi configuration,2.0 ,"Given the mixed reviews on this product, I took a chance and ran into a major problem. After WiFi configuration was successfully completed, ""The Light attached to the WeMo light switch won't turn OFF"". Prior to configuring the wireless network, the WeMo light switch was able to manually turn ON/OFF the attached light. After configuring the wireless network, the WeMo light switch is able to turn ON the light either manually or remotely one time. Once the light is ON, it cannot be turned OFF manually or remotely. If the WeMo light switch is reset, the light will turn OFF (as part of the reset). After being reset, the light once again can be turned ON once but not OFF manually (via the switch) or remotely (via the phone). The WeMo ON/OFF green indicator light (located on the front of the switch), turns ON/OFF correctly when using manual and remote switching but the attached light does not turn OFF (as noted above). Configuration details - WeMo Light switch serial#: 221336K13018C7 WeMo Light switch MAC: EC1A59EA3045 WeMo Light switch firmware level: WeMo_WW_2.00.2725 Purchased : Dec 2013 WeMo App : Installed and used WeMo Android App version 1.1.0 and WeMo Android Beta App version 1.6 Wireless Router : Cisco Linksys E4200 with firmware 1.0.03 Smart Phone : HTC One (HTC6500LVW) Android phone running Android OS 4.2.2 with HTC Sense 5.0 Testing / Validation: 1) I was able to WiFi connect an Android Smart Phone to the WeMo Light switch, configure the light switch name and wireless network using both WeMo Android App version 1.1.0 and Beta 1.6 2) I validated the WeMo switch wiring - It is a simple installation that most DIYers will have no trouble handling in homes built after 1970. I am an Electrical Engineer with extensive experience. The WeMo light switch is wired correctly per Belkin Instructions, per state code, I would have it no other way. The line (110v hot), load (light), neutral and ground have each been validated using a DMM. I have a Computer Science background in both hardware and software development. Based on product research, it uses a Ralink RT5350F, a WiFi card plus MIPS System on a Chip. It contains RAM and SPI flash chips for firmware and configuration storage (I assume). A second board provides an AC adapter and switching relay. The hardware runs a modified Linux stack and appears to use UPnP communications. If interested, additional details can be found at - wiki(dot)openwrt(dot)org(slash)toh(slash)belkin(slash)f7c027 Btw - It appears an effort has started to port openwrt to WeMo devices replacing Belkin firmware. 3) With the WeMo line, neutral and ground wires connected and load (light) disconnected, the WeMo load wire reads 110vac regardless of switch on/off indicator state. 4) With all WeMo wires disconnected, the WeMo line and load wires have a measured resistance of 320 ohms. Given these results, I believe this indicates - a) The switch is always in an on state (once the wireless network is configured). The most likely cause is a Belkin firmware defect. b) The problem may be caused by a hardware issue such as a frozen relay. I've discounted this because the relay appears to function one time with each switch software reset. Still, the lack of other customers reporting this problem could mean a unique hardware problem exists. Belkin Support: I've made three support calls to Belkin reporting details of this problem. Belkin has a professional Level 1 support team (5 stars). They collected the problem details and attempted to resolve the issue by resetting the device and re-doing the configuration. These reset attempts did not resolved the problem. Belkin Level 1 has now passed the problem report to Belkin Level 2 support. Level 2 Support should be calling within 48 hours. I will update this review after Belkin Level 2 calls. Conclusion: Given the Belkin hardware design and Linux platform selection, the WeMo devices have potential. Quality control and software testing appears to have been short changed in the rush to market. Perhaps, pending WiFi control products from Nest, Philips, Ube, Bot, and others have Belkin in a rush attempting to claim a dominate market position. The market will favor the product that deploys simply and works reliably. Hopefully, I received a lemon and with Amazon's wonderful service, a replacement WeMo switch will solve this problem. UPDATE Dec 25th: Two business days have passed without a reply from Belkin Level 2 support. Belkin Level 1 replied to this posting on Amazon, I will reply and let them know Level 2 has not offered a solution. I plan to re-test a replacement unit. I will update this report if Belkin Level 2 support replies and provide information on retesting of a new switch. UPDATE Dec 26th: Another business day has passed without a reply from Belkin Level 2 support. Belkin Level 1 replied to this product post and asked for the Belkin Support Ticket# which is 016402119. Today I received a second WeMo Light Switch from Amazon. I swapped the prior WeMo Light Switch with the new unit from Amazon and everything worked perfect! The attached light now turns ON/OFF every time either manually at the switch or remotely via the Android App. After installing the new switch, the WeMo Android App installed a firmware update in the new WeMo light switch. I check the firmware level and found that it was the same level as the prior non-working WeMo light light. The non-working WeMo Light Switch was shipped from the factory with firmware WeMo_WW_2.00.2725 while the second WeMo light switch contained older firmware. Not a big deal, I point this out for the Belkin test team.

Wemo - so far so good,4.0 ,"So far so good! We bought the Wemo Mini so that we could either program our lamps to come on at specific times or turn them on remotely when we go out for the day and forget to leave a light on. We don't like coming home to a completely dark house! It's only been a few days, but so far the Wemo is working great. Setup was easy. I had considered getting ""smart"" lightbulbs but the cost was prohibitive, and I think the Wemo will be a much more flexible option. I can foresee using it in the future for more than just lamps. (I still haven't gotten over the thrill of turning up my Nest thermostat from my bed on a chilly morning, and I think I'll love turning lights on — or whatever — from my phone just as much.) I gave it four stars because it's really quite new and we haven't had a chance to test it thoroughly or see how it performs after a few months.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Keep Looking,1.0 ,"Hit the WeMo app switch and the lights may or may not go on or off. I have no confidence left after struggling with WeMo devices and iPhone app for nearly 2 years in 2 different locations with many different WeMo products, including several of these switches. I held out waiting for the promised Apple HomeKit integration, but all that talk from Belkin/WeMo has dried up. I suspect WeMo products couldn't meet Apple quality requirements for HomeKit. If you enjoy frustration and don't really need a switch to actually work every time, then maybe you will be ok with Belkin/WeMo products.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Works Great For Me!,5.0 ,"Before buying this, I had a problem where back my car into my curved driveway in the dark was a bit ""dicey"" with chances to catch bushes, etc. Now I can simply turn on the porch lights from my phone and can see much better. Over a year of use, this unit has been fully problem free. It ""just works"" every time.

Awesome and easy connection to Alexa!!,5.0 ,"This switch works with Echo and is so easy to install and hook up. They have taken a page out of Nest and have a video to help you install your switch. If you have never installed a switch, watch the video. Look for the white wires in the back of your switch box. It will be there and won't usualy be connected to the switch. The switch installs like a normal switch (except hooking up to the white wire) and after loading the WeMo app and adding skills to Echo your lights will be controled with voice command or your app. I installed 3. After taking a little time for the first one to make sure I did not mess it up, number 2 and 3 took about 15 minutes from start to finish and connecting to Alexa. Really simple.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Pricey but worth it,5.0 ,"I don't really understand the negative reviews. This is pretty slick, and you can connect it to Nest. A little pricey? Perhaps, but it's exactly what I needed to be able to turn on the light remotely for the dogs if I am stuck at work, and schedule the random timer when we are away. My only complaint is that you cannot control from an iPad. The app only works on the phones.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
... and setup to work with my Amazon Echo and Smart Things hub,2.0 ,"I have one of these installed and setup to work with my Amazon Echo and Smart Things hub. I installed it, set it up and upgraded the firmware to the latest and it worked great. I was ready to replace every switch in my house and start buying WeMo plugs, unfortunately the smart/remote part of the switch keeps failing. I set it up and it works, after a day it starts to only work sometimes, other times the Echo or the Wemo app is not able to find it. After another day it's offline permanently. I try the reboot and reset buttons on the switch but they do not work, I reboot the router and also no luck. The only way to get it back is a full factory reset and go through the setup again. This is not something I want to do with one switch, much less a house full of switches so I am holding off purchasing any more of these and will look to other vendors. At the moment, unless I go through another full factory reset it is just a light switch, at least it falls back to that. Other aspects of the device; it is a nice, clean, attractive light switch. It has a small light in the device that make it easy to find in the dark, it has a nice click when you activate it manually, the setup is straight forward. If the connectivity piece gets fixed this is an easy 5 star review.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"
Another great addition to the wemo lineup,4.0 ,"So far so good. When I bought my first wemos a couple of years ago, there were a little buggy. Not so anymore, several firmware updates later. I have several wemo light switches and a few insights. I added this one to my home theatre projector so it shuts off 3 hours after it's turned on. Our kids will play their Wii in the theatre room and forget to turn it off for days, causing the $200 bulb to fail prematurely. Can't beat the Alexa integration with Wemo either.

WEMO Smart plug works great once you can connect!,4.0 ,"The WEMO plug in works just fine once it is set up. When I plugged it is it did not automatically connect with my wireless system. Until you are connected, there are no directions to help you trouble shoot. No directions come with the gismo. There is simply a picture and they tell you to plug it into the outlet. After several attempts to get a connection, I googled WEMO and found an online chat option. I then did an on line chat with a WEMO representative. He walked me through the steps to set up. When finished I asked him where I could go for a detailed set of directions. His response was to look in the app itself on my phone. I also asked for a print out of our chat. He said that he would send it once our chat had concluded. I did not receive one.","Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

Love it! Here is a hint for Echo owners,5.0 ,"The new Echo compatibility works very well and allows grouping controllers under a single group name. I just set up three controllers and now I can say ""Alexa, turn on the living room lights"" and viola, they're on! Much easier than finding each lamp's on/off switch on a cord behind a piece of furniture. I can also schedule them to turn on and off when we're away from home. Go to the TP-LINK support site for full instructions and to the Alexa app if you're using an Echo to control the switches. The set up was mostly straight forward once I read the TP-LINK full instructions, but below is an more detailed hint for part of the instructions that weren't clear to me at first. I spent about 30 minutes puzzling this out, but the rest was fast and easy. The controllers can be configured with Kasa to be ""local"" or ""remote"" connected. To be controlled by Echo each individual controller must be set to Remote Control ON, in the Device Settings menu. That menu is accessed in Kasa with this process after the controller is initially set up: From Kasa's home page tap the device name; a screen for that device appears, with selections for Schedule, Away, Timer, an off/on button and at the top right corner an icon that looks like three little sliders. Tap that icon to open the Device Settings screen and then slide the Remote Control slider icon to the right so that it lights green. Do that for all controllers you want to be controlled through Echo.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Excellent start for home automation but understand wider context,4.0 ,"TP-LINK Wi-Fi Smart Plug HS100 Review A couple of weeks ago, I purchased a Smart Plug (HS100) to confirm that the product works with Alexa (Amazon Echo) and provides easy, reliable, secure remote control of plugged-in devices. Pros and cons are below. If you use consumer Wi-Fi (IP) webcams (Foscam, etc.), then you may be familiar with this product's technology and potential concerns about security and privacy. A webcam contains a microprocessor which can be programmed (with network data, operational settings and user options) and controls a camera which may be monitored using an app. A Smart Plug contains a microprocessor which can be programmed and controls a power switch which may be monitored using an app. Both local (LAN) and remote (Internet WAN) control are possible in each case. After confirming that the Plug indeed works as advertised, I was more curious about how and where operational data (supplied via the app) is stored and secured. That is, I'm not sure if all operational data is stored on-board the Plug in non-volatile memory in case of extended power outages and to secure such data locally. If remote control is used, what's stored in TP-LINK's Cloud server? [A Vine Voice review on 1-23-2016 indicated that ""the plug has internal storage for its own status and the schedule. ... a copy of the schedule is stored in the plug itself and does not rely on having a persistent internet connection to function. ... plug does rely on the power to keep time so that it can act on scheduled events.""] If the Plug is like a Wi-Fi webcam, then operational data is stored on-board, as can be verified using a local web browser connection to the camera's built-in web server. A Smart Plug, however, does not provide browser access, whether it runs a web server or not [there is a http port]. Remotely using a manufacturer's app, whether for a camera or Plug, introduces Cloud-based data storage and collection. And because Wi-Fi webcams and Smart Plugs are computers, they can crash or glitch and need to be reset. That's why reliability is a key factor. Time will tell. The Plug has a 2 year warranty. So, setup was relatively easy, and I discovered (as other reviewers have noted) that the best (but not perfect) instructions are in the Support section of TP-LINK's website, rather than in the included Quick Start Guide. * * * [...] How to connect my TP-LINK Smart Plug to my home network via Kasa? How to make my TP-LINK Smart Plug work with Amazon Echo? * * * 1. Install the ""Kasa"" app on your iPhone. 2. Open Kasa. If you want to use the Smart Plug with Alexa (Remote Control), setup a TP-LINK (Cloud / P2P registry server) account; and, after receiving an email activation message, login; otherwise, you may Skip setting up an account for just local control. 3. With your iPhone on a local 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection, open Kasa and then: (a) plug Smart Plug into an AC outlet; (b) Add Device > SMART PLUG and follow the instructions; (c) which say to go to your iPhone's Wi-Fi settings and connect to the Smart Plug's Wi-Fi network and then return to Kasa; (d) customize your Plug -- with a unique name, etc.; and (e) connect the Plug to your local Wi-Fi (with or without Remote Control, but Alexa requires Remote Control enabled). To use a Smart Plug with Alexa: A. On your iPhone in the Alexa app settings (via ""hamburger"" icon), tap on Smart Home and then the TP-LINK Kasa item and login with your TP-LINK (Cloud) account name and password. B. Scroll down Smart Home and near the bottom tap Discover devices (search your Wi-Fi LAN) to add your named Smart Plug, which will then be listed. C. With Alexa, say ""Turn on / off (name of plug)."" Pros • Good package and product design (both hardware and app). • Works with Alexa without a hub. • Setup relatively easy. • WiFi connectivity provides 2-way communication for control and real-time status (unlike one-way powerline modules). • Remote access without router configuration (port forwarding) [probably using company's (or subcontractor's) Cloud / P2P server like most Wi-Fi cameras]. • 15A load max. • Can unplug from AC without losing settings in order to relocate unit. • Moderate price. • TP-LINK supportive with comments on Amazon reviews. • 2 year warranty. Minor Cons • No support for 5 GHz Wi-Fi (okay as long as most routers are dual band). • Plug socket on front rather than the side or bottom (like on X-10 modules) of unit -- cord protrudes even farther from wall. • Status LED always on -- no way to turn off (like on Sonos speakers). • With Alexa, limited to only commands to turn on / off. Cons • Size (see photos) -- bulkier than standard X-10 appliance module (longer and thicker); even thicker than X-10 Pro appliance module and around the same length. • Covers both outlets if plugged into bottom outlet; covers upper edge of bottom outlet if plugged into top outlet, making bottom outlet unusable. Concerns • UL certification Some reviewers were worried about UL certification (which is not marked on the product or box). The manufacturer stated that certification was obtained. I searched UL's Online Certifications Directory (database) and found a listing: XACN.E481494 Miscellaneous Controls Operating Control, Smart Plug, Model(s) HS100, HS110 Last Updated on 2016-03-29. • Heat buildup when connected to some (high wattage) appliances Some reviewers were worried about the Plug getting too warm. I have only connected LED lamps (~10 W) to the Plug so far; so, I cannot as yet comment on possible thermal issues. The manufacturer stated that the Plug ""will remain well within a safe temperature range."" • Security and use of encryption, e.g., protection of data stored in Plug's memory and TP-LINK's Cloud. The manufacturer stated: ""In order to control your Smart Plug remotely, a TP-LINK Cloud Account is required. Your Cloud Account is safe and secured, and remote access to your Smart Plug is controlled solely by you through the Kasa App. Cloud accounts and Cloud servers are an industry standard for Smart Plugs and Smart Home devices."" ""The Smart Plug does not hand over or transmit any password information to us; It receives Wi-Fi profile information from your phone during setup, in order to connect the Smart Plug to your router."" • Privacy (privacy trade-offs) The weighty Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pose questions about data collection and sharing of personal data, anonymized or not -- for marketing & promotion, including partners and other 3rd parties. ""Device submissions"" ... device names, groups, schedules, locations, ...""usage information"" ... Software limitations • No offset possible on sunrise and sunset timer, but can use Away mode for randomness. Questions 1. Security: Is Wi-Fi password saved only in Plug's memory or also in TP-LINK's Cloud? Encrypted? 2. Security: Are timers, schedule, Away settings stored in Plug's memory or the Cloud? Encrypted? 3. Plugs do NOT communicate with each other, correct? Only with the TP-LINK Cloud? 4. When the unit is unplugged from AC outlet, are all settings (defined using the Kasa app) truly non-volatile? Does the on-board clock re-synchronize via Wi-Fi on the LAN anyway when plugged into AC again? UPDATE 6-13-2016 Purchased another 2 Smart Plugs on June 3. New packaging has UL certification mark, as well as new graphics and description: old ""Wi-Fi SMART PLUG"" vs. new ""Smart Wi-Fi Plug;"" old FC and RoHS marks vs. new UL and RoHS marks; model and part number unchanged.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Fully integrated with Alexa!! Better than more expensive Wemo outlets. **UPDATE**,5.0 ,"**UPDATE** Sorry, I didn't know this review had gotten this much attention, but I will clear a few of my points up. I have been using the smart home devices for over 2 years now. I started with the Wemo (now have 4 outlets 3 this size and 1 insight and 2 wall switches) 3 TP-Link outlets, and 10 Philips Hue bulbs. All controlled with My Echo and 2 Dots. For the first year or so the Wemo outlets were a pain every time the power went out. Through firmware updates this is no longer the case and they work just fine now. I also was not using IFTTT at the time so it not having IFTTT support wasn't an issue for me. I have since been using IFTTT which is why I've personally gone back to using Wemos over these, but still use these on devices I don't use IFTTT triggers with. I'll also clear up the ""intergrated"" questions. Before February or March of 2016, when using these you had to say ""Alexa, tell KASA to turn on XXXX"" you still technically have to use a skill, just it only now needs to be enabled and linked and Alexa will recognize these devices individually when searching for devices like Wemo and other integrated devices. Sorry I didn't reply to questions/issues earlier, I didn't know anyone had replied to my review. Any questions my email is in my profile. **Original review** I have been using Wemo outlets and switches for over a year now and love the ability to have Alexa turn things on and off by voice. I decided to order a few more smart home devices when Amazon released the Dot since between my Echo, it's remote, and now the Dot I have voice control throughout most of my apartment. It just so happened these were on sale as a deal of the day at the right time, so I ordered 2. You will see some reviews that state these only work with Echo using a skill, that changed in February or March and they are now fully integrated with Alexa. Over the past year I've had issues with my Wemo outlets dropping connection, and anytime I lose power I'd have to set them up again. This isn't the issue with these outlets. They were very easy to setup and link to Alexa, the app walks you easily through step by step in setting them up, renaming them for Alexa and getting them online if you'd like remote access. After setting mine up I decided to move them to another room. With the Wemo outlets one I unplugged them I'd have to set them up again, not with these. One I plugged them in at their new location they reconnected with no issue. I highly recommend these over the more expensive Wemo outlets. I saw another reviewer complain these cover both plugs on an outlet, this is true of all of the smart outlets currently on the market, if this is an issue for you I recommend doing what I did in a couple locations and get a cheap pack of 1' extension cords. Most of my outlets are hidden from view anyway so using the extension cords wasn't an issue for me. Now off to bed ""Alexa, turn off lights"" (yeah, it's been over a year and I still giggle like a little schoolboy once in awhile over this)","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

You can even use IFTTT to automate your lights to turn on and off!,5.0 ,"I connected them to my WiFi network using the Kasa app, and then connected the Kasa app skill to Alexa. Plus, IFTTT has a Kasa integration so you don't need to buy the $130 router just to schedule your lights to turn on and off. Here's how to automate your lights when you go on vacation: 1. Open a free IFTTT account. 2. Search for the ""date/time"" trigger so you can select when you want your lights (or scenes) to turn on and off. 3. Search for the ""Kasa"" integration, and connect IFTTT to your Kasa account. You can ten tell it to turn on and off your scenes or lights or whatever once your time trigger runs. Easy and free. (With the exception of your Smart Plugs, of course.) When you're home, you can use the Alexa app to discover your Kasa devices, and just speak your lights and scenes on and off. VERY IMPORTANT: While these Smart Plugs only run on the 2.4GHz WiFi setups, you don't need to stay connected to the 2.4GHz network on your cell phone. You can go back to your 5GHz network after you've set up your Smart Plugs. The Smart Plugs will stay connected to your 2.4GHz connection, though.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works great ... when it works ...,3.0 ,"I have it in the garage running a hot water recirculating pump. It occasionally looses contact with the router in a bedroom when my cell phone shows OK signal strength in the garage. I've had to reset it and reconnect in about 10 times in 6 months. The error message ""remote control disabled - try again when connected to your home network"" is annoying because I am connected to my home network. A manual setup requires setting the network on your phone to the one the plug uses, resetting the device, then hopping back to your own network. Don't buy this if you are averse to searching for clues on the Internet when the device doesn't respond.

"Easy to use, great app, works well.",5.0 ,"Very easy set up and all three have worked like champs...so far.... One question I had thier customer service was AWESOME! Easy ap, lots of control. Would suggest you set up your schedules in a varying manner. That is different days going on and off. I set mine up so that the lights come on as if I am using different rooms at different times with them going off as if I was going up to my bedroom to go to sleep. So play with the schedule to find your pattern, BUT vary it from day to day so it seems as if someone is home and wont seem to anyone outside that you are not.

Great when they work,4.0 ,"I ordered 3 of these, one for my studio, one for the kitchen and one for the bedroom. They are very easy to set up with Alexa (Echo and Dot). I love walking into a room and telling Alexa to turn the light on. It's also nice when I leave the light on in my upstairs studio and I don't have to climb the stairs to turn it off. You have the option to tell Alexa to turn it off or if you're trying not to wake people up, you can silently turn it off via the Kasa app. My ONLY issue I have is that these work about 75% of the time. Often Alexa will tell us the link isn't responding even though the green indicator light is on. So, when it works it is absolutely fantastic but I'm giving it 4 stars due to the frustrating times it doesn't.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Excellent, affordable option for getting into home automation - reliable, well built, and easy to set up.",5.0 ,"UPDATE 12/11/16: I've since purchased the mini version for my Christmas tree and it works just as perfectly as its larger siblings. Setting it up and using it is exactly the same as with the larger versions, and the only difference is that this only blocks one power outlet instead of two. I imagine that eventually they will all be this small, as there's really no reason to buy the bigger one unless you're looking for the power monitoring. Anyway, it still works great, was even faster to set up than the originals since I already had Kasa ready to go, and is especially useful for Christmas tree lights instead of bending or hunching down to reach the power. Awesome value, excellent price for the convenience. I still very strongly recommend this product. **************** After finally getting my Hue lights set up and working with Alexa, the next step of my home automation process was to begin to integrate wi-fi smart plugs into the equation. I wanted smart switches for my televisions, fans, air conditioners, air purifiers, and wax burners. What I didn't want was to pay through the nose for it. I've learned over the years that you generally do get what you pay for, but some of the pricing on these ""smart"" gadgets is ridiculous; the Hue ecosystem is insanely overpriced, and while I like it, you're essentially paying for the guarantee that you won't have to deal with the troubles that buying non-brand cheap Chinese electronics brings. I've purchased other TP-LINK products before (wi-fi adapters), but I was hesitant to get these because all of the other, branded, smart plugs were much more expensive. I thought I'd become a victim of the cheap Chinese electronics phenomenon. I'm glad I listened to the reviews and chose to buy one, because it works perfectly and does exactly what I wanted. It's well-made and was pretty easy to set up. I'd read that before there was direct Alexa integration it was kind of a pain to set these up but now, after they've added the integration, I found it incredibly simple. Here are some abbreviated directions that I've streamlined from TP-LINK's two or three setup pages; do it in this order for the easiest setup: 1) Download the TP-LINK Kasa app from your app store of choice. 2) Install and open the Kasa app 3) Create a Kasa cloud account (requires email verification), 4) Allow Kasa to discover your plug 5) Set your plug to ""remote control on"" to allow Alexa to control it 6) Name the plug (i.e. Bedroom TV) 7) Exit the Kasa app and enter your Alexa app 8) Swipe down to Learn More Skills and search for ""Kasa"" 9) Authorize Kasa in the Alexa app by entering your email and password 10) Go back to the main Alexa screen and discover new devices 11) Once Alexa has found it, assign your plug to whatever group you want it in (Bedroom group for Bedroom TV plug) 12) Enjoy The first one I set up was for my TV in the bedroom. Keep in mind, in order for one of these smart plugs to work with Alexa to turn your TV (or other device) off AND back on, it must have an auto restart after power failure function. If it doesn't you'll only be able to turn it off, but have to use the remote to turn it on. I have various groups set up in Alexa in order to achieve various functions. I've included the TV in the the ""turn everything off"" group so that I can turn it off at the same time as my 5 other Hue ambient lights. I've also got it in the ""Bedroom"" group so that I can turn it on and off by itself. The way you do this will depend entirely on how you have your room/house setup. For me, ""Turn everything off"" applies only to the bedroom and leaves the rest of the house alone, because this is something I usually only use when I'm laying in bed and ready to sleep, and I've already turned the other stuff off before going to bed. You could use these switches instead of buying smart bulbs, but I find it more convenient to have all the lighting independent of the plug. The normal white light Philips hue smart bulbs, and the other brands, are already less expensive so you're not saving anything. I find this option attractive for controlling non-lighting electronics. I've since ordered and connected these to my fans, air conditioners, wax burners, and electric fireplace. Anything you want to work completely with these MUST auto restart after power failure, because that is essentially all you are doing when you turn it on and off - removing and supplying a power source. For example, I had to buy a floor fan that had a manual mechanical switch because the one I had with a remote wouldn't function except to turn off. My air conditioner automatically restarts when power returns after the (simulated) power interruption that these plugs create, so I didn't need to replace it even though it is ""smart"" and has a remote and no switches. It's not something that's widely discussed, but important for people who are just getting into home automation to know. Until the technology improves to allow deeper integration, you're stuck completely controlling (mostly) dumb devices. All told, this is an excellent bargain for getting into home automation. It works very well, and the build quality is excellent. The only complaint I have is that it covers more than one socket on your outlet, but as I understand it, almost all of these do simply because it is necessary to house the wi-fi components. Expect to have to also buy additional power strips for areas where you plan to use these. They are less expensive than the ""brand name"" smart plugs and have excellent compatibility with Alexa. I've already purchased 6 of them, and will continue to buy more as I expand my home system. Pro tip: you can use one of these to control the power to a power strip, enabling to you to simultaneously connect and control more than one device. I've successfully done this with this Amazon Basics power strip ( AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip, 790 Joule - Black ) without tripping the fuse. Or, alternatively, you can have these Smart Plugs plugged in to the power strip and still maintain individual control. You'll only be able to insert two or three, depending upon your power strip, but you can expand the outlet easily that way. Your mileage may vary, however it's something to keep in mind.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
APP NOT AVAILABLE FOR FIRE DEVICES,4.0 ,"Just installed a two-pack of these less than an hour ago. So far, no complaints -- with the exception of a bit of vagueness in how to set timers to trigger at sundown, everything set up relatively easily and it was a snap to configure Echo to work with them. HOWEVER... Think about this: These smart plugs are sold by Amazon. The Amazon Echo is able to work with them. YET THE KASA APP --- WHICH YOU NEED TO CONFIGURE EVERYTHING ABOUT THESE PLUGS -- IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AMAZON APP STORE. Fortunately, my cell phone is not an Amazon Fire, but I really wanted to get the app on my Kindle Fire. Not possible. If all of your mobile devices are Amazon Fire related, you are plumb outa luck.

Very happy with how this product has performed,5.0 ,I was a little nervous about how well this item would work. I wanted to run a block heater for my tractor with this item and was nervous about the wattage draw. Now instead of having to leave my tractor plugged in at my cabin all winter long. It takes me about 3 hours to commute from home. I turn it on when I leave and my tractor is all warmed up and ready for snow removal when I arrive. It confirms with you when it turns the switch on and you can set a timer. You could tell it to shut off after a certain amount of time if you desire.

Love!,5.0 ,"I bought this in a package with the echo dot. I plugged my Christmas tree into it so that when I get home at night, the tree will already be on when I walk in the door. After Christmas, I plan on using it for a lamp so my house isn't pitch dark when I get home in winter. Last year I left a light on all day, but this is so much better. And I can set a schedule for on/off times and never think about it again. The only drawback, that someone else mentioned, is that it's too close to the other outlet plug and thus renders it unusable. Maybe TP can reconfigure this design. I will definitely be buying more TP smart home products.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great Product.,5.0 ,"Very good product. I have my eyes on this product a while back but not sure this brand name or the other. After read the comment from one of web site 'hot-deal.com', and it convince me to purchase this. I am so surprisingly it work the way it should. Turn off and on my hot water pump to around my house; I don't waste water while waiting for hot water from the sink. The app is little confuse at first, I need to save each step such on-time, save; off-time, save. More schedule more save, this is the only thing TP-Link need to modify little easier. Especially when black out happen, but the timer keep track with schedule.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Alexa, turn off Living Room",5.0 ,"Oh, Alexa, what did I do before I had you? TP-LINK offers this wifi plug that works with Amazon's Alexa, and it's currently 10 dollars cheaper than the most popular other wifi plug. I now have five of them, and although it's only been a few weeks, I am extremely satisfied. I have an apartment with horrific built in lighting, so I have lamps everywhere to keep the mood right. I have known for years that I have a penchant for laziness, but I cannot express the level of satisfaction I have when I sit on my couch and command lamps to turn on or off with my voice. Sometimes I do it just to entertain the cats. There are some pros and cons to the device: Pros: Does not require a hub - these plugs connect directly to your Wifi router. That's a good thing, but as you keep adding them your router is going to do more work. Relatively easy software setup - if you have an iPhone or Android phone, setup is a snap Reliability - I haven't had a failure yet Software - Scheduling is a plus, remote control from outside your home is an even bigger plus. I have a paranoia about my coffee maker burning the house down due to my father, so that plug turns on at 4am every day but it shuts off at 10am (except on weekends!) so I never have to worry about it. If you're on vacation you can setup a lighting schedule, but even if you forget you can just turn the outlets on from your phone wherever you are in the world. Cons: Does not require a hub - customers with cheaper/leased routers may run into a device limit Software - you NEED an iPhone, Android phone, or one of those tablets to set this device up. Apparently programming for an actual computer was too much work for TP-LINK Interference - don't put them near a microwave and expect them to work. Some people may experience less than ideal performance if they have a large house and their wifi router is not nearby. I live in an apartment, so I haven't run into any issues with reception. I am very happy with this plug, and if you have to choose this one or the more expensive option, I cannot think of a reason to get the more expensive option. They offer identical services.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"I have 5. TP-Link will reveal your password to the entire Internet. For only 30$ more, you'll get a NIGHTMARE of a product.",1.0 ,"Recent firmware version makes it incompatible with standard wifi. Wow... I had to upgrade it's firmware because its reliability was horrible, and now it doesn't work at all. reliability? maybe about 10 to 15 %. And the software? It allows you to turn on/off, but if you go to enable remote, it says you're off the network...even though you just turned on the light.... Also, if you go ask questions on their web forum, take a minute to notice that it makes you create and transfer credentials on a non-encrypted link (HTTP vs HTTPS), yet you are forced to use encrypted wifi in your own home. Did I mention TP LINK IS NOT RESPONDING? get used to that, Alexa owners Good job China.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Not WEP compatible - so you may need to change your security type!,4.0 ,"I liked the fact that the price of this Smart Plug was about $10 cheaper than the other big brand one and seeing as how I really just wanted to plug in 1 floor lamp, I didn't need the fancy energy readings, etc. Does it work as stated? YES! Was it easy to install? Not really. Right out of the box, I downloaded the app, plugged in the Smart Plug and started following the directions. I hit a road block when I got to the part asking for WIFI password which would link the Smart Plug with my WIFI. I entered my password, and received an error message stating the ""password is not in the correct format for WEP"". I am not a super techie person, so this is where I scratched my head and tried the password again. After numerous phone calls with my service provider and then TP-LINK which patched me through to what sounds like an overseas tech support person who ended up just saying the same thing to me ""password is not in correct format for WEP"", I did more research and this is what happened: if you have WEP security on your WIFI, your password has to be either 5 or 13 characters long for this to work. If you have any other number of characters, it will not commute for some reason. My solution was to call my service provider and I had the security changed to WPA2 which did the trick. After it authenticated my password, the app indicated I was ""Almost Done"" and stayed on that screen for a good 2 minutes after which it stated it could not find my network. I looked at the Smart Plug and the power indicator is solid green and the WIFI indicator was also solid green - based off of the indicator chart that was provided, this mean the power was on and it was connected with my home WIFI network. I tried to turn on and off the floor lamp connected to the plug and it worked! So basically, the app itself is not the best, but the actual plug works well enough for me. I connected it to my Echo Dot and everything is a go!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
x10 / BSR User For Decades Now Using TP-Link with Excellent Results,5.0 ,"I have used the BSR, X10 system since the 80's and I just converted to the TP-Link system to operate LED lamps that X10 just does not work with. Do not be intimidated by this system as I had the first one going in a few minutes without reading any instructions! A username and password needs to be created in the Kasa for TP-Link app (iPhone) for me. The Kasa app gave step by step instructions for setup. Repeating timers are simply made and edited on the Kasa app, stored in their cloud, providing off-site backup and reliability. I believe timers are stored locally in each device should the internet go down, home wifi should still work if power is on. YOU WILL NEED INTERNET ACCESS AND WIRELESS (wifi) FOR THIS TO WORK PROPERLY. My older friends living in very remote locations that do not have internet would have a problem with this system. I bought this one module as an experiment and it destroys x10 response and consistency wise. Go for it! Your search for a great simple home automation system just ended!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Great for turning on anything you plug in, like lights, and makes things easier for busy people!",5.0 ,Love this for use at home or traveling. I primarily use these smart plugs for lamps also for some kitchen appliances. It makes it easy to turn off lights if I forget and I am in a different part of the house using Alexa or set the coffee pot up and set the smart plug to turn it on in the morning. I can also turn lights on and off when I am away or from home using the Kasa app and check to make sure the coffee pot is off. TP-Link has a section on how to connect your smart plug and use it with Amazon Echo. It requires downloading and using the Kasa app and it is easy if you follow the directions posted on their website. You can name each plug so that you know where and what it controls this is especially helpful if you are using it for a lamp. The Kasa app also has a feature to randomly turn on your lights when you are traveling and it works well. I had neighbors express surprise that I was not home when I used this feature while traveling. These work well I had one smart plug lose the connection I reinstalled it and no more issues. Nothing works perfectly but this has worked well and as expected since I purchased and installed them. The information on TP-Link's website is a big help with setup and to learn how to use this with Echo. A useful item that makes things a bit easier for busy people.,"TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Bumpy but successful connection process.,4.0 ,"Once you get the switch connected, it does work, buuuttt, theres the rub. It found my WiFi easily and connected quickly, but getting it operating thru Alexa was the trick. I install networks fairly reguarly, so Im familiar with connecting various devices. Its when it was time to get Alexa to find it, then control it. I found it was an instruction and software issue, NOT the hardware. After following several ""tips"", I got it working, but this process is not even remotely intuitive. I found the Kasa software to be lacking in the extreme. To call it simple is an understatement. Alexa does run this switch, but offers no other options for control. Ie: turn on lamp at sundown etc. The Kasa app does offer this thru its simple user interface, but I didnt get this to run it thru them, just Alexa. This is my first step towards a ""smart home""! A slightly bumpy, but successful first step. Now to see how long this switch lasts. Only operating a floor lamp driving a large LED bulb.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Great product! Hints for remote control not working...,5.0 ,"I bought this specifically to go with my new Amazon Echo - and to be able to setup various times that things would go on and off while we are away from home to give the impression we are still home. The setup through the TP-LINK KASA app was easy, at first. It worked right away, with one exception - remote control wouldn't work. I would try to enable it and I would get ""Binding failed, error:can not connect to the server"". I then tried resetting it completely and re-adding it about 15 times. Nothing worked and I was getting pretty frustrated. I was still able to setup a schedule for being away but I also wanted to tell Alexa to control my lights! I was able to fix the issue after thinking overnight about it. My wireless router has a general ""Firewall Security Level"" that doesn't provide much detail. It's a HiltronTechnologies router provided through my cable internet company. I was looking around in the settings and remembered the default setting for this was ""medium"" and I had changed it to ""high"". I changed it back, saved, and tried re-enabling remote control via the KASA app and it was already on and working now. I then was able to easily add the skill for KASA to my echo and I can tell Alexa to turn my lights on and off. So hints - if you get this same error, take a look at the firewall settings on your wireless router!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Price between $12 & $16 dollars. I would give this smart plugs a 5 star rating, they work better then the more expensive plugs, wemo & TP-LINK which cost anywhere from 30 to 59 dollars.

Excellent Solution- Easy to Set Up and Use,5.0 ,"Easy setup, works as advertised. The app for the iPhone is easy to use, tap the button and when it turns green the device is on, and adding or editing additional Smart devices is also easy. You install the app, plug in the smart plug, set your mobile device's WIFI to the smart plug's WIFI network and follow the directions. When operating the devices, either over my home network or the LTE network there is no perceptible delay. The only downside is the plug is rather large, so you will only be able to use one of these on a dual wall outlet, and only on the top plug. I will be adding more TP-Link Smart devices to my network.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
GREAT and easy to use outlets,5.0 ,"I got this AND a pair of thin ones since outlets are different for each to fit.

Had to get out of bed to get to the lamp switch to turn it off when going to sleep. NOW, my Alexa app in the house or my Kasa app on my phone turns the lamps on or off. NO hassle, easy to use!

Only 2.4Ghz and can't auto reconnect under spotty wifi,3.0 ,"This plug only connects to 2.4Ghz wifi and not the 5Ghz, so buyer beware when you purchase and during set up. I spend a few cycles toggling between wifi frequencies on my mobile device to set it up. I also have a spotty wifi connection in my home, and if my router, Echo, and mobile device gets knocked off the wifi it doesn't auto connect when the internet comes back online. Then I have to set it up again, which is annoying. I wonder if there are more durable plugs out there that can withstand spotty wifi connections and scenarios where it's having to constantly re-connect on it's own. That being said, it works well when it's set up. The mobile app is straight forward and it syncs to my echo easily.

Once I made my mind up this guy was set up and working. Have schedule set to come on and off when we are gone.

They were easy to set up and it's really nice to be able to turn lights on and off anywhere I have a network connection. You can pre-schedule on/off times or set them to away and they will turn your lights on and off randomly during a time range that you set. If you want to be able to manually turn you lights on and off, you simple turn on the light with the app and leave it on but use the switch on the light to turn it on and off.

One thing to note is that you have to have wifi to connect to the device's wifi so I was on my cellular service for just moments while the device connected to my app. Easy as pie to set up!

"Easy set up, but make sure your router is strong enough!",4.0 ,"I purchased three of these outlets-- one for each floor of my townhouse-- to allow me to turn on lights without finding the awkwardly placed light switches. The set up was fairly simple- plug in the outlet, use an iOS device to connect to the outlet and program the settings, and you're done (The Android app finds the outlets on its own, without having to switch over to the device's wifi signal). They worked great until I had all three of them up and running and then none could maintain a steady internet connection on my wifi. None of my other wireless devices have any connection problems. I tried resetting the plugs and programming them again, only using one plug, but nothing worked. The only solution I could find was replacing my router with a more powerful (and more expensive) model. Once that change was made, all three outlets keep a solid connection. I've also used my Amazon Echo to discover the devices and now the lights are voice controlled as well as app controlled. It is pretty nifty, but make sure you have a newer modem that sends a strong signal throughout your house. Without that, you may experience connectivity issues.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

"Easy to set up, works great with Echo! Very nice quality!",5.0 ,"After reading the disappointing reviews on Wemo, I was looking for another wifi outlet that did not require a hub. I found the TP-Link plug at less of a cost than Wemo. I purchased 2 to test with my office lights. Setup was easy. I plugged them in, downloaded the app, and followed the onscreen instructions. They way the instructions lead you through setup it was incredibly simple. The entire process took less than 5 minutes. Once setup I got to name the outlet and choose a picture. I tested it with the app and it worked perfectly. Next was setup with my Echo Dot - also incredibly easy. I linked Alexa to my TP-Link account (NOTE: You need to verify your email address to activate your account before you can link with Alexa. Make sure you check your email and do that step first). I waited about 5 minutes and used the Echo app to search for smart things, and it found both outlets. I tested it by asking Alexa to turn them on and off and it worked perfectly. PROS: * Cost!!!! * Incredibly easy setup * Works with Echo/Alexa natively. Also easy to setup * Quality - well packaged with excellent documentation. Plug is nicely made - does not look or feel cheap. CONS: * Cannot think of any! We'll be getting more of these for use at Christmas and in other rooms. Very happy with this purchase.

Want a Plug that Works with Echo and That's Easy to Set Up? Here it is!,5.0 ,"I purchased 2 of these as a test. I wanted to try them out before I got more. I hooked them up to two lights in my study.

You can name them what you like and can group them. So I can turn one light on at a time, or off, or turn them both on or of at the same time. Making them work with Alexa was equally as easy. I just purchased a Dot for this very purpose. After setting them up you just go into Alexa and enable the skill then click a button to find them. It does and you're good to go.

I originally purchased it to control Christmas lights and table lamps but i've found myself using it for loads of other things such as controlling a room heater (set a timer to come on before I arrive home and turn off when I'm away). Very easy to set up and sync to your wifi. Only complaint is that it's too big, it literally takes up 2 outlets even though it is 1 plug. Great plug if you can deal with loosing an extra outlet. Otherwise get the smaller one instead","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works With 220V - Love It,5.0 ,"Great gadget! I bought two TP-Link Smart Plugs knowing that at the time it wasn't supported on Google Home but still thought it was great that I can use KASA app to control and schedule my living room night lights. Now that I can control any device using my voice via Google Home/Google Assistant, it'll be even more cooler. I live in South Korea and these work on 220V even though it lists only 110V. Just buy the adapter to change the plug type.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works ok,5.0 ,"Not bad at all. I am using it for a lamp in my entry way when I come into the house. Hooking it up to Alexa takes a bit of patience and requires the downloading of an additional TP Link app. It does lose connection with Alexa occasionally and you have to play with it in the Alexa app to get it back on but other than that, not bad.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works,4.0 ,"I bought one of these a number of months ago and had to return it because It wouldn't work with my router or something. On cyber Monday through echo they went on an unbelievable sale and I had to get one. When I got it I figured I would wait till I got my Google home. I noticed that the packaging was slightly different and figured I would try it again. It worked! Now I don't have to get a Google home and can get more of these. Over all, the product is pretty great and works as advertised. I wish it was smaller as it does cover both plugs. I currently have it on a power strip so that's not a big deal. I also wish it integrated with wink or smart things so that I didn't have yet another app on my phone. It does work with Alexa once the skill is inabled. This worked great.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works as Expected Perfectly,5.0 ,"This smart plug has done everything that I was hoping it would be able to, and has given me no issues whatsoever. I currently have it connected to my Echo Dot, but in the near future I may be getting a Google Home and if so, I will have to see if this will link up to that as easily as it did the Dot. Originally, I had concerns because I thought I had read in either a question or a review that it would not work properly if plugged into a power strip instead of a wall outlet, and when it came in it was a little thicker than I originally thought, and could not fit behind my bed with my lamp plugged into it. I warily tried it plugged into a nearby power strip, and it has worked perfectly! No issues so far, and hopefully in the coming months I will have more opportunities to get a few more of these Smart Plugs and try them out.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Great For Difficult to Reach Lamps, Etc. With Alexa.",5.0 ,"I have this connected to a lamp that is difficult to reach but we need for light. Alexa now can control this lamp through the Alexa App, and the Kasa app. Getting this set up was easy. I downloaded the Kasa app first then just followed the directions. We could not be happier! It is wonderful to just have Alexa turn the lamp off and on. Looking forward to seeing what else I can use this plug for. The only critical thing I have to say is that it does hog up the outlet. I have the link plugged into a multiple plug outlet, there are six plug in areas, so the Link cannot dominate the outlet.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

I had to try to change the wifi network I was using (other smart devices and Alexa are on a hidden wifi network), and the darn thing lost its little mind. Two hours of heartache and failure later, it's going back. I'm sure the idea of bridgeless connections are appealing for people dabbling with smart devices, but TP Link's decision to go it alone and make integrating their products with everybody else's so difficult ain't good.

Does what it's supposed too.,5.0 ,"These work great. I have more issue with the annoying aspect of turning off a light and my Google Home repeating that it turned off the light audible after I already saw the light go off. It was obvious when the light went off that it worked. I do not need the Home to tell me again after the fact. Gave feedback to Google about that. I have an Echo too, but haven't tried to control them with it yet.

Great Product,5.0 ,"I have only been using the Smart Plug for one day, but it does everything it is supposed to. I bought this after recently moving into a top floor condo that only had window air conditioning. If I turned the air condition off before I went to work, it would take a good 2 hours once I got home to cool down the condo. Leaving it on all day obviously was going to run up my electric bill. I bought this Smart Plug and set the schedule to have my AC turn on two hours before I got home, and then turn off a half an hour before I leave for work. For what I am going to save on my electric bill, it was completely worth the cost of the plug.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

My experience with this smart plug and Alexa,5.0 ,"I use this with my Amazon Echo device. I ask Alexa to turn it on, it turns on. I ask Alexa to turn it off, it turns off. No issues. There have been times I wanted to turn it on but I was on the phone and didn't want to be using voice commands while talking to someone, and I couldn't take the phone away from my head to open the app to turn it on, and I was trapped. In those situations you can you walk over to the device and press a button on it that turns the device on. But I wasn't about to do that! So I muted my phone call, issued the voice command, and unmuted the call. My friend had no idea. And that's my story and my experience using the smart plug with Alexa.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
First one was 5 stars second one was 4,4.0 ,It's a great way to get your feet wet with home automation. Much simpler and cheaper than dealing with hubs. They work flawlessly and have certainly paid for themselves in terms of convenience and saved power. The app is pretty intuitive and I've linked them to alexa. The second one I bought wouldn't connect to the app without some trial and error. If you are not tech savvy there is a chance you'd have an issue but 2 out of 3 were flawless.

Good start for this getting their toes wet with smart home tech. Alexa compatible,5.0 ,"Ok this is pretty dope. I got sold on the whole smart home Gadgets. The bedroom lights are wired through XFINITY and can be turned on with cell phone or on a schedule. This plug I put in the living room where I have my echo dot. After an easy set up, turning the lights on or off is as easy as “Alexa turn on the lights” or “Alexa turn off the lights.” My apartment is older so most the light switches don’t do anything (that I can tell) so it’s a perfect excuse to make the place a little smarter.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Pricey, but does NOT require a hub.",5.0 ,"Works great with my echo. Pricey, but does NOT require a hub. This was the primary reason for choosing this over others. Those that require a hub don't have enough range (distance) unless you have many spaced close together so that they can relay the signal to the most distant one. This works anywhere in my house where wifi works. I feel that wifi is the way of the future for home automation. Those requiring a hub are just trying to shave costs. Wifi will eventually become as cheap.The only downside of wifi is that it requires more power making battery operation impractical. I used it on a lamp that's positioned such that it's hard to reach the on/off switch. Now I just say ""Alexa lamp on"". You can give each device a different name. I used ""lamp"" since I only have one.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
This is such a big difference than its competitors,5.0 ,I can say with out a doubt this is a far better product than its competitors. I have had this over a week now and it has not disconnected one time. The packing is top notch and gives the feeling of a quality piece of equipment. Direction are easy to understand. Connected smooth and seamless to Alexa and now my wife is turning the lights on and off every 5 minutes. You can set timers and auto on/off function and away mode. We connect to lamps to a 3 way plug spitter and use two lamps for one device.

Easy Setup but NO Apple HomeKit Support,3.0 ,"I have several TP-LINK products and they work well so I chose the TP-LINK plug. Unfortunately, I assumed that since the smart plug supported Alexa, that it would already support Apple HomeKit since it has a much larger customer base. The assumption was not correct. I went through setup which was quite simple and the app looks great but the switch is not compatible with Apple HomeKit, thus it is not really useful to me and my home automation needs.

I have the Alexa mini, and they connected to each other no problem (via the app / wifi). I use it to turn on the lights, and nowadays when its getting hot, to turn on the fan when I need it. Overall, I haven't even begun to find the potential of this outlet to control other accessories, but thinking of new ways to make use of this smart plug is quite exciting. Only complaint, same as most reviewers here, is that the plug is on the bigger side, so for sure it will take up two outlets on the wall. That's why they made the mini I guess, but it's still an amazing product.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Easy way to make your home smart,5.0 ,"Works like a charm, i love it!!! it works awesome with my Amazon Echo dot and the app that you use to manipulate it is very easy to use. Where i live the electricity will come and go ever so often. when it returns it takes awhile to initialize but once it does it works great. Awesome little device at an affordable price point. another thing i love about this product is that it is plug and play, it doesn't need an hub and for me that was a major selling point. the only downside i have with this is that the device blocks out a part of the other outlet. on my wall it is two outlet, and i use both of them, so the other plug doesn't go all the way in, however, i make it work just the same. if they could make future versions a tad bit smaller where it goes into the wall then it would be perfect.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Took some time to set it up, but it wasn't difficult once I found out what the 2 buttons were for and how to get them to blink according to the directions. Setting up the wifi was a breeze once you downloaded the easy-to-use Kasa App. This one also has a timer (the bulbs don't), so you can turn it off in a few hours. This is great for me because you might lose track when you are out and about. It is a little bulky, so you probably won't be able to use the other plug on that outlet.

Don't get frustrated, make sure you verify your email address, and wait ten minutes after that to continue. I found there was a little delay before the verification actually hit the account.

Walk into to my home and say ""Alex turn on the living room light"" , the light in my living room comes on and Alex replies ""Okay"". What can be easier? I have been using these for months now without any issues. These are one of the least expensive options that work very reliably. A light just above the outlet is green when connectivity is solid and amber when there is an issue. You can also manually turn the lamp on by depressing the aforementioned light, so even if your network is down you can still turn on the lamp or whatever you have plugged in, without having to remove this smartplug.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

"Nice, simple on/off control",4.0 ,"The TP-Link Smart plug is a great entry level smart home product. The setup is easy and requires only a smart phone. The plug works as it should. The commands are send to the device almost immediately from a phone or from the Amazon Alexa (natively supported!). The scheduling that is built in is a nice feature. I'd like to see more events available as it only supports 16 so if you wanted something done hourly you would not be able to do it within the device. It does however support sunrise and sunset control based on your local time. The Runtime feature is also handy, particularly if you are using it for something like a fan, pump or heater. It would be nice if it supported dimming for lighting. I understand that this is a challenge since it is also an appliance device but it would be a nice feature. Overall, I think that this is a solid choice if you are just starting out with smart home control or if you simply need to control one thing without a lot of fuss.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
I like the scheduling aspect of this.....,5.0 ,"After reading a lot of reviews, most purchasers have this product (HS100 TP-Link Smart Plug) interface with other voice command devices. I purchased for a specific purpose. I have two separate controllers for outdoor landscape lights. Due to the configuration of my home and outside, I have two separate sets and the units that control them are located inside (garage and the basement). Therefore, the HS100 would not be exposed to outside. When I bought the two controllers I could have had them app controlled but that would have been $200 extra per unit. The units come with a simple pin timer. However, the times are hard to set to come on at the the same time and then the times typically gain or lose time. I started to research the smart plugs to see if I can use those rather than the timers. I put the smart plugs in the units and they appear to work. I have the lights off during the holidays. I tested them with holiday lights in the house that were on timer and both sets of lights for each timer come on at the same time. The current manual pull pin times have gained about 15 minutes in less than a month. Setup of the plugs - actual it is easy if you follow the directions. Of course, I did not. When I created my account and password, I kept using the new password when it was asking to connect to my wireless network. If you have to call support...good luck. They are oversees (maybe China) and rush to get you off the phone. However, it was my error. Scheduling - again it would have been faster to follow the directions, but you can figure it out. I linked both units to the app and both are set off and on at the same time each day. So far, no issues. For both of these times I have been home. I am going to test what happens when I am not at home for these times and also when my phone is powered off at these times. I will keep you posted. Away - they have a nice feature that lets the time vary when the unit powers on. This is so the connected light is not coming on at the exact same time each evening. I am not sure I will purchase more. I would like them at the holidays as I have lights on 6 different times. It would be nice to have them all on the same cycle and exact time. Not sure it is worth the price to be using them about a month a year.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

works great needs IFTTT support to compete with wemo.,5.0 ,Works great.

17...? Too many? lol,5.0 ,"These things are awesome! I tend to not review as much anymore because...well...it is a time suck and priorities have doing other things. But in this case I feel compelled as I noticed the most helpful critical reviews had scared off a few would be purchases in describing issues when using high wattage. In my home I generally have lamp lighting and these things allow me to will lights on with must my voice (Echo Required) or the Kasa app manually or via the schedule. I also have gone a little overboard with Echos and Dots that allow me to speak just about anywhere and turn up the heat or have lights on and off. I am in the tech business, so this is the kind of thing that happens... But I just want to let people know that I have had no issues at all with these things...well...occasionally Alexa needs to be told twice to turn something on or off...but that is very much the exception. And my experience is with over 17 of these units...I did take advantage of the holiday pricing to ramp up...lol. With regard to wireless connectivity...I use this with my drive lights where the outlet is some 50 ft or so from the access point with no issues I had to purchase oversized outlet covers for the drive lights and the xmas lights I installed...but it is totally cool to have them all come on at the same moment via different outlets.. Their form factor could use some improvement, as you have to have a fairly small plug to use on the other outlet...as larger ones will not fit...about the only bone I have to pick.

I have written a review on those and they have only gotten worse since I wrote it, due to Wemo ""updates"" which have only served to make both the plugs and App less usable. As far as the TP-Link plugs (and I have also purchased and installed TP-Link Switches), these work great and, while the App could be a little more user friendly, thus only 4 Stars, they so far out-distance the Wemo stuff that the decision on which to buy is, in my opinion, a no-brainer. The set-up process is, I guess, standard for these types of devices, but it worked flawlessly with each of the 4 plugs and 5 switches I have purchased. They are reliable and I have had absolutely no issues with them as far as function and reliability. As I said, the App is a bit clunky and could be more usable, but it is not THAT bad and, again, completely blows away Wemo's in functionality. They also all work flawlessly with my Amazon Echo with minimal delay. As a matter of fact, I have made the decision to replace the 3 original Wemo plugs I bought with TP-Link plugs because the Wemos have become unusable in 80% of their function and completely unusable for a lot of uses for which I purchased them. I apologize if this seems more like a ""comparison"" report, but I figure that if you are reading the reviews, you are trying to decide which Smart Plug brand to purchase. TP-Links would be my very clear recommendation.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
app is fine. Well built,4.0 ,"Works well, app is fine. Well built. Very easy setup! -1 star because: 1) Had to sign up for yet another ""cloud"" account w/ TP-Link. 2) Devices can only be controlled through smartphone/tablet app, not via a traditional laptop/desktop computer. (Would have liked a web interface or something.)","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Great, easy to use product",4.0 ,"At first, I had a lot of trouble getting it to work. Please note: these things do NOT work with custom firmware routers (DD-WRT, OpenWRT, etc.) I had DD-WRT on my router, and I just couldn't get it to work no matter what. It couldn't connect to the router, and I have no clue why. So I flashed my router back to stock firmware, et voila. It worked just as expected. You download the ""Kasa"" app, plug in the plug, and go through the on-screen instructions to set it up! It's very simple. It then gives you the ability to turn on and off things you plug into it remotely (I used mine for a space heater). You can also setup a schedule for it to turn on. For me, I have my heater turn on at 630am so it's not cold when it's time to get out of bed. This is also good for automated lights and other things. PACKAGING: the packaging it comes in is very good, and very nice looking. The instructions are semi-ambiguous, but they can be. The app walks you step by step through setup. This plug is not compatible with 5GHz WiFi networks...so you need to have a 2.4GHz WiFi network in order to use this. Honestly this part is my own mistake, but I only bought the Smart Plug, and not the model with energy monitoring...DO NOT make this mistake. It's literally 4 cents more to get the one with energy monitoring, and it would be well worth it just for some cool extra information about your plug and monitoring it. Currently, you can only see how long it's been on...not that useful for much. Anyways, amazing product, very nice and convenient, and glad I purchased. Giving it 4 stars because the headache I had with DD-WRT and because a model without a feature is the same price* as the model with a feature...very unfortunate as I don't want to wait to send this back and forth.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Easy! Simple integration,5.0 ,"I got this in the mail. 10 minutes later I was hooked in to Alexa and up and running. First get the Kasa app on your phone from Google Play. Set up an account. Hey Amazon Put the Kasa app in your app store. No brainer! Go to Alexa app (you should have it if your playing with Echo, Dot or Tap or your appropriate Kindle Fire tablet) either from Amazon App store for Amazon devices or Google Play for other devices. Enable Kasa on that. Follow directions to discover. Then play til you get bored. This is a tool not a toy!!! lol","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Good for nightly router reset,4.0 ,"I bought this to automatically reset my router every night. I have the switch go off and then back on a couple minutes later. The app was easy to install and the included instructions were pretty easy to follow. Pros: easy to setup but note the switch when first plugged in is in the off position, easy to program via app Cons: when you first plug in the switch it is switched off. So I had to keep my router plugged in to its regular spot and setup the switch individually, the other negative is that this switch is massive. When I plug it in it takes up multiple spots on the power switch. If you could rotate the plug on the back or streamline the case it would be nicer. You cannot use the plug directly below it on my power switch or the two above it. Overall it does what it is supposed to and it seems to keep my router working so far.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Works well, but have to sign up for another cloud service",4.0 ,"A little tricky to set up, but once working, works great. Oversized sock hog will block two plugs in a power strip. Tricky set up and requires cloud technology to work (yes, have to sign up for another cloud service). But it is nice to just say, ""Alexa, turn on Tammy's lamp"" (which is across the room from where we normally sit). I imagine it would be nice for coffee in the morning (on your schedule) or even toast. I would have wished it would talk directly to the switch through my private network than through another cloud service.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Easy, easy set up; but you can only use one per receptacle",5.0 ,"Set up was easy and fast. Box included the open source licensing, which was pretty cool. But we returned it... The plug blocks the other outlet so you can't plug two of these smart plugs into the same outlet, and I have two lamps plugged into a receptacle that we'd like to control individually. We ended up returning the three we bought in favor of Zwave receptacles, which are ultimately cheaper anyway. But if you don't want to buy a hub or use openHab, go ahead and get this. I was able to use it with Wink, Alexa, and Siri.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
I love these plugs,5.0 ,"I love these plugs, they give me control of all my lights from my cellphone! I figured out how to program on/off times or ""randomize"" them for vacation mode. I can set pre-programmed themes for certain plugs to be on, but not others. This is cool. I manage them all on my phone. I have 5 set up right now. One of them controls the power to my laptop charger so it doesn't constantly overcharge. I wish I could control my light switches with these too.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great Value - I Bought Two,5.0 ,"This product works great, looks great and is priced well. I purchased two of these for lamps in my house. They are very easy to setup and installation is obviously easier than a smart in wall outlet. It is very convenient to turn off and on the lights from your mobile device. I was also impressed by the response time. I would argue that you couldn't tell a response time difference between using the actual product switch over using the TP-Link Kasa app. You also can set a schedule that only turns off or only turns on the outlet. This is very convenient to turn off products at certain times (i.e. when you go to bed). I highly recommend these to anyone looking to save energy, who is lazy or who wants to impress some friends. Pros: -Cheap -Easily installed (just plug it in) -Clean look Cons: -Not cross-compatible with all smart home systems (none are)","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Smart Plug.,5.0 ,I bought my grandson an Echo for his birthday. I wanted him to use it to turn his light off and on so I also purchase the Smart Plug. I have not been able to get it to work with the Echo. However I learned I need to download an app to make it work. I just have been too busy to do so. I am sure it will work fine when I get the app and program it properly so the Echo and the Plug will talk to each other.,"TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
1st time smart plug user,5.0 ,"My 1st smart plug but, definitely not my last. Set up was a few steps and about 5 minutes. It probably would have taken less time but I integrated it with my Amazon Echo. You need to download the ""Kasa"" app in order to use it. Once you download the app, it's just a few steps to connect. I'm currently using it to turn on/off the Christmas tree. I have it set using the apps timer function. On @ 4:30pm and off @ midnight. I can also tell the Amazon Echo to turn the plug on/off as well. The Echo will recognize your smart plug by the nickname you give it. You can also use your phone or tablet to turn the unit on/off from anywhere. Overall a great buy. Just wish they were a little less expensive...","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Works with ""Alexa""",5.0 ,"One of my favorite purchases this year. I have a whole house fan by ""Air King"" (also available here at Amazon). I mounted it outside of a window. When I wanted to run the fan I had to go outside to turn it on. I was going to install a switch inside to control it, but never got around to doing it. Then it dawned on me that I could control it with a smart switch. Now I just say ""Alexa start fan.""

Almost Perfect,4.0 ,"Before we get into what I don't like about this, it should be known that I love this plug. We use it on a bedside lamp combined with an Echo, and Alexa turns our light on and off every morning and evening without fumbling for the pull chain. It's great. I just have seen a few ways it could be better. Software can be a bit finicky - has a tendency to reset with a power loss, but not every power loss. And even then you just need to reintialize - all of the data is still saved about the device name. After initial setup, the next one I use will be much easier (already having an account, having the phone app, etc.). Naming was easy, and the app even comes with little icons to remind you what is plugged into the outlet. Biggest issue, and the only reason we're not at 5 stars is the plug covers both wall outlets. The housing is too big on the bottom to allow even an ungrounded connection beneath it. You could get short, grounded extension cables (6 or 12"") to overcome this, but it starts to become ridiculous. Fortunately the plug we use only had the lamp on it, but it's still annoying. Would also be nice if the plug was actually on one of the sides instead of head-in. Naturally, this unit sticks out from the wall, but then once you have your switched device plugged in, the wires extend pretty far. If the switched device plugged into the side, you could avoid the wires coming out several inches from the wall. Maybe that's another reason to get the short extension cord. So plan for this to be in a hidden location where you only need to have one device plugged in, and it's a winner.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
The future is now!,5.0 ,"If you like home automation as much as I do, these things are awesome. These can be controlled through wifi, a phone app OR my favorite, with the Amazon echo. I can turn on and off my bedroom lights just by saying, ""Alexa, turn on bedroom lamps"" and BOOM! There is light. It's excellent coming home, walking into the bedroom with hands full. Love it.

Spoiled Rotten,5.0 ,"I have 3 of these, and I am ordering more. I have used these in 3 different houses with 3 different wi-fi networks (use through Amazon Echo). I am not very tech savvy, but even I have been able to re-program for new wi-fis. The only drawback I found is that Alexa doesn't always ""see them"" well when they are hidden behind big pieces of furniture (like sofas). For the price, I can deal with that.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
It works but not very well,2.0 ,"Reliability of these so called smart plugs is extremely spotty. About half the time, Alexa isn't able to recognize or connect to some or all the smart plugs I have connected in my home. Control through the app however works every time, so it's clearly not a network connection issue, but an integration issue with the Echo itself. Repeated complaints and assurances from TP Link that the issue was being worked on or had been fixed have actually resulted in decreased reliability. I definitely would not recommend this product.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

I have no reason to believe that I will not be completely satisfied with it as I have been with the other ones I purchased. If your a gadget kind of electronics person you will love this product. You don't need a hub and you can control it from your smartphone anywhere in the world. You can turn on your lights and or appliances such as a crock pot or slow cooker by simply using the app on your smartphone.

... support for TP Link to set up what looked like a simple plug,2.0 ,"It took 3 hours including and hour with technical support for TP Link to set up what looked like a simple plug.I had no problem when I set my Echo Dot with my Wifi and love using Alexa, When I tried to connect this WiFi plug to work with Alexa it gave me a variety of problems. First it didn't recognize my email. After starting over with the same email it told me my Wifi was not connected. I had to start over several times with the lovely customer service rep, Claire but even she was baffled when all was connected but it would not turn on my light. tried different rooms , different lights. finally got Alexa to recognize it.

Works great...but a little bulky,4.0 ,"This is a great cheap option for a smart light, also works great with Amazon echo! The only issue I have with it is its a little bulky. When plugged into a surge protector strip outlet it will block the outlets on either side of it, forcing you to pretty much only plug them into the wall outlet. Also makes an audible click when turning the outlet on and off. Besides that have not had any issues with it after about 3 months of use.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
AC control,5.0 ,"Works great. I bought two. I was a little concerned that they weren't going to work for my application but they did. I wanted to use these to control my AC units, one window and one portable. I was concerned that if the power was cut to the unit then restored that the unit would default to off. This thought is because when you plug in an AC it is always off. Well I guess that's because you usually turn it off before you unplug it. I know some units are different so you can try unplugging the units while they are running and then plugging them back in to see if they turn on. Both of my units work. I use these devices to turn the ACs on while on my way home and they work pretty good. Sometimes it wont work the first time but usually does the second. You can see it the power is turned on in the app.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
A Very Smart Plug,5.0 ,"Works great with Echo. After signing up with for an account on the TP-link Kasa app I went to the Alexa app to link.

Supposedly with the app I set a schedule, but this works for me on voice command. .Better yet I got this smart plug for under $9.00 from Alexa special deal.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Excellent Smart Plug,5.0 ,"This plug works great with our new Dot. So far it has worked 100% of the time and was very easy to set up. I will be adding more in the near future for other items in our home. The only thing that I do not like is its over sized shape and size. It covers up extra outlets either on the wall or on a power strip. Hopefully the next generation will be smaller.

Worst customer service,2.0 ,"I have had TP link for about two years now and they work perfectly fine. But tonight alexa gave me the error that TP link is not responding. So i called Amazon for a quick fix. The Amazon technical support who answered my call was TOTALLY CLUELESS on what to do. after all the unplugging and turning off of different devices she ultimately asked me to disable the skill on my alexa app. When I was trying to enable it again, I can no longer do it. It's giving me the error system temporarily unavailable. I was then transferred to another guy who said that it was a known error and that I have to wait for maybe a week to get things fixed. That was totally unacceptable. A week really?? They told me that my phone app still works anyway but goinh thru my phone looking for an app to turn on the light is no better than me switching the lights on. My mind can't comprehend how something like this can't be fix faster. I don't understand how someone can just say sorry we don't know when this will be fixed, maybe in a week. For now just wait. Really??? That was the worst customer service. I'm now thinking of getting rid of these TP link plugs and just get hue for all my lights.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

And if connected to Alexa, make sure you disable and then enable the skill again if you linked it to a new account. Otherwise, you would not be able to operate your appliances with Alexa.

"Good with Ipad, not so good with Alexa.",4.0 ,"I bought three of these when they went on sale a while back. It took a while to figure out the correct way to get them set up. I wasn't aware you still had to go online and set up the app on the Kasa web site before you could us it through the internet or Alexa. You can do this with a smart phone or Ipad, it didn't work with a PC. Once I found that out, it went smooth from then on. I first used my Ipad to locate and set them up, no problems here, I could turn them on from anywhere in the house or outside, I haven't tried them from another location yet, but it says they will work away from home. What's keeping me from giving five stars is that it's so hit or miss with Alexa. I have two Echos, one in my house and another in my mom's house and they both have the same issues. The first issue with Alexa is range. I can't put these farther than 7 feet from the Echo. I can get about 10 feet away in my mom's house. Weird thing is that I tell it to turn on a light and it says ""OK"" and nothing happens if it's over 7 feet away. I tried it with all three units. Keep in mind that it works fine through the internet app and my Ipad. Sometimes, Alexa can't seem to locate one or more of these devices and I have to reset them and set them up again. Also, if you plan on using Alexa, sometimes, you have to say your words a certain way to make her happy. I can say ""turn on the living room light"" and Alexa sometimes responds "" I cannot locate a device called Living Room Light"". Then I say ""turn the living room light on"", and Alexa says ""OK"" and it happens if I'm in range. If you just plan to use your smart phone or Ipad to control these, you should have no problem, they seem to work fine every time.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
I am in and out of the house quite a bit and sometimes I don't return until late night so it is great to be able to turn a light,5.0 ,"I bought this to pair with my echo dot and it was worth every penny. I did have to download another app but it took a minute or two including set up time so not a problem at all. I bought it for two reasons...I am in and out of the house quite a bit and sometimes I don't return until late night so it is great to be able to turn a light on inside before I enter so I don't walk into complete darkness. Secondly, and most importantly, we have had some burglaries in my area, and it is a great deterrent and creates the illusion that someone is home when I turn on the light remotely.

"Six Month Review: So Far, So Good",4.0 ,"I purchased this product to pair with an Amazon echo. My living room does not have a switch-controlled light or outlet. Rather than walk around the room turning several lamps off and on, this product (paired with voice control from the echo) made the perfect replacement. The Good: Six months with no problems. The app is surprisingly powerful. It logs the number of hours the plug operates each day and the scheduling ability is really nice. I've set my lamps to cycle a few times throughout the day to make burglars look elsewhere. This feature would be really nice for anyone who has electric rates that vary by the time of day. The Bad: The app was difficult to set up with the Echo. I'm not sure whether to blame the echo or TP-LINK but it was not a simple process. The app software is very fast but the connection to the device is painfully slow. I just tested at it took a full 90 seconds to load the schedule and runtime data. Other Thoughts: The price is just okay. It was over $30 dollars at the time and I felt a little ripped off. In retrospect, I feel much better about it given how powerful the app is. I picked up a second one on Cyber Monday for less than $20 and feel really good about it.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Cheaper than Wemo. Compatible with Alexa.,5.0 ,"I ordered two of these smart plugs for my living room. One for an LED cherry blossom tree I have and another for a tiffany style table lamp. I have both of them scheduled to turn on and turn off at different times during the day but I also like to show off that I can do it with my voice using the Amazon Echo. Its so cool just to say ""Alexa turn off the bonsai tree"" and it responds immediately. There is NO delay whatsoever. And if you're not home, you can remotely turn them off or on no matter where you are through the app which is nicely designed. One of the plugs has been acting up a little, turning off or on randomly, but for the most part it is really reliable. I would totally recommend this product. The native integration with Alexa is a huge selling point for this. All you have to do is download the TP-LINK Kasa skill and then the echo will be able to find the plugs immediately after you do a device search.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"The setup was easy, BUT app doesn't work with Amazon Fire Tablet",4.0 ,"It's big, so if you have it plug behind a couch or a bed, you have to move it at least 4 inches with the plug. The setup was easy, BUT app doesn't work with Amazon Fire Tablet. I put this in Amazon since most apps don't work on their tablet. For my use, I'll plug my stereo receiver and have Alexa control it.

So cool,4.0 ,"One step hung me up but lack of savvy on my part. At the risk of sounding stupid, I'm going to say this in case it might help someone else. (Please let there be at least one person out there that will say 'ahhhhh - now I get it' after they read this...) Anyway, found the Kasa app, plugged in the smart plug, proper lights blinked. Then the directions say to select Wi-Fi settings from your iPhone and connect to your Smart Plug's Wi-Fi. I either misread or misinterpreted, but when I did this, it looked like my VZ Wi-Fi was going away. Then finally I reread - you ARE connecting to the Smart Plug's Wi-Fi network (just like the instructions say) momentarily. I enabled the Alexa app so that she could discover my smart plug. EZ-PZ. The directions actually are clear and easy. It was just that darned little Smart Plug Wi-Fi step... I unplugged it, moved it to another room. It automatically came back on (couple seconds) and from my living room, I asked Alexa to turn on my smart plug and on went my hallway light. Only downside - the smart plug takes up both outlets - you only use one outlet to plug it in, but the unit covers the second outlet. Not what the picture on the box shows. Still it's a great product and I plan on getting a couple more.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"These things are great- I've got 3 of them, ...",5.0 ,"These things are great- I've got 3 of them, and will probably get more once I can get my hands on an amazon dot for the other rooms in my house. I have them set to different names, and you can group them as well- for example, my three lights are all in the living room, but sometimes I just want to have the corner light on when watching a movie. I can say ""turn on the living room lights"" and all 3 will turn on- or I can specify which light to turn on or off via my Amazon Echo (the corner light, the hall light, etc) Even guests have no problem ""getting"" it, as it's fairly intuitive as long as your labels make sense. It's simple to set up, and I haven't had any connectivity issues and have even lost power a few times (just for a few minutes at a time) and haven't had to reset anything. The Kasa app works wonderfully- as sometimes I've forgotten to turn off a light, and while in bed I can grab my phone and turn off the lights without yelling and hoping that Alexa will hear me. (Please, Amazon Dot, come back!) The one drawback to these plugs is their size- they will take up both slots on your outlets, so it might not be entirely suitable for all areas, given the aesthetics of the bulky device. I have mine hooked up with 1 foot extensions to get around this. I considered taking a star off for having to use these extra cords to make this work for me, but given that these devices have worked so flawlessly otherwise, they're keeping the star.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Good addition to the Amazon Echo Dot to get Alexa to turn on and off the lights and music.,5.0 ,I like this a lot and will be buying more as I add on a few Amazon Echo dots. It took a little work to get it set up properly but nothing too bad. You just need to follow the directions - duh!! There was a disconnect that may have resulted from a brown out but was simple to correct. Just unplugged for a minute and plugged it back in to the socket.

Great parental tool for limiting screentime.,5.0 ,"I purchased 2 of these. To give an Idea of what they can do, I have one in my daughter's room attached to a surge strip where all of her electronics are plugged in. Tv, Playstation, etc. I set the schedule so that it will not turn on until after dinner, and shuts off at bath time. (During the week.) I also have it synced to an Alexa Dot. I named it privileges. If she is spending too much time in her room on the weekend, I say Privileges Off and everything shuts right off. When schoolwork is done, and chores are completed I say, ""Privileges On,"" and she can go enjoy them. There is also a timer. Great attention grabber for when kids go into zombie mode watching a movie. Best thing? I don't have to repeat myself.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Easy and Reliable Echo Integration,4.0 ,"Was looking for Echo Smart Home compatible smart plugs that didn't need some centralized management unit. The reviews on the HS100's by TP-Link mostly sounded favorable so I bought a couple to try out. The Echo integration works in two steps. First step is to configure the plugs with the TP-Link KASA app which requites setting up a free account and configuring each plug one at a time, naming the plug and joining it to your network. Once that's done, you can control them with your KASA app off your smart phone. The first one configured up fine but my second one had issues which were resolved by doing a rest on it twice and it finally assimilated. In the KASA app you can also setup schedules and calendars for your individual sockets as well, it's actually a decent app. The next step is the Echo integration. This involves opening the Echo app and going to Smart Home and learning the KASA TP-Link 'skills'. You will link Echo to your newly created KASA account and then discover devices. The devices will show up as whatever name you gave them in the KASA app. This is also the name you will use when you say Alexa turn <name> on (or off). So setup is fairly easy as long as your follow the correct order of operations and your plugs cooperate. So far I've had them installed for a couple days and they have not dropped off the network yet. They're on my 2.5ghz wifi 'guest' network. The plugs and the rest of your wifi devices don't necessarily need to be on the same wifi network. If you're into security and your router is capable, you could setup a new wifi network just for 'things' and connect your HS100's to that new network. This would get around some of the issues people have with spaces not being support in wifi network names/passwords. As long as everything has open access to the Internet, Echo can control the HS100's just fine on the same network or a different network. From what I can tell, Echo does not directly talk to your plugs. Echo talks to KASA cloud services and KASA in turns talks to your HS100 smart plugs. So far very happy with the HS100's. Will update if anything significant happens positive or negative with them in the future. But I plan on buying more (when they're on sale again). Update 9/8/16 : These HAD been working flawlessly but for some reason 24 hours ago, they suddenly stopped working. I don't believe that it's Alexa, both my plugs still appear in the Alexa app as learned. However when I open the KASA app, it no longer shows the devices so pretty weird how all of a sudden they've disappeared from the KASA app. I suppose to fix it i'll need to start the configuration from scratch again . -1 star for sudden problems with no explanation.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great and easy to use device for home automation,5.0 ,"These outlets have become essential to our home automation. This is the first Christmas I have used them and I love being able to turn everything on and off from the comfort of my couch (using my phone). I also use one (through Alexa) to turn on bedroom lighting when coming up the stairs. The setup is a breeze...I have to believe the people complaining about the setup are just not following the directions properly. That being said, the price seems to jump all over the place. I have seen them ranging from $24-50 on any given day. Truthfully, $24 is about all I think this is worth so I only buy when I see it at the price.

CAVEAT EMPTOR: Works well but no HUB compatibility!!,4.0 ,"UPDATE 10/22/16 Recently I wanted to do more things with my ""Smart"" plugs. I wanted things like a geo-fence, so my lights and stereo would come on when I arrive home, allowing me to walk into a welcoming home. What I discovered is that without a hub or IFTTT, this is impossible right now. So I looked into hubs, only to discover that the TP-Link products do not work with ANY hub! I was shocked. For such a great product to be incompatible with any popular hub on the market is inconceivable to me. The same story with IFTTT. So as much as I enjoy my 5 TP-Link Plugs, I may have to replace them to achieve a better smart home. CAVEAT EMPTOR!. I have written the company asking for them to upgrade the firmware to be HUB compatible. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have only had this for a few weeks, but I absolutely love it. I currently have two of these and I am looking to buy more. This is incredibly easy to set up using the Kasa app on your phone. Once you've accomplished that, the next step is connecting it to Amazon Echo, which is just as easy. Just open Echo's app on your phone, tap on ""Smart home"", then ""Discover"", and you're off to the races! The final step is to create a group in the Amazon echo app so that you turn multiple items on or off. I only wish it could change the channel on my TV! LOL. This is a definite recommended product to anyone, and if you have Amazon echo it's a no-brainer. Especially since no ""hub"" is required for it to work with Echo.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
A Great Beginning to an Automated Home,4.0 ,"I just bought one of these TP-LINK Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa, Contorl your Devices from Anywhere (HS100) as a test run on the Christmas Tree (yes its already up and it's only November 9th... we're a little obsessed with Christmas) and it is working exactly as advertised. I probably spent about 5 minutes creating the initial hook to our WiFi with my iPhone 7 and then it was smooth sailing after downloading the Kasa App through the Alexa App and creating a group. The kids are loving it since they are all saying ""Alexa, turn on Christmas Tree"" every 5 minutes... needless to say the tree is getting quite a workout. The Kasa App is pretty good, I like the scheduling feature although only used it for one day but it seems to be working fine. For fun, I just freaked out my wife by turning the tree on and off while I am at work via the Kasa app on my phone, petty cool/fun if you ask me. Overall I'm happy with it, too early for 5 stars, but a solid 4 for a newbie to the whole Smart Home thing. Going to get 4 more of these for other decorations throughout the house and then put them all into a single group that Alexa can turn on and off. The kids should love that!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Good way to setup the home automation,5.0 ,"Received on time with no issues. It's little bulky as it obstructs the second socket. But it's reliable and I like it. Setting up takes little more than the ISELECTOR. I was able to install one in about 7 minutes. It's also expensive than ISELECTOR. However, it's a trusted name so I chose to buy this one. I bought second time also. I have 6 of these and 2 of ISELECTOR. all are working fine without any issue. This one is easy to setup with the APP (I have iPhone) and easy to setup with ALEXA by setting up the skills. Except it's expensive and well known company, I don't see much difference so far between TPLINK and ISECTOR. I didn't have to use the customer service so I can't compare that aspect.

"Remote connection should work, but it doesn't",4.0 ,"* Edit: updated to add extra stars because TP-Link support has been very helpful and I resolved the issue with them I've had the same exact problem as Tom happen with mine, it consistently drops off the network. See Tom's comment on the link below: http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-Amazon-Electronics-Anywhere-HS100/product-reviews/B0178IC734/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&showViewpoints=0 I can watch it on the Kasa app, it will drop off from availability in Kasa something like 70% of the time I'm looking at it. Going to try to reinstall the Kasa app like customer support has suggested, but if this doesn't work I'd really like to get this working instead of returning it and waiting for another. Here is my situation: - Smart Plug is connected to my 2.4GHz connection. - SSID is hidden but I got Kasa to connect by temporarily showing the network SSID, connecting, then re-hiding the SSID. - This connection is secured by WPA2-AES and is using 802.11 b, g, and n protocols (all of which are supposedly supported by the HS100). - DHCP has more than enough IP address allocation for this device to join the network. - HS100 is plugged in directly below the shelf where the router sits. This means it is about a foot away from the router and rules out any chance that ""out of range"" errors are valid. Possible issues: - If any ports need to be opened to allow this traffic through the router, I have not been informed about them (there shouldn't be anyway). - Are the TP-Link servers experiencing connectivity issues on their end? If the plug is unable to reach them because their servers are having problems, that would explain why I keep seeing ""Local only"" when I want to use the Remote services. - The app seems to be not quite 100% polished, could there be some flawed logic in it? I did notice a spelling mistake of ""youre"" instead of ""you're"", are there other things that need to be fixed in the app? I will continue working with customer support on this, and will change my review if we get it working.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

A great device.,5.0 ,"The unit arrived and is doing it job for me. The setup took me about 20 minutes which included downloading an app to an Iphone and signing up for some type of online account + hooking it to my Amazon Echo and testing that, and finally programming the device to control a lamp on a schedule. It works.. The directions were OK. I would recommend reading them completely first and then starting out. I did not and was confused once or twice but it all worked out. Pros: - Amazon Echo control - Phone app control - scheduling feature - fairly easy setup - I like the ability to turn on/off using the sunset/sunrise feature or a specific time. Wish list/Cons: - Wish it was a little thinner for use behind furniture - Wish you could use a PC for controlling and programming instead of just the app - Wish it worked with Windows Phone too - And this is my biggest negative: I wish that during programming for the schedule that I could set an on time based on the sunset time with an offest. For instance, I would like the lamp to turn on 30 minutes prior to the sunset time. So far, I cannot find this feature and it turns on only at sunset. - I hope this device/app will be upgradeable in the future to add more functionality.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

The functions of being able to have it turn off or on at sunrise or sunset makes it much easier than having to reset a normal timer.

I probably won't buy more of these unless I need them for lamps that are not going to be part of a scene that needs another trigger besides sunset/sunrise It does NOT have a time offset. For example, it gets darker before sunset depending on the location of the outlet in your house or the weather conditions. However, you can only set it to turn on at sunset and not 20 minutes before sunset, for example. For my outdoor lights and another interior light on toggle switches, I use Honeywell timers that are installed in place of the toggle switches.

Like buttah connecting the TP-Link with Amazon Echo!!!,5.0 ,"Oh my god, it was like buttah! setting the TP-Link up with the Amazon Echo. Thank you so much TP-Link Support for responding to another persons review, because that made me more inclined to purchase this! I along with my mother - who is on the other side of Texas - have been having weird problems with the Wemo plug and Echo, where it only works when it wants to. The times you need the Wemo, it wouldn't work and I would have to go into the Alex app and have to discover the Wemo plug again - it wouldn't be discovered if I simply asked Alexa to do it. Seems that that lots of people started having this problem starting @ 4-6 weeks ago. So the TP-Link was at the top of my list, but I didn't know if it worked with the Amazon Echo. After seeing a reply from TP-Link support regarding the echo and saying it now works, I thought I would give it a try. I set up the TP-Link Kasa for iPhone on my iPad, signed up, followed instructions, and the app itself was breeze - especially compared to the Wemo app. Remeber, you have to start in the TP-Link Kasa app and be signed in. Follow instructions. When it tells you to leave the app, that means that you then go to your settings for wifi and then select the TP-Link device as your wifi. Then, go back to the TP-Link Kasa app to finish. After you are done in the Kasa app, go into the Alexa app. In the Alexa App, go to the menu and select Smart Home, then go to Device Links - find and select ""Link with TP-Link Kasa. This will bring up a menu where you put in your TP-Link Kasa email & password. When you are done with that, go back to Smart Home in the Alexa app, then Devices, where you will then select ""Discover Devices.""

Pretty good for home automation,4.0 ,"My home office is adjacent to our bedroom. When I go to work in the wee hours, if I flip on the overhead light, it invariably wakes my wife up. With this, I have a lamp behind my desk that I can turn on remotely, that give me enough light to enter the office and close the door, without disturbing the sleeping beauty. It was very easy to set up. One caveat: It requires a 2.4GHz network. One of my routers supports both 2,4 and 5GHz so I have a mixed network, which means I can access the lamp seamlessly no matter what router my phone connects to. The Kasa app is helpful and easy to use, but I wish it was integrated with HomeKit and Siri as it is with Alexa. I also wish it had an internal web interface so I could also control it by logging in to my computer (in my case, not a great need for this but it would be fun). You can create an account and log in to their web service to control the lamp remotely, but I am leery of this type of service, just because it is one piece of the security puzzle that is out of my hands.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Simple product that is fantastic at what it does,5.0 ,"I was very impressed with this product. I have written very few reviews of products but I felt compelled to relate my experience. Setup was incredibly easy. Download the app, go through the very simple instructions there. 15 minutes after opening the box it was working perfectly. I used the timer feature several times and it worked great. I have it set to turn on every weeknight at the same time, and so far (last night), that worked as well. I love that it stores all schedules, network information, and away mode setup directly on the device, so even if the app is not running, or you even move the plug to a different outlet, all your settings will be maintained. Away mode lets you set up certain times (including the possibility of sunset to sunrise or vice versa) where the plug will turn on and off randomly, so if a light (or TV) is attached to the plug and it is visible from a window, it will look like someone is home. Haven't used this yet, but it looks like a great feature. I just set this up yesterday, so I don't have a lot of experience with it yet, but so far it has worked perfectly. The only downsides I have found so far, is that the plug is a little bulky, although its not really a problem (If you have it plugged into the top plug in a normal 2 plug outlet, it won't block the bottom plug). Also, if you are trying to trigger the plug from the app while you are not on the same network as the plug, it might take as long as 10 seconds the very first time. Every subsequent press of the power button will be nearly instantaneous. If you are connected to the same network, there are no delays.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Was going to return, but gave it one more chance - glad I did that!",4.0 ,"I bought this since I liked the idea of automating my home using the existing Wi-Fi network without the need to set up some expensive hub or system. We did not start out on the right foot, however. The electronic outlets in my apartment are placed two in a row, i.e. horizontally instead of vertically - the Smart Plug is so bulky that I can only use one Smart Plug per plate, and I can only squeeze in a smaller plug for the second outlet. Not great at all, particularly since I am already using outlet taps to maximize the number of electric equipment I can use for each outlet. I ended up using these Smart Plugs on extension cords to get around the issue. Another problem I then have is that the Smart Plugs cannot connect to hidden networks. I have one known (password protected) network, and a second hidden network. The hidden network is intended for my equipment, whereas the known network is for friends and visitors. I have to use the known network for the Smart Plugs, and put my phone onto the known network as well for this to work. I can live with it, but not cool. Having said that, once I got past these issues (and I actually started a return before I decided to try it one more time), the Smart Plugs are great. I like the fact that I can switch on a number of lights at once that I would otherwise have to switch on individually. I also like the fact that I can set this to a schedule especially when I am traveling.

There's a lot of potential in this and overall, I'm glad I got these!

It has been nice to have the ability to turn on and off lamps lights with this products. It helps prepare things for when I get home and I need a light on cause it is so dark. The app that comes with it is very simple and easy to use and you can set up rooms as you would like. The only thing I wish it could do is the ability to connect to 5Ghz wifi router.

Great Device,4.0 ,"I bought two of these to turn on my Christmas tree and front window Christmas lights using my Amazon Echo. Every day my wife would say, ""Honey, turn on the Christmas lights."" Now all I have to do is say, ""Alexa, turn on Christmas."" No more going from room to room and bending over to turn on switches. After Christmas, I still use them in my den to turn the lights on and off. I would give it five stars except for two things: one, this thing is bulky and blocks the second outlet; and two, there was a bug in the Android version of their software that prevented me from adding them to my open network (I use MAC filtering). There was no bug in the Apple version of the software so I used my wife's iPhone set them up. In addition to the devices now working flawlessly, I must compliment their tech support. They were the ones who pointed out the bug in the software and steered me to the Apple software instead. They were superb. I would certainly consider purchasing more when they're on sale.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

"Beautiful, reliable, recommended",5.0 ,"Most reliable Wi-Fi switch I've found. The app is a teensy bit flakey during setup like all the other apps out there but still more stable and reliable than anything else I've tried (like the WeMo switches). The problem of it hogging the entire outlet has been removed in the latest version which is even better. Once it's set up, it works like a charm. I use it with our Google Home for lights and to turn on our coffee pot in the morning from bed and it never fails. I've also scheduled it to go on and off in Away mode and it retains the schedule even if you unplug and replug it or turn off the Wi-Fi - very nice!

Works flawlessly with Amazon Echo,5.0 ,"I picked this Smart Plug up when it was on sale for about $20. I had been wanting to get one to pair with my Amazon Echo so I can turn my lights on by simply saying ""Alexa, lights on."" It's actually pretty awesome and is a definite cool factor. One thing I'm very happy about is the Android app to control this. It's called ""TP Link Kasa."" I've had a few bad experiences with apps to control smart devices and I'm happy to say that this device has a well made app. It was pretty simple to set this app up with the Amazon Echo . You start off by adding the Kasa skill to the Alexa app by opening the Alexa app, going to skills, click add, and searching for and adding the Kasa skill. From there you have to get the ""TP Link Kasa"" app from Google play or the iOS app store. Once you open that app it will guide you through the process of connecting the Smart Plug to your Kasa app. Once those are connected Alexa should be able to control the Smart Plug.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

"Great product, great Technical Support team",5.0 ,"Ordered two in anticipation of my Dot arriving after. One worked flawlessly (controlling my bed-side lamp), and the other was very fickle (controlling my stereo). I called Customer Support and a human who spoke American picked up (no press ""1"" for whatever). He was confused since he says they rarely get calls about this model (HS-100). After about 5 min of deliberation he asked if it was hooked up to a surge protector. Turns out it was an RFI issue, so I moved it away from the surge protector, and now I have two flawlessly working Smart-Plugs. P.S. Alexa keeps trying to play her own music when I say ""Echo, turn on the radio"", so I had to rename it ""Stereo"", but that is an issue with Alexa, not this product.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Only slight drawback is that this is large and will block access to the other receptical in outlet box. I have three of these now and will likely be adding more. All show up in list in the app for quick and easy identification of status, schedules and timers. Couple ideas for these beyond simple items such as lights... - Window Fans. Set schedules to turn on/off when trying to cool/warm house - Modem/Router Reset. Frequently need to reset these that may be on another floor? Open app and reset in seconds. - Turntables. Newer higher end turntables often don't have auto return. If you forget to pull tonearm off record it will spin endlessly.

Love them -- some rough edges though.,4.0 ,"I've had five HS100's working for over a month now. They work great, including good control via Echo. I almost returned them because after a power outage two of them stopped working and I eventually realized none of them could be installed properly for remote control. However I believe the problem was my inept setup of ARP MAC-IP binding in my (TP-Link) router. I don't believe I even benefit from ARP binding in my setup. Anyway I disabled it and now installation/setup goes smoothly for all five devices. I would rate this five stars except for: (1) The Kasa app runs only on iOS and android phones or tablets. There are no versions for PC or web browser, and (2) the instructions and documentation need to be improved. Also, a support rep kept telling me Kasa was intended only for iOS phones, not for my iOS tablet, although the Amazon web pages clearly say otherwise. And the app does work OK on my iPad although it has to be installed from the App Store as an iPhone-only app. The user interface isn't perfect on the iPad -- when setting up a schedule the day-of-the-week buttons show only the top one-third of the button. But you can tap on that small part and they work. So far I love these devices, in spite of the rough edges mentioned.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Simple app that loads quicker than wemo's. can toggle on/off if you want remote access (outside of your wifi) through the app on a plug-per-plug basis. I'm assuming most of the more negative reviews were people upset about it saying it worked with alexa. in the past, apparently you needed to launch a separate skill every time you wanted to ask for a plug action. this is no longer the case. they are found and controlled directly by alexa without any problems so far. if youre into monitoring, the power consumption monitoring one seems nifty. i went with basic plugs when they were on sale because i simply wanted the automation.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Quick set up. Works perfectly through the app and/or Amazon Echo. Great value.,5.0 ,"Easy set up with Amazon Echo and my iPhone. I imagine the small number of people having issues with the device might be setting it up improperly, or not reading the instructions carefully. It took me about 5 minutes to set up and get working both from my phone and from Amazon Echo. To set this up you need to download the Tp-Link Kasa app on your phone or tablet. Then create a login (have the same password for all my home automation devices so don't have to bother remembering a bunch). Remember to connect the plug to your 2.4ghz band internet if you have a dual band router (most modern routers are dual band). Don't worry, even though 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands appear as two different selectable wifis from your settings, devices connected to either one can STILL talk to each other. Anyways, installed and logged into KASA and followed their simple instructions for setting up the plug. Then I logged into the Alexa app and when to the Smart Home menu and selected to connect to my new Kasa acct. From there I clicked ""discover"" devices and it found the smart plug and let me name it. Named it ""Lamp"" and told Alexa to turn on the lamp. With almost no delay it turned on and off the lamp. Also, nice to turn on the lamp from the Kasa app and give our network camera better visibility so I can make sure the cats haven't shut themselves in the bathroom again. ***VERY EASY, just read through the instructions SLOWLY if you are somewhat new to network connected devices.****","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Love these plugs with Alexa!,5.0 ,"We had several Wemo smart plugs but tried these due to the significant price difference at the time. I can best compare to the Wemo, as that's my reference point, but these TP-Link plugs are fantastic. At the time I purchased three of these, they were about 1/2 the price of the Wemo plugs (I see they are now selling for about the same price). So price aside, I think these plugs are better than the Wemo plugs (which I also really like ) for two main reasons. I use both plugs with my Echo and other Alexa products and they work flawlessly. I did find the TP-Link plugs connected to my Wifi and went through setup much easier than Wemo. I struggled with each of my Wemo switches to get them connected, but these plugs connected better. I believe that is due to the TP -Link plug having a much better app installation process. Both plugs are natively integrated into Alexa, so you don't need to communicate through a skill (though you do still need to activate the skill in the Akexa app). The whole family loves using Alexa to turn on lamps, fans, electric fireplace, air conditioners, etc. These are great and the best part is they are stand alone plugs... you don't need a hub like so many other smart products. You simply buy as many or as little plugs as you need. I am very impressed.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
A++++,5.0 ,"I love this outlet! So much so that I came back for 2 more (if only I had enough self control to hold out for the sale price but oh well, still worth it). Super simple set up, plug it in, install the Kasa app on my iPhone, click the icon of the plug, click thru the screens, go to my settings app on my phone to allow the WIFI, add my wifi password (which I had to go find), and go back to the KASA app to finish the registration and give this little outlet its name. I hereby name you ""Living room lamp"", with ""Christmas tree"" too soon follow as one of the additional outlets that I've since purchased. I can control the outlets using Alexa. Alexa, turn off the Christmas tree. Or I can just open the Kasa app on my phone and turn it on or off from there. I can create a schedule to turn off every night at 10pm. I can create a schedule to turn on the light every morning at 6am. It's great! I'm new to 'smart homes' so if you are as well, this is a great first step to combine with your echo and/or echo dot.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
the fact that you can turn things on and off from your phone is awesome. I purchased one for mom,5.0 ,"I originally purchased this for my AC, but my AC turns off when power is disconnected, so it doesn't work. HOWEVER, I have a Breville espresso maker that doesn't have an automatic shutoff. These little devices work perfectly, because I have it auto shut off every three hours, therefore, it will never be left on. Also, the fact that you can turn things on and off from your phone is awesome. I purchased one for mom, because she's always questioning whether she left the iron on. Now, all she has to do is open her phone, and voila, can check and turn it off while away from the house.

What nice pieces of hardware,5.0 ,"Wow! What nice pieces of hardware. Bought two of these. Had two WEMO switches ordered but after reading the reviews, and then comparing those reviews to the reviews on the TP-LINK Smart Plugs, I change to the TP-LINK, and I'm glad I did. So far, they are working perfectly with my Amazon Echo. I'm optimistically cautious however on their longevity. I don't like having to create an account with the TP-LINK's Kasa cloud in order to use these but it seems to work very well. Time will be the judge. I recommend new buyers read some of the reviews that have detailed explanations on setup and follow that to the letter. That's what I did. I installed these two switches up in a matter of minutes and they work exactly as advertised. I couldn't be more pleased.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Good-bye WeMo,5.0 ,"So far so good. MUCH easier to set up than the WeMo. The TP link setup is pretty much automatic, unlike the wemo. You don't even have to switch your mobile device wifi to the unit, this is all done automatically. My only hiccup was the device was not located on the first try, but the app alerts on this, gives you an option to try again, and the unit was immediately found. Everything else was completely flawless. Yeah, if you want remote access outside of your network you need to create an ID, but that was no big deal. Unlike the wemo app, everything on the TP app is easily accessed, and NOT laggy! So far, I'm happy with the switch (plus the $20 sale price from amazon makes this unit about 1/2 of what I paid for the wemo).","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Works well but Echo Dot setup a bit complicated.,4.0 ,"I purchased the TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug from Amazon and paid $19.99. This was my first step into home automation and a bit of an experiment to see if it would be helpful to me. Right now, I use the Smart Plug to power on and off a lamp in my bedroom, and I control it with the kasa app on my Android phone and with an Echo Dot. Overall the device works extremely well--both with the kasa app and the Echo Dot. A few miscellaneous notes: * Setting up the Smart Plug to work with my Echo Dot was a little complicated (at least for me), but, once set up, it has worked flawlessly. I will primarily use the Echo Dot to control the Smart Plug but I like having the ability to use the Kasa app when I find that more convenient. * The kasa app is easy to use and has many helpful device management and scheduling features. * The Smart Plug only supports the 2.4GHz WiFi band, and I thought I would have to switch my phone to that frequency. This hasn't been the case. * The maximum power rating is 1.8KW, which is enough to allow me to use it with a moderately-sized Lasko floor heater. I'm waiting for the Smart Plug to go on sale again so I can purchase one for this use. Anyways, because of the somewhat complicated setup with my Echo Dot, I've given the Smart Plug 4 stars rather than 5.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

A very happy consumer (for now...!),5.0 ,"It's almost too good to be true and I'm nervous about giving it 5 stars the day after I installed it... I don't want to jinx the amazingness of this product! But so far, it is seriously amazing. Yes the plug is too big to share an outlet but I used a power strip and plugged it into that so as to not take up precious outlet space. It was very easy to set up - first you download the app and then it takes you step by step through the process. At the end of the process I plugged my dining room lamp into it and voila! Let there be light! I was suddenly controlling the dining room lamp from the other room with the remote control on the app. So easy. Then I connected it to Alexa (Amazon Echo) and that was very easy too. There is a link on the app to show you how to connect it. I even got to play a little joke on my unsuspecting boyfriend later that night by asking him to turn off the light and then using the remote control from the other room to turn it off before he touched the switch. I highly suggest this game, it can give you a good 15 minutes of fun.

Maddening!!! (Better now),4.0 ,"Don't get me wrong, I have always liked TP Link products, so I bought this over Wemo. HUGE mistake! I have been trying since yesterday to get the Smart Plug 100 connected to my network and my Echo. Either the Kasa software hangs up on my Samsung G4 or it can't find the plug (5 feet away). Getting it onto the network is another nightmare even though I have two routers. Just keep getting the message that network setup failed:null. I have found that the TP Link website is also of little use in trying to resolve the issue. Amazon says it cannot be returned unless damaged or unopened but will try to send it back and see what happens and then order a Wemo. Won't buy TP Link again without a serious think. UPDATE: After 6 attempts, I FINALLY got it to work, but still not sure I will order another TP Link, but hate to think about going through another setup process with another manufacturer. 2ND UPDATE: After a few days of use, I can say that this product works as promised, but admit initial set up was problematic, even for a tech savy person. HOWEVER, I am pleased with how this product works so have change my review from 1 star to 4. I think it would be in TP Link's best interest to include better instructions for set up so others won't have to go through what I did.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Perfect!,5.0 ,"I didn't realize but this outlet does not require a hub to connect to Alexa or phones. The outlets connect directly to your wifi network. Setup REQUIRES the download of the Kasa app on your phone. After downloading the app just follow the simple on screen instructions to connect the outlet to your home wifi network. After your outlet is setup and you are able to control it from Kasa, tell Alexa to discover new devices and she should find them quickly. Also available after setup with the Kasa app is Alexa/Echo compatibility. Ask her to find devices and Alexa found all 5 of my plugs with no issues and controls them via the name you assign in the Kasa app. The Kasa app is actually very good. It allows you to very easilly control the outlets from anywhere in the world with your phone, very easy setup and it works very well. It also allows the setup of daily schedules, timers, and an away mode which can make your house look lived in. The only small issue I have is that the device is larger than it looks and slightly blocks the lower outlet. Some things can still fit but larger plugs will not.

I need to unplug the TP-Link Plug and plug it back in whereupon everything seems to reinitialize and work properly again.

Very happy with the TP-Link Smart Plug,5.0 ,"Very happy with the TP-Link Smart Plug. The set up is fairly easy and allows for mistakes by simply pressing a reset button and or rewriting a command word or title on your phone ,tablet, or PC. The size of the plug is on the large side, but well worth the lost space on the electric outlet.because I use multiple plugs, I found it wise not to try setting up all plugs in the same room.

"HS100 - Nicely done, meets all expectations.",5.0 ,"I bought four of these when they were on sale recently for $22.99. I am totally pleased. Their Wi-Fi reception is very good, even in the areas farthest from my router. Their integration with Amazon Echo is so thorough, all I have to say is ""Alexa, living room on"" for example. The only improvement I would make is to shrink them, especially in width. Style points don't count. Later: I now have schedules set up for two of the smart plugs. Easy to program. I especially like the inclusion of the ""at Sunset"" option. I have already thought of more applications and will be buying more. Still later: I am now up to 10 HS100 smart plugs installed, and still coming up with more applications. Still later: I love these TP-link smart plugs, I have ten of them installed now. I also really like the TP-Link wire-line network extenders - five of them installed. But BEWARE, they don't play well together. Don't place a wire-line extender behind a smart plug. The smart plug messes up the network signal. I thought my laptop ethernet port had failed until I figured this out by accident while testing a new device.

I am highly disappointed. It only truly works by using the app and turning it on by that method. Amazon needs to get their act together when it comes to Alexa and her counterparts. Many things do not work correctly with Alexa one needs to be too precise in the exact wording in order to get her to cooperate. This can be very frustrating. She should respond to a keyword or two without having to recite a phrase verbatim in order for her to respond. My brother has the Google Home and we compared the two side-by-side.

And despite coming with a lot of information for troubleshooting, none of it was very effective, not even phone tech support. However, I figured it out myself and hopefully this will save other people aggravation: when you open the Kasa app to register the device, do not skip creating an account (even though it offers that as an option) as you need to have an account ""in the cloud"" to operate this device. And when you open the Alexa app to pair the device once you are done linking the device to your Wi-Fi etc., don't select ""find devices"" --which seems to make sense--but instead, ""get more Smart home skills"" and then search for Kasa and follow the directions from there to pair the device to Alexa.

Without a robust wifi connection, the unit provides no value. I initially also had problems getting the unit to work reliably with my home wifi network. It would repeatably drop the wifi connection. So I tested the unit at another place in the house, where it was in closer proximity to an access point. When it worked flawlessly at that location and didn't drop the connection, I realized that the problem was with my network, not the Smart Plug. I tweaked my network in the original location, and now the Smart Plug works perfectly there. I came very close to returning this item in frustration, but I'm glad that I instead investigated and then improved my wifi connectivity at the point of use for this device.

Not Quite Ready for Primetime,2.0 ,"The TP-Link smart plug is an interesting product, but is plagued by inconsistent response when attempting to control it via mobile app and/or Amazon's Alexa. Its integration and set-up are straightforward enough. Simply follow the instructions and you will have your smart plug up and running in 5 - 10 minutes. Initially, this has a bit of a neat factor when you first activate your outlet using your voice. However, every once in awhile the product simply does not respond, whether it is through the mobile app called Kasa or via Alexa. The problems with controls occur approximately 2-3 times a week. After some testing, I believe it is due to the product itself, because the internet connection is stable, Alexa still works with other commands, and I have tested 3 different units of these. So while having a smart plug is neat and is useful, the inconsistent control makes it more of a hassle than a help.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

But when the Christmas lights come down, I'll use it to rename for a new location. We have two plugs and two of the smart lightbulbs by TP-Link. When using with Echo, make sure to name them sufficiently different names so Echo can easily distinguish them. There's also support for groups (e.g. Living Room which might control several devices).

I simply haven't identified an function that it performs that I can't do/ haven't done with a wall timer plugged into the socket. Yes, you can link to it remotely to turn the connected device on/off, but that doesn't have much value to me. It is cool to be able to tell Echo to tour a light on and off, but so what? I'm going to keep fiddling around and perhaps I'll find a higher use. I suspect that over time, after prices have dropped, I'll get a few more to use as light timers.

Oh wait instead of getting up to turn something off I will jump from my preferred iPhone Network (5ghz) cause its f a s t e r - and skip over to the 2.4ghz and to make sitting on my butt for 4 minutes monkeying around with these plugs my preference over getting up! One solution is to find the brand of old school A/C on and off plug adapters here on Amazon (best seller starting with 'E') with the simple white remote with number 1-5. Guess what when you kill power to them - #1 they kill the nominal drain to your appliance super well and #2 I read they had a 100' line of sight range.... But it wasn't until I purchased it that I realized they are low cost RF Remotes. That means radio-frequency - or don't have to point like a sharpshooter or worry if the plug adapter is 'low on your wall' or behind a piece of furniture - imagine that! Basically if you are in the largest room (and beyond) of your home and the plug is hidden - no problem! Further the plugs (bought the 5 plug adapter kit for $29 here - yes (5) of them for the cost of one TP-Link - and some person whose actually done customer service actually printed numbers 1-5 on them and the small convenient remote (they gave 2 with purchase) has one vertical row 1-5 for ON and beside it one vertical row of OFF numbered 1-5. No configuring - no jumping wifi networks - and no muttering four letter words to yourself because you're gonna have to sit through the TP-Link app wizard or find your phone to reconfigure these. If you've read this far - I'm amazed - so for you - YES they are Amazon Echo Compatible - oh joy! got me with that too - in for three of them for about $100. So when you're sitting there repeating the name of the device to Echo or you hear it tell you one more time that 'I can't find the device 'wrong name that Echo reiterates like it need to spell or have Ivy League Phonetics' on Adam's Network' or 'Sorry I'm having trouble right now, what is the name of the device you're looking for' - and ps - Echo was still at volume 8 - because its best as your alarm clock - or you're scrambling for another remote so Echo can understand you which interrupts your game or movie'. Ugggggh - honestly I'm writing this narrative to save you the pain of spending your money to have these oversized disasters not work consistently or easily. PS - its' not joy to maybe find a 2nd plug that can squeeze to the point of breaking something just to share a 2-outlet space for this near baseball sized adapter. If it's not ungrounded (2-prong) or takes any liberties deviating from the smallest footprint possible - this big guy is the only thing that your 2-outlet space is gonna host! I've wasted 15 minute chunks regularly over a few months before I spent $29 bucks for the 5 adapter 'E'-brand with 100' radio frequency remote with zero programming, zero wifi and zero BS....... I submit this knowing I sound like a serious hater - but I know that some Amazonions' will thank me!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Each device needs the setup process from the beginning,5.0 ,"Works well, does its job. If you want to configure a second device to control the plug (for example two smart phones to turn on or off the same light), you need to go through the configuration process from the start with each one. That means for the second phone, you will need to hit the RESET button on the device and go through the configuration process again. The second phone even though it is on the same network will not recognize the device as being configured. Once done both phones will find the device.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"After a little effort, works great!",3.0 ,"The HS100 works very well, once you get it set up. Check the TP-LINK user forum to see some of the problems. I had to call TP-LINK customer service to find out that I needed to update the firmware on my plug before I could enable remote control. They were very helpful. They emailed the instructions needed to do the upgrade and, after installing it, the plug works as advertised. I'm just saying, it didn't work right out of the box. On another note, as I said, it works great at home, but it doesn't work if your WiFi is not secured (open). In many of the condo's that I rent for extended periods, they do NOT have secure networks. So leave you Smart Plug at home. The only place where this is talked about is in reviews like this one! BTW, I've had this plug since early December, 2016. Still, I'd buy another one.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"""Smart"" Smart Plug",4.0 ,"I liked the idea of being able to control plugs thru the Echo. I placed this one on the living room lamp, so I can turn on the lights immediately at night when I am returning from 2nd job. It works perfectly as described once it is paired with the Echo. Gave it 4 stars because the setup was not user friendly and took way too much time to pair. You have to toggle back and forth between the Kasa and Alexa apps and there is preparation with Kasa before you can even begin to pair. You must set up a cloud based Kasa account, name the device, and set the remote before pairing. Instructions with the device would have been appreciated rather than searching in apps and going online to Kasa and Amazon to figure it out. The setup aside, the device itself works great and will eventually purchase an additional one for bedroom.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Insecure, but that can be helpful if you know what you are doing.",3.0 ,"Works very well, decent range. Mobile app is decent (iOS), but could use some more options. For better or worse, depending on how you look at it, the command protocol is completely insecure, so you can script it on your own (https://georgovassilis.blogspot.com/2016/05/controlling-tp-link-hs100-wi-fi-smart.html). With that said, the first thing I did, even before plugging it in, was add a firewall rule on my router blocking its MAC from the internet. Thus, I can't comment on its remote access capabilities. I'd recommended for all sorts of fun setups, albeit with fairly poor security. In my case, I used it to turn on some lamps in the morning as a de facto alarm clock. With the hacked script, I then took it one step further and had it blink the lights (you can't do this with the app since the programming has a 1 minute granularity).","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Great for the price, even at full price.",5.0 ,"I already have Wemo plugs...wemo bulbs and philips bulbs. Just got 3 of these and they are a nice addition to the set-up. The wemo app has become so unreliable that I can no longer control the plugs from it away from home and have to use the DO app to control them. I set up the TP smart plugs in about 10 minutes and the apps works from my phone's wi-fi and set-up with Amazon Echo was easy too. I'd recommend this, especially at the sale price of $22.95 (I think they are $29.95 right now). I now have around 30 connected devices at home, 2 Echo's and 2 Echo Dots.

Set-up not easy for low tech person,4.0 ,"After many attempts and a long phone call with TP-Link customer service, I found out that you have to download the required app with a smart phone (which I do not have). I had been trying to download the app on my ipad with no success. The customer service person told me I would not be able to use the smart plug without a smartphone. At the end of our conversation, I asked if I could use someone else's smart phone to set up my smart plug, and he said that could work. So my daughter set it up with her smartphone. Now that it is set up, we are enjoying using the plug to turn on and off our bedroom light without getting out of bed.

GREAT SO FAR,5.0 ,"Hesitant to buy based on other negative reviews. Then I realized they were propably written by people who have limited grasps on technology. Picked up one of these for $20 on Prime day and set it up in minutes after receiving it. The app is super simple and commands sent from the app are received by the plugs in the blink of an eye. Satisfied with the functionality i went to order more, but Amazon had raised the price back to $30 so I had no choice but to buy them from Newegg, who had them on sale for $15.

Not a really 'smart' plug,2.0 ,"I am pretty disappointed with this plug. I ordered 2, one for each of my kids' rooms because they are supposed to work with our Echo, Tap and Echo Dot. One of the kids' rooms works fine - I would've rated them 4 stars at least if they'd both worked right. The problem is with the other one I got. It can never keep a stable connection to my router which is built to handle 4K streaming. If it can handle that, it can handle his little plug, or so I thought. The Kasa app is minimally useful at best. When I open the app, it keeps telling me that the problematic device isn't associated with my Kasa account despite me having to log in to even connect the devices. I've done the setup on this thing at least 4 times now and nothing. Bottom line - save your money and buy a WeMo. There's a reason the TP-Links are cheaper - when it comes to SmartHome tech, you definitely get what you pay for. I've already ordered WeMos to replace the TP-Links.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

The only caveat is that you have to be home,4.0 ,"I use them for lamps and they work as shown, but I (for some reason) thought you could control them away from home.

Well made and a bit buggy,4.0 ,"April 3 Update. Seldom do I give up. So, after I wrote this review I: - deleted the Kasa App - reset each of my three Smart Plugs to Factory - power on reset of my iphone (6s) - install Kasa App - set up each smart plug per guided instructions - power on reset my iphone And...yes. The Away function works for all three plugs now! The sunrise/sunset still doesn't but that's a documented item so it is a just a bit of discord in the documentation. I can also say that the Away function actually is working, lights are off and on in a good way. Upping a Star. These plugs come beautifully and wastefully packaged. They are very well made, and as attractive as a largish power plug can be. They do hog up outlet space, you can squeeze a three prong grounded plug into the open outlet, but it is right against the Smart Plug's bottom. The LED indicator lights are a nice, visible green but don't light up an entire room at night, good! Installation is easy, the Kasa app walks you thru the process and it worked fine for all three of the plugs I purchased. For me, there was an uncomfortable amount of time from when the installation was ""complete"" until the app came back and said things where ready to use, and the first time I tried to cycle each outlet, no communication. After that, immediate on and offs upon command. So good! Integration with the Amazon Echo is easy, and it works reliably and quickly. I named my Smart Plugs Lamp, Lamp 1, Lamp 2 and Alexa wouldn't cycle the plugs with those names, so I changed the names to simpler ones and it now works perfectly. OK, beyond that. The scheduled times, and the countdown timers work fine and are nice features. However, the Away function only ""starts"" on one of the plugs. Two of the plugs won't start Away, rather they say ""unknown error"". I deleted and reinstalled the Kasa app, I reset and reinstalled the plugs, same issue. It seems like the Kasa app won't support multiple Away settings on a single account? Other issue: there are instructions online to set up the Away function from Sunset to Sunrise, which would be a nice feature but it also does not work as the Away feature needs to be in the same day...you can't go dusk to dawn with the random Away function. Overall, a good product. It is newer and TP-Link is a good company, so I expect a few software upgrades and they'll work out the issues I've found so far. I would like to see TP-Link work with Amazon on Frustration Free eco-friendly packaging, really no reason to have as much plastic and paperboard go into protecting this product.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
"Very easy to set up, lots of opportunities for automation with Echo",4.0 ,"Update: I own both the regular and mini tp-link. Since my original review I've had much trouble keeping the mini tp-link connected to my network. I have a strong wifi signal in my apartment with no issues on anything else but for some reason I constantly find the mini tp-link offline. I have to dig behind my entertainment center (the reason I wanted automation and needed a small plug) and unplug it/ re-plug it in. It stays online a few days and then happens again. I'm guessing it has a smaller antenna maybe? Other than that it works great, but isn't htat the point of it? I might swap it around and try to move it to another location. Original review: Great and easy to set up with the Kasa app. Combined with Echo this makes home automation easy.

Works well after initial hiccup,4.0 ,"This plug is really bulky! It takes up over 2 of my outlet spaces so I had to get one of those adjustable adapters to accommodate this and my other electrical appliances. Initial startup worked great without any problems.

I tried calling their help line and although it says 24-hrs support, there's no one picking up the phone. Just tells you to leave a voicemail or to email them. I finally just tried pushing all the buttons I could and it reset and detected the wifi again. It's worked without any problems since.

This is a good product. Not a great one,4.0 ,"This is a good product. Not a great one, but it might become one. In my Echo home there are different devices for different applications. This fits in for sure. If you want to dim lights, go Lutron Caseta. Pricey, but perfect for wall switch or lamp control. If you need an auto-off timer, We Mo is the way to go. Hopefully TP-Link can add an auto-off timer to their app and be THE alternative to the We Mo switch. For everything else I think this will be just fine. Echo integration works great. I have 7 Lutron switches, 2 We Mo and now 1 TP-Link. I can see getting 3 or 4 more of these for controlling Christmas lights through the Echo as no one else is at this price point. If they add an auto-off timer like We Mo has I will change to 5 stars. The TP-Link has a timer, but unless I am not understanding how to use it you have to set it every time. With the We Mo you can make a rule that turns the outlet off after a given amount of time automatically, every time it is turned on.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

I found if you have no wifi due to an outage you also can still access these on your phone, locally. That's a benefit some competitors didn't have. Since these also do not need a hub set up is much easier, and you can get them one or two at a time as your budget allows until your house is the smartest house on the block.I find no real delay in response time and the added ability to control my own home without risking a fall from turning out the lights is worth my weight in gold","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

It wasn't that tough, but I could see a lot of people getting frustrated or overwhelmed with the process. As I said, it does work very well. The biggest problem we have is that Alexa sometimes misunderstands our command, replying ""Sorry, there's no Paul light (or Hall light) in Michael's devices"". This is obviously more a problem with our interaction with Alexa than anything to do with the smart plug, which always follows Alexa's command.

I live in an apartment and my room has no central lighting system, so I use this outlet and a splitter to turn on all of my lights in my room. The setup process is relatively easy. It's well written out within the app, so you should be able to easily figure it out. The process itself isn't as easy as it could be, but it was worth it. Additionally, the app that is used to control the outlet (from anywhere you have data) can be slightly slow to launch, so I recommend getting the app ready before you want to to the light on. I will be getting an echo soon, so with that I should be able to avoid this process.

Super convenient!,5.0 ,"I bought the TP-Link Smart Plug to use with industrial grade patio lights I installed. Before getting his item I either had to leave them plugged in all the time or constantly plug/unplug them. With the smart plug not only can I shut them off with the simple press of a button, but there is a smartphone app that allows me to control the power as well. You can also control it via Alexa. I can set a timer or turn on the lights manually as I'm pulling in my driveway. Not only providing convenience but safety! I have an older home, so I regret not buying a multi pack.

Was relatively easy to install and set up with my smart phone. I would have given higher rating but the Smart Plug is large. When plugged into the outlet, the Smart Plug interferes with accessing the second plug. Meaning, with the Smart Plug in the outlet there's no way to plug anything else in the outlet.

"SmartPlug, buggy software.. Echo integration +1 star.",3.0 ,"The smart plug was not easy to setup and install. It should have been though.. Software was easy to find and install, hardware functioned as expected but the software was buggy. After I selected my internal network the software goes into a loop and never recovers you have to hard exit the app. I gave up on it and walked away... Came back 5 minutes later and the hardware was working as expected. During the 5 minutes I was looking for the refund procedures on Amazon. The hardware itself is larger than it looks, and takes up an entire wall outlet and you definitely need the extenders to plug this unit in. Overall I'm happy with the hardware, disappointed with software, thrilled with the Alexa integration! 3 out of 5 stars? Yes, because at the end of the day it worked.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Work great. I'll be buying more.,5.0 ,"I have two of these now and I'll be getting more. I have an Amazon Echo and I've slowly been adding more smart plugs as I can afford them. These are fairly inexpensive which makes them appealing. I have another one, from another company, that is twice the price and I think these ones work as well, if not better. I have the two brands connected to two lamps in the living room. They are both in the same group so that when I ask for the living room lights to come on, they should come on at the same time. However, there is a slight lag in the more expensive smart plug. The only drawback to these plugs is the size. You can't get anything else plugged into the other socket. My workaround is a powerstrip and I've had no problems. I'll be adding more of these.

It's super convenient to save electricity when you're not home but have the ability to flick them on to make sure you arrive to a well lit home. Setup was super easy and literally took less than 5 minutes. The app is really intuitive and allows you to name and give an image to everything you've got plugged into a smart hub.

However I have found that putting the smart plug on a table lamp that is frequently turned ...,5.0 ,"The device, software app and Alexa integration all work perfectly. However I have found that putting the smart plug on a table lamp that is frequently turned on and off by hand can be problematic. If you have tuned the lamp off at switch on the lamp it will of course not come on when the smart plug tries to turn it on. The reverse is true if the smart plug has turned it off and you try to turn it on at the lamp. This forces you to control the lamp 100% through the app or through Alexa or bend down to the smart plug to push the manual switch which is not always convenient. As a result I have decided it is best applied to a lamp or device that you would not normally turn on by hand.

I love the smart wall switches,4.0 ,"I love the smart wall switches, have two of them. One for the porch/front lights, and one dedicated to my Christmas lights. I decided to add this smart plug to the Christmas tree in my front window as well. The smart plug works great, easy setup from linking to my home network to setting up the schedule. The one issue I have with it is it takes up two wall outlets. See the metal prongs that go into the wall outlet are towards the bottom of the smart plug, easy enough. However the housing of the smart plug is too large near the bottom to allow a normal sized electrical cord to be plugged into the other wall outlet. Looks to be less than 1/4"" of material that likely could have been elementary during the design/manufacturing process.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

I also group them in Alexa to a Home group and turn all of them on and off simultaneously. I love it so much that I just bought one for the office. The setup is pretty easy and I got all of them up and running in less than 15 minutes.

Now to turn on the lights we just say ""Alexa, turn on kitchen lights""....and on them go! Of course you can turn them off as well by saying ""Alexa, turn off kitchen lights"". We also set a timer so if someone leaves them on, they will go off automatically after a time. This device works well for us and did exactly what we wanted it to do. I'm sure we'll be purchasing a few more as we discover new places to use them.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Happy customer; would love to see price drop,5.0 ,"Easy setup. I didn't read the manual. Just plugged it in. They mentioned which app to install on the box, so I did. The app was easy to use and it took me 2 minutes to fully setup. I tested the plug and it worked the first time. Then I connected it to my Google home app, again easy setup (another 30 seconds). I tried telling Google home to switch on the light, and again worked the first time. I'm a happy customer. I would like to see the price drop more. If it does, I'll probably order more. Happy with just one for now. Don't have to get up and switch off my bedroom light at night anymore.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
As Advertised,5.0 ,"This smart plug is exactly what I was looking for to replace my old mechanical light timer, which was beginning to make a humming noise.

GREAT HELP,5.0 ,"I'm mobility challenged, so I thought I would try this device. I set it up, but couldn't get it to work through Alexa at first. I called support and the pleasantly sounding woman in support assisted me. I'm not sure what the problem was, because I THOUGHT I did all that she directed me to do. Whatever the problem it worked and now I turn on lights by just speaking to Alexa or using my app on my phone. Now I just tell Alexa without going to the far side of the room in the dark just to light the room. Since proper installment, life got a little easier.

... going to go on record as saying that I love these things,5.0 ,"I'm going to go on record as saying that I love these things. I've now purchased three of them and set them all up operating lamps throughout the house on various schedules. It's reassuring to know that there's the appearance of activity at home when we're out. Also, the little kid in me loves turning the lamps on and of as if by magic! This is a great game to play with the kids - they sing a magic song and the lamps magically turn on by themselves. They're absolutely thrilled and never tire of it and if that's not worth $25, then what is? We went on a trip back to Europe recently and I used these to remotely turn the lamps on and off while over 4,000 miles from home. I didn't need to, because I'd set them up on a schedule, but it was fun and, well, why not?","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

"Bulky, but Beneficial",4.0 ,"I got this plug to work with my Amazon Echo. I like this plug, and it is moderately easy to set up and pair with the Echo. The app walks you through the entire set up, which definitely helps. My only real gripe with it is that it is rather large and bulky. I only uses one outlet, however it is so larger that it covers part of the second outlet. For example, I have mine attached to the top outlet and it covers half of the second outlet below it. Overall, I am satisfied with this product, but I wish it was not so bulky.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Great devices with room for enhancements,4.0 ,"I love these! I'm giving it 4 stars for two main reasons. 1. If you create a sunset/sunrise schedule, it does not update with each day. I also could not get the sunset time to be consistent across my two outlets. 2. Not being able to turn all lights on/off with one action. Unless connected with Alexa, you must hit the power off icon for each outlet to control power for. I want to be able to ""turn off my house"" all at once. Ps.

The app is also pretty easy to use when I want to control them from outside my house or without using Alexa. I've had the plugs for a few months now and I'm very happy with my purchase.

You can also control it via smart phone and push the button turning it on/off at anytime from anywhere you have a cell phone signal.

Can take a while to configure if you have router Firewall settings very restrictive.,3.0 ,"Took awhile to figure out how to setup and configure with Alexa.

"Great, just large",4.0 ,"Easy setup, paired with Alexa, and works without hiccups. My only reason for 4 stars is its size, which likely doesn't vary much from the industry, but it was kind of difficult to find a place for it since it juts out from the wall over an inch, and with the plug it becomes even more so. My other concern is that it can cover the other outlet, which is just poor design in my opinion -- reshape the design and let me utilize both outlets!","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Amazing! I feel like Judy Jetson!!,5.0 ,"*I've had this less than one day so if it goes kaput I'll re-review* Oh my God I'm buying 10 more of these today!! A light I can turn on by app?! No more leaving a light on all day so I don't come home to a dark house. No more figuring out how those timer plugs with the push pins work. Now I can tap a button on my phone and the back porch is nice and bright when I get home. Amazing. Set up is a breeze. Download the Kasa app, plug in the outlet, and the app walks you through the whole thing. Honestly the hardest part was getting up to find my WiFi password. The app let's you turn the plug on and off with a tap, set up a schedule of times you want the plug running, or turn the plug on/off with a countdown timer.

Really pleasantly surprised by these. Reliable. Just works!,5.0 ,"Really impressed with this. Bought two of these and I wasn't really sure what to expect. I bought them so that I could program a couple lights in the house to kick on at a certain hour in case we don't make it home before the sun sets. Basically for the dogs so they weren't in a pitch dark house. And also the security of having some lights on in house rather than it being completely dark. I love the convenience of being able to set them on my phone and from anywhere. I also like that my wife can turn any of them on if she is coming home and doesn't want to enter a dark house/room.

It is just ok.,2.0 ,"I use this plug to control a camera that sometimes freezes and needs to be rebooted. The setup of this device wasn't as easy as I thought. My home network is a little complicated and I utilize Mac Address restrictions instead of security on my wireless. TP-Link didn't like that. SO having to change my network to accommodate proved to be a real pain. Secondly, this plug takes up a lot of space. Putting it on top of the duplex outlet left inference room for a bottom plug to be used. So the Smart plug has to be plugged in at an angle. I would have though R&D would have caught this issue in development. Lastly, the range isn't great. Don't plan on controlling anything at a decent distance.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Works smartly in my smart home project,5.0 ,"I have been super happy with the TP-Link Smart Plug. I bought three of these, and they are excellent. They were easy to setup, the app is easy to use, and the integrate perfectly with my Amazon Echo. By contrast, I also bought two more expensive Belkin WeMo switches. The WeMos were much harder to set up, the app is slower, they do integrate perfectly with my Amazon Echo; but unlike the TP Smart Plugs, the WeMo switches seem to randomly lose connection. I'll load up the app, and it will say the switches are offline. That means I have to actually press the little button the switches to turn them on (oh, the horrors!), or restart the app. These are relatively minor differences, but they do kind of matter when you're spending money on convenience gadgets.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

I like that I can control remotely if desired, with the Echo when needed and groups and schedules set.

"TP-LINK Smart Plug = FAIL, WeMo Smart Plug = PASS",2.0 ,"Once again, Amazon's bizarre policy of combining reviews for different products makes the reviewing almost useless. My review is for the TP-LINK Smart Plug. 1) Like most people, I have been trained to avoid any product with the name, ""Smart"" in it. I thought I would make an exception this time, but I was wrong. 2) Setup was easy. You must set up an account and give your email address. Some people don't like this aspect with SOME remote control companies. However, it has the advantage of allowing you to control something with multiple iPhones, without having to bring the iPhone to the product being controlled. For example, if you are 1000 miles away from your switch you could purchase a brand-new iPhone, install the app, logon, and you're back in business. ( With WeMo, every iPhone must be temporarily put on the same network as the switch in order to configure the iPhone app. ) 3) I installed the Kasa app on my wife's iPhone, I logged in and was controlling the switch successfully, even when not on the local network. 4) The switch worked fine for about 4 hours, then it lost contact with my Wi-Fi. The switch was only about 5 feet away from my WiFi hotspot. and definitely had power. I have Wi-Fi cameras set up at this location and they were working perfectly. My WiFi was good. I should note, that my setup is a little different from most. I am using a Verizon Wi-Fi hotspot in a remote location. I have used this Verizon hotspot with many products, and never had any issues. I don't know if this is related to the failure or not. Next I tried a WeMo Wi-Fi switch. Setup was simple, however every iOS device must be temporarily placed on the same network as the WeMo Wi-Fi switch for set up purposes. The WeMo Wi-Fi switch Is continuing to work. I am disappointed in this TP-LINK Smart Plug. I've owned several other products made by TP-LINK and they have always done their job well. Maybe I just received a bad unit, (this can happen to any company, even Apple). I see others have left 5-star reviews, I am only reporting what happened to me.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Works Perfectly with Echo,5.0 ,"I bought this for use with our Echo (Alexa). It works flawlessly. Download the Kasa app to set up the plug. Enable the Kasa skill for Echo, and you are good to go. You don't have to say, ""Alexa, tell Kasa to turn on the lights."" You simply say, ""Alexa, turn on the lamp,"" or whatever. I am using it for our Christmas tree so I don't have to plug and unplug it constantly. I tell Alexa to turn on the christmas tree lights, and she does. I has worked flawlessly, every time. Because it may matter, I will mention that we use an Airport Extreme and an Airport Express router. The Express is closest to this plug, so that is probably what it connects to.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Worked until 3/2/17,1.0 ,"Like seemingly everybody else, this stopped connecting to my echo device today. I did a factory reset and it works locally using the Kasa app, but won't allow me to turn on ""remote control"" to turn it on or off when I'm outside my wifi network... much less control it through my echo.

Useful tool but design leaves room for improvement,4.0 ,"In terms of being a useful tool for home security and ease of activating lights/appliances, this is a great product. We use the smart plug as a timer for our living room lamps to make it appear as someone is home, as well as to turn appliances on/off right from the couch (when we're feeling lazy). Further, the ability to turn it on/off from our phone not only adds to the spontaneity for home security purposes, it's also great for hard-to-reach plug in situations, such as plugging in the xmas tree. The only drawback is that the design of this product covers the other plug of a traditional duplex outlet. Thus, you must sacrifice an entire outlet to use it.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

TP Link Smart Plug is so easy to set up!,5.0 ,"To begin with, I am 68 years old. That being said, I just finished setting up a TP Link Smart Plug, from setting up an account on Kasa to enabling the Smart Home skill on Alexa. I scheduled the Smart Plug to cycle a lamp twice a day and it turned on perfectly right on time. Using the Kasa App on my IPad was seamless, as was enabling the skill on the Alexa App. Since I got my Echo Dot less than a week ago I have had a great time using it and now I have the Smart Plug set up as well. My house is simple without lots of bells and whistles, but I am still glad I invested in the Echo...I am sure I will use even more of it!s functionality in the future.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

BUT - AMAZING - set up was SO SIMPLE. THESE GUYS HAVE FIGURED IT OUT. I have an Iphone - I love pulling up the free App - and turning on and off the lamps I have these things hooked to... And I've scheduled them - so they turn on and off when I dictate.

Undecided on TP-Link Smart Plug,3.0 ,"I'm undecided on this device vs Wemo. Setup was more complicated than Wemo, and the biggest negative thing is that you have to create an account on TP-Link to use Echo with it, AND, add a skill to Echo. Oh and you need to use the Kasa app to set it up, so now I have a Wemo app and a Kasa app for these switches. I originally set this up saying only use wi-fi, thinking Echo would be able to get to it since it's on the same network, but NO, you must enable Remote Control, which means the id/password on Tp-Link, and adding a skill and sheesh. Does it work now? Yes, with a pain in the you know what setup.

With it linked up with Alexa I no longer have to struggle to turn on the lights or come home to a darkened house.

UPDATE: I've now installed a total of 6 TP-Link Smart Plugs. We had a brief period where they wouldn't respond to Alexa commands but would respond to the iPhone app. We left them unplugged for 24 hours and they resumed operating normally.

Functional but bulky,4.0 ,"It is easy enough to set up, both to the wifi and to my Amazon Echo. Only issue I have with it is its thickness... While the plug fit the lamp it now controls fit fine behind my couch, the combo if the smart plug and the device plug becomes too bulky to do so, so I had to use an extension cord to make it work.

Wait for the next version.,2.0 ,"I got these off an Alexa deal and was very excited to be able to control items remotely. I almost sent them back. First, the design is poor. They cover the entire wall outlet, allowing only this item to be in use, which is frustrating. They also stick out of the wall about four inches when an item is plugged into them, which is a lot. Second, they do not always connect to the internet. I used one for my Christmas tree and at least 50% of the time Alexa could not find it. Its hard explaining to our two year old why we can't turn on the lights of the tree yet. Maybe the next version will have a little more thought put into them.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

I live in a 4th floor apartment and I like that I can turn the lights on from the parking lot remotely through the app without having to be on the local wifi. These units are pretty big.

So Far So Good With Alexa,5.0 ,Bought an Echo during the holiday sale and knew I wanted to control some lamps with it to help avoid turning on my powerful ceiling lights. I only got one of these plugs so far but will be buying a few more for the few lamps I have around the apartment. I moved this plug from the lap to the Christmas tree since I got tired of crawling under it and stretching for the plug when turning the lights on. Setup was easy with the TPLink app on the phone.

Worth the money!,5.0 ,"Just received this today. Within about 5 minutes, I had Alexa turning my lamps on and off. Set up was extremely easy, and very straight forward. The hard part is training myself to use Alexa to turn on/off the device rather than manually. While I get the utility of the hub devices (most of which you can operate manually and with voice seamlessly), this TP link was 1/5 of the cost of many of those other devices. I still think these smart home devices are overpriced as a whole, but Echo combined with TP link gives me an affordable and useful smart home feature for a real actively low price. the TP link smart plug seems to be very well made.

Works like a charm,5.0 ,"Simple, reliable, effective.

(I should note that even while disconnected like this, they'll still carry out whatever scheduling options you'd set previously) As others have mentioned, the big gripe I have with the plugs has been that its size blocks both female adapters on a standard wall plug (I imagine it's probably intentional, but I'm not sure why), which is a pain but can be circumvented with $1 ""cheater plugs"" from Home Depot.

Hubless WiFi wall plug & switch that just painlessly works,4.0 ,"Always wanted some home automation system, but in reading the horror stories of the past always made me back off. Happened across this device here at Amazon. For the reduced price, I took the risk and ordered one. WOW -- what a plug. NO special hub needed. This unit connects directly to your home 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi router and controlled by the Kasa Android/iOS app that programs and controls your switches. More later. Unboxed and set up my plug. You will need to have an Android or iOS device to perform the set up. If you do not have one, there is NO way to properly install or use this plug. There is NO web site to perform this task. I give fair warning to you and you can continue your search for a different type of connection set-up. Downloaded the Kasa app from the Google Play Store to both my Android devices. Proceeded to register for a TP Link remote access account. An email will be sent to the address you provide. After confirming this is really your email account, set up continues. Since I had only one light switch, programming one name was easy. After the app finds your home network (Wi-Fi) enter your security password. Mine is connected to a WPA2-AES Netgear routed network. With the correct password, my router recognized the TP Link plug right off. Once done, I manually changed the plug IP address in my LAN settings to a static address, so the plug will always connect to the same connection address. Less work for the router to do when a reboot happens. Testing this plug further, I played with a light unplugging and replugging the outlet in different wall sockets in the house. All locations were found and connected to my wireless network. Testing, I was able to turn the light on and off at will. Next up was a remote test off premises and away from my Wi-Fi network. Walked down the the end of my street and turned on the light -- failure. What went wrong? Walked down the street again -- the 4G LTE signal took additional time to connect with the TP Link servers via the Kasa app. The first try failed giving me a message of ""connection failed, please try again later"" Tried again a couple seconds later -- success. If you have connections issues, try a second time, this should be successful. Don't lose the installation instruction. There is no replacement instructions for this model plug on the TP Link support web site. Both my wife and I are happy with this plug that we just ordered two more for different devices we have here at the house. The ability to control lights and appliances remotely, in town or away is great. I have to play with this plug more and will supplement this review after a brief time to conduct additional testing under varied conditions. I'm pleased with the purchase and this product deserves, rightful so, my 5 star rating. ******* 05/12/2016 - Update I now have three (3) of these wall plugs connected to my home Wi-Fi network. All three (3) with static IP addresses on my LAN network. All having reconnected with my network after one power outage and several plug movements from their originating and paring positions. If you want to use these plug remotely (the very reason you buy them), you have to change the identifying name on your router. The default name is HS-100 and they will show up as HS-100, but the router is confused when the Kasa app is opened (even though the MAC addresses are different for each plug). It will allow for only one switch to work remotely and the other two to be under local Wi-Fi network control. When I changed the names on my router and gave them separate static addresses at the same time, all plugs worked remotely. A helpful tip. Unlike other home security items controlled by remote (like IP cameras), NO need to do any fancy port forwarding and router tricks to make them work. They are plug-n-play after you find them on your network through the Kasa app. Manual turn on provision is the easy part. Programmed time works just as will, programming the plug from the Kasa app. You have to program one separate ""on"" time and a second separate ""off"" time. I understand that up to 50 separate times can be stored per plug. I have not tried it. One reviewer blasted the security, or the lack thereof these plugs. He brings up several points, but overall, someone has to have some pretty sophisticated hardware and programming skills to catch these plugs passing your Wi-Fi password info across the local network. Nothing is absolutely secure. If somebody really wants that info, they will get it -- plain and simple. The statistical chances of your Wi-Fi network being hacked by these plugs are very remote at best. I would far more worried about a ""smash and grab"" theft/robbery of your computer hardware, compromising your network directly, or an armed robbery of your cell phone with the Kasa app than a sniffer outside waiting, waiting, waiting to capture your plugs talking with your network. More paranoia than anything else. Use these plugs in good health. I enjoy knowing that they just work, locally and remotely, with the ability to verify that your lights are working properly and at your programmed times. Nuff said. ******* 05/22/2016 - Update I created a monster! My wife plays with these wall plugs all the time with her Android phone. On, off, on, off. Such small things bring that much pleasure cannot be all bad. Hey, if she uses them like this, I'm happy and just confirms that I made the right purchase. ******* 06/15/2016 - Update Just returned from a week long trip out-of-state. Put these plugs through a more thorough test while away from home. Viewing and switching remotely, on both Wifi and 4G LTE from my phone, they worked as represented. I was able to verify this remotely with my IP cams in the house. Changing my pre-programed settings remotely worked also. A nice convenience. Thus far, with over a month of use, these plugs just work. I also understand (with the last Kasa app update), TP-Link is rereleasing a wall switch based upon the same technology as these wall plugs. The model will be the HS-200. No release date has been set as of this time. When they come out, I will upgrade several wall switches for my lights with the HS-200 switches. ******** 09/29/2016 - HS200 wall switch installation Discount Coupon time ($5.00 off), picked one up from Amazon as phase two (2) of operation ""Home Automation w/o a Hub"" project continues. Came today and just finished installing it. Unboxed the switch. Nicely packed with foam protection surrounding the face plate. Four (4) wires to connect: * Green for ground * White for neutral * Black (2 wires) for line and load (neither one marked for line or load) * Extra wire nuts were included - a nice touch I have mine connected to a 50 watt Track-Light set up with 5 LED BR30 bulbs. Lower wattage, but there are NO issues with flicker on power up/down. The dark side of my installation: Then the fun began. The wall switch cover (one pole/switch cover) is attached to the mounting tangs of the switch with plastic clasp hooks molded onto the face plate. I have two switches at the installed location so the included face plate had to be removed. The back side face plate hooks snap over the plastic mounting tangs on the switch and are very tough to separate. It took some careful prying to separate the faceplate from the switch so as not to break the plastic mounting tangs on the switch. Remember that when you get your switch. A bad design by TP-Link. Further, the mounting tangs on the wall switch are thicker plastic than a regular metal framed switch, so a standard wall plate may or may not fit. Mine barely fits, but there is a gap around the side edge of the wall plate. I will have to buy a deeper clearance wall plate to close the now obvious gap. Also, the switch plate cover mounting screws (the small ones that are exposed) are NOT drilled to accept the switch plate mounting screws. It took some force to get the screws started into the plastic mounting tangs on the switch. Another issue with this switch and TP-Link's bad design. This switch also did something I didn't see with the wall plugs. When I went to add the switch to the Kasa app, it took over my cell phone Wi-Fi connection. Once installation was completely configured, the wall switch released my phone Wi-Fi and let it reset to my home router. A minor distraction and why it happened is beyond me. Normal, but some warning should have been given. Now, it was not all bad. Once installed from my cell phone, other Android devices found this switch and automatically entered it into the Kasa program. All devices work remotely without an issue. Like my wall plugs, I configured this switch to a static IP address on my LAN. Reconfiguration was painless and it works just fine. All 4 plugs and switched play nice on the Kasa app. I knocked off one star for the plastic construction of the wall tangs, mounting points and packaging of the wall plate cover. The mounting tangs should have been metal and the wall plate should have rested on top of the switch, not mounted to it. NO note in the box of how to take the wall plate off the switch -- an oversight by some engineer, but not to the end user. I plan to purchase a couple more wall switches. Even with the flaws I described, they work as intended and my wife continues to play with them every day. ******* 01/02/2017 - Update I am now up to two (2) HS-200 wall switches and three (3) HS-100 wall plugs. All are connected to a second Linksys AP router (more in a minute). The switches and wall plugs continue to work flawlessly. I also have an All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black connected to my home network. Alexa with the Kasa skill plug-in has to be added in order to access these devices After the Alexis/Kasa skill app is discovered, the switches and wall plugs on my network and they phone the TP-Link servers confirming configuration, Alexa can voice control their operation. Now I tell Alexa to turn on/off a light and Alexa just does it. Another step in home automation. When I added a second Linksys router as an Access Point to my home network, my TP-Link units failed to work with either the Kasa app or by Alexa. In order to fix this problem, I had to uninstall all switches and wall plugs from the TP-Link cloud. Next, you have to perform a hard reset to the switch or plug by hand. This wipes the cloud info off the switch or wall plug completely. It is now just like you received it at purchase. Once reset, you then have to reinstall them one at a time, including renaming them again. This procedure will also apply if you change your home router from the one you originally install these devices through. I hope TP-Link corrects this problem in their Kasa app, since router replacement is quite common these days. A heads up for you. ******* 07/15/2017 - Update Prime day teased me to buy another Switch. This time the HS-105 Mini-switch. So that now makes six (6) TP-Link devices: 1 - Mini-wall plug in switch (HS-105) 2 - Regular, non-energy monitor wall switches (HS-200) and 3 - Regular, non-energy monitor wall plugs (HS-100) All have static IP addresses running off a separate access point router as described above. All work as represented and controllable by Kasa app, Alexa or Google Home. I have had only one evening where the TP-Link DNS link went down for about 3 or 4 hours. The next morning, all was fixed and TP-Link sent out an email to their customers apologizing to us for the inconvenience caused by the down TP-Link DNS service. A nice customer service touch. The HS-105 plug works great and allows you to use the second outlet plug-in, which is not blocked like with the HS-100. I wish these were introduced last year, I would have bought a total of four (4), so I can use the second plug on the wall socket.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Great device,5.0 ,"An excellent, easy to use smart plug. I am currently using it with both my iPhone and iPad running iOS and it works flawlessly on both with. Erg little setup that does not require a hub. I am still getting used to it and have forgotten to turn lights off in other parts of the house because of it though. Before, when I would turn off the lights at night I would be forced to walk through part of my house in the dark. Now, I walk to my bedroom and close the door and forget to turn the lights off using my phone. Luckily, the app has a schedule function which not only allows me to come home at night to a well lit house, but also turns the lights off for me when I forget.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

I just got it yesterday and it took me a bit to get it set up but I finally was able to do it. I am amazed how nice it works with the echo dot.

Great for vacations away from hom and xmas tree lights,5.0 ,"We've used this for about 3 months and it is great. We use it in conjunction with Alexa / the Amazon Echo to turn lamps on and off. We will also be using this for Xmas tree lights. The app is also great. We used the app to turn lamps on and off within the house while we were on vacation to a) make it look like someone was home, and b) give my cat some lighting in between house-sitter visits. We used the app to turn on the lamps and night and turn them off in the morning. You can also turn the socket on and off by the little power button on it (if Alexa is not cooperating). Ordered a few more as gifts.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Took a few times to connect to Wifi, but once connected it works as advertised and have had zero issues. Even unplugged, moved, plugged in and it reconnected to wi-fi and was Echo enabled. I did some research to find different Smart Home gadgets to use for Echo and this was by the far the cheapest. Other products required a hub for full connectivity, so this was a good starter option. My ultimate plan is to connect with the lighting around my deck and amaze my friends by having Echo turn on the deck lights. With that said, this is not listed for outdoor use so I still have the chore of setting this up ahead of time and removing before any weather.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Best Most Seemless Smartplug,5.0 ,"This smart plug is pretty awesome! First on I have bought and I'll never go back. You download the app on your iPhone and it lets you remotely control the device. It was super easy to connect to wifi and have had no drops thus far. You can set up schedules for it as well as set it in ""away"" mode. It was easy to set up with Alexa and have had no issues for it. Only issue thus far is the size and the fact that it takes up the whole plug. What ever outlet you decide to utilize can only fit this for the 2 plugs. Not enough hassle for me to drop a star. I would highly recommend this and will be purchasing two more in near future to put more lights on board.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

"Cheap, efficient, and accessible",5.0 ,"I was disappointed to learn that this doesn't have IFTTT--so for example, I can't have my phone detect when I step off the train and then turn on my AC automatically while I walk home--but I'm still giving it 5 stars just because of how unbelievably cheap they are. I own four of them, so for just over $100, for a setup that lets me, both with the (pretty decent) app and AMAZON ECHO INTEGRATION, separately control my air conditioner, hallway light, decorative lights, and nightlight. They're incredibly easy to set up, customizable, and so far have almost always been reliable.

Excellent and good customer service,5.0 ,"I bought this to use to control lights with my Echo. It works great. I also have wemo switches I have been using for a year. We recently had a momentary power outage and the TP-Link plugs came back online without a hitch. I had to play with the wemo switches to get them all back up any connected. I did have a problem when I set this to come on at sunset and it was coming on exactly one hour before sunset. An email to TP-Link support was promptly answered and, after I provided some additional information, the issue was diagnosed as an issue with automatic longitude recognition. Manually entering the longitude (very easy) solved the problem. Customer service was fast and solved the problem.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"
Amazing,5.0 ,"I have a wi-fi camera in my vacation home. Every now and then it loses connection, a quick on off solves this problem. However I am 200 miles from the house.

Getting to a connected home is finally less expensive with these,5.0 ,"I previously bought an Amazon Echo and was prepared to buy the Belkin switches. As I was shopping around, these popped up as recommended based on what others had purchased. The reviews were solid and the price was significantly cheaper, I got mine on sale, so i gave it a go. These work perfectly and for much cheaper than the Belkin ones. Setup was a breeze and the card inside the box walks you right thru it. From there the echo found the devices with no issues. I have two of these, each hooked up to lamps in my living room. So nice to just walk in from outside or from upstairs and tell Alexa to turn a light on. People that come over are always amazing, which I admit is a great perk as well.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

"Some flaws, but works",4.0 ,"Setup is hit and miss. The first outlet was terrible to set up. The second unit set up without a hassle. I use them with Alexa, so I don't use the Tp-Link Kasa app after I set it up. Thank God, because the Kasa app is not very good. The main problem with the smart plug is that it covers both outlets even when installed in the top. This is something that I know they could have avoided through better design, but chose not to. So, I have to the use a multi-plug adapter to be able to plug additional items into the outlet. That's an additional expense I hadn't counted on. Overall, I'd buy these again for the price, but would pay more for a smaller version.","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Great concept as a stand alone product, which works without a hub; hopefully just a faulty unit --- After a quick return, the replacement unit is working as it should. It is simple to program using TP-Link's KASA app for iOS. Once programmed, it can be linked to Echo through the Amazon Alexa app. As a note to TP-Link; if you guys really want this to be a stand alone product, please work with Amazon to remove the extra step of side loading KASA from the android environment...","TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (HS100)"

Great WiFi Plug,4.0 ,"Pro: Relatively straight forward to install - download the app, plug it in, connect to it and set it up. Easy to program - set the days and time to turn on or off. Assign names to each plug in the app Nice list of icons to assign each plug - lamp, humidifier, heater, light, etc Easy access to turn on and off plug Con: Kasa app was designed for smart phones and not tablets.

A bit wonky setup but works perfectly :-),5.0 ,"A bit wonky to set up. Maybe its the app and not the plug but setup refused to connect to my WiFi network. The app gave an error message of the plug being previously registered, maybe from the first setup attempt? When that happened I held the reset button on the plug for 10 seconds to reset it and tried again which worked. I set up three, two needed more than one attempt to set up. Once setup they work like a dream. :-) Schedules & timers all work without the app running.

I've had to call tech support twice for help, and neither time was there someone who could speak English. Nor did they have anyone who could call me back who did!

5 star? read on,5.0 ,"Months later review: I've been using these now for a while, in a family of 'power' users, meaning our pg&e bill can get high. With these I can monitor what is running and for how long, and have the option to turn things off if needed (like my fridge). A few handy things for me are: 1) I can track our refrigerator's usage over days/weeks, its not all bad until it turns on the defrost cycle! 2) I've used a few to turn on / off AC grid tie inverters (with battery packs) to mitigate our power usage during high-use times. And I can see the reduction on our rainforest smart meter monitor, confirming the power reading on these smart plugs which is a great feature to have. 3) I like the app, its fairly straightforward, and has triggered power on/off functions which I like. I use that to turn off chargers once they fall below a watt level where they are no longer providing much charge. I've inadvertently had the 'new trigger' turn off when power exceeds ___W, and they would instantly turn back off. I initially thought I had a problem, but the notification told me otherwise, cluing me on my error... Some things I think would be helpful: 1) wifi access but no internet (you know, just in case it goes down LOL) the app can still access the smart plugs if my local wifi network is still alive and my phone is connected to it. (internet hasn't died just yet, but don't want to find out with working wifi, the smart plugs no longer work) 2) work with the Stringify app. Stringify needed a public API to be able to use Etekcity's smart plugs. This makes both a powerful tool when it comes to monitoring things. For example, if my smart meter goes over a preset power setting, I could tell it to turn on/off certain smart plugs. Alexa is nice to have, but its short lived. Alexa doesn't have the same monitoring Vesync has or any app pass-through feature which would allow other apps to use Alexa as a control or host. 3) if #2 is simply impossible, create a new function in the ""new trigger action"" menu to turn on or off other smart outlets in my menu. For example, if outlet 1 power drops below xxx watts, turn on outlet 2. This would allow you to cascade functions to accomplish doing more with them. 4) notifications don't show up on my cell, only within the Vesync app. email works, but it lags by minutes/hours. 5) for some reason, if I'm in a monitor menu and I press the super button to get me back the phone, when I reopen Vesync, there is a different smart plug picture and none of the readings work. Hitting back a few times gets me to the smart plug menu, guessing that's a bug. You might be wondering, why all this? PG&E and deregulation (which hasn't happened). I pay rates 2-3x higher than someone who lives a few miles down the road. Does solar help? sure, but PG&E's payback is a nickel per kWh, and charge you 20c per kWh used and then there's the penalty stage if you go over the baseline which seems to be based on nobody at home from 8-5, m-f. My bill is lower because I can see / manage my power usage better, thanks to Etekcity's smart plugs. Yeah, I've tried Dlink, range is worse, their update bricked one that actually measured power, and their cost is higher. And they were constantly losing connection even in line of sight (50') to wifi. So Etekcity's have better range (I have 4 smart plugs in another garage on my lot), better reliability (yeah i got 3 customer returns -poorly packed was the clue- that I returned, lost some hours I wont get back) but overall, better performance for your money. Pointers: Check the monitor watts menu to see you're within its power rating too. I'm working these fairly good, 2-3x / day up to 1000W for hours at a time, varying locations on my lot and with noisy equipment. So mine are seeing a fair amount of use. Problems with initial connection? Closing the app and restarting helps. I've checked to see how many things were on my network and if it was full, there was no indication that it was... I paid for all my smart plugs, received nothing for this review other than the (replacements for duds) and satisfaction using them. Hope that helps someone deciding to buy or not.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Super easy setup and works better than D-Link and other named brands,5.0 ,"This is easily the best deal for two outstanding WiFi Alexa (Amazon Echo) Enabled outlets. There is no annoying setup and issues connecting to WiFi. It even has energy monitoring and the APP is SUPER simple and well designed. Setup took me only 3 minutes including Alexa setup.

Download the VeSync App and register for a free account with just email and password. 2. Make sure to connect to your normal 2.4ghz WiFi network for setup and click the + sign to add new outlet on the APP. 3. Put your WiFi password in and click Connect 4.

Works with MAC Filtering and on Other Networks,4.0 ,"My room has an open network with MAC filtering (common in universities and company offices) and it doesn't meet the network requirements listed in the manual. Thus here's a brief guide for those having difficulties setting this up on other network types. [Setup on Network with MAC Filtering] In the official manual, it asks that you avoid connecting the plugs to a MAC filtering network, presumably because you can't find out the MAC address of the plugs. I figured out the mac addresses of my plugs by setting up the plugs to my raspberry pi hotspot and then running ""tail -f /var/log/syslog"" to view the mac addresses of devices connecting to the raspberry pi; you can do the same on Windows hotspot. In the process, I figured out a shortcut: the plug's MAC address is simply the ID of the plug appended to 2c:3a:e8. In other words, if your plug is named ""ESP_123ABC"" then its MAC address is ""2c:3a:e8:12:3A:BC"". To view the plug ID, use the optional APN setup in the VeSync app and then add the MAC address to your network's filter. [Raspberry Pi Hotspot] Sometimes we just do not have 2.4G wifi network, the work-around I found is to connect a raspberry pi via ethernet cable to the 5.0G network and then host a hotspot with 2.4G. This obviously has its limitations such as speed and stability for multiple plugs. The guide can be found on google: ""adafruit learning system, setting up a raspberry pi as a wifi access point, created by lady ada"". [Minus One Star - Things that the Plugs Will Never Work with] Android 7.0 and above lacks the ability to switch to 2.4G, so if your only phone runs Android 7 then I would advise against a purchase. Networks that requires you to login with an ""Identity"" (EAP encryption) in addition to the password is not supported by the app setup.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

Good product with a lot of potential,4.0 ,"Absolute trash. First plug broke within seconds of being plugged in, the second malfunctioned about 2 weeks later. Edit: I am updating my review from a previously 1 star review to a 4 star review for one reason: the customer service. I had problems with my order and customer service got into contact with me quickly and provided advice and replacements, absolutely wonderful and extremely friendly. I've taken a few weeks to thoroughly test the product and for the most part it works as intended. Pros: - Quick to set up - Easily controlled through app - App has some nice basic features such as countdown timers, routines and usage history Cons: - The plugs can be extremely sensitive so definitely make sure to set triggers to turn off the plug safely at about 800W, otherwise any kind of surge will fry them in my experience - The app needs work; better password recovery and perhaps an online presence independent of the app would be nice, a way to share the plugs between a few different users (other than all signing into the same account) would be great, and a more streamlined interface would be nice. The basic features work but the interface can be slow to update and I would love some integration with apple home so that I don't have to enter the app and click 4 times every time I want to toggle a switch. Ultimately the product works and the customer service is great, you can't ask for more than that. I hope this review helps improve the product and I do hope Etekcity keeps working to improve this product, it has great potential.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

It's works but only briefly until you have to redo the setup,4.0 ,"Update 9/24: Over the past month or so, the products have been very stable. Seems whatever update was done seems to have made a difference. Thank you for addressing the situation. Update 6/17: spoke too soon. Your device or group is not responding.... UPDATE 6/16: Customer service contacted me to let me know they had an issue and have restored the connection. Since that notice, account was able to link up and so far everything has stayed connected. In addition on my part, I did do a dhcp ip reserve on the devices just to ensure they keep the same up address. But everything seems to be working fine now. This is my second set. When I first bought the product, had it a week and it worked great, integrated wonderfully with Alexa, everything. So I ordered another set to integrate. Now after adding this second set, it constantly gives a message that the device isn't responding in which you have to completely remove, resetup, then go into Alexa, forget the skill, and reenable. Now the site is down to link the account and these 4 outlets are completely useless, completely bricked. Do not waste your time with these.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

and this smart plug performs the best,5.0 ,"I've tried two other brands (HAUSBELL and TP-LINK), and this smart plug performs the best. Its smaller and and you can configure it so the light only activates when the WIFI link is dead. Its smart phone app is easy to use and set up various timers for multioke devices. The connection to Alexa works after you add the smart home skill for the app Versync. These plugs also monitor energy usage for plug so you can use it for more than a remote for lights.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Loss of Internet Connection Disables These Devices,4.0 ,"These devices are very simple to install and setup on the app is quick as well. That being said, before you buy this product you should know that it does not function AT ALL without internet access. The description says ""WiFi wireless control"", but the fact is that if your internet connection goes down for whatever reason [even though your WiFi network is still fully functional] you cannot control any of these devices. For example, let's say you have several computers on the same WiFi network along with a printer and have file sharing turned on, you can copy/view files and print all day long even if the internet goes down. ---> controlling these devices seems to require that the ON/OFF command leave your local WiFi and go out onto the internet to the manufacturer website for whatever reason...and then return to your local WiFi network. So, this also requires that the manufacturer server is not down for maintenance as well, adding yet another point of failure. Before you purchase, simply be aware of how they operate and how this may differ from what you’re expecting, and don't let your internet bill go unpaid because all of your device control goes away if the internet connection goes down for scheduled maintenance, damaged cable company line, or whatever reason.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
"Good smart plug, but it has flaws",1.0 ,"Update on Aug 30, 2017... I returned all six plugs yesterday. The android app is very buggy and does not respond. Scheduling is unreliable. Update on Aug 23 2017... New VeSync 1.70 update did not fix the refresh problem. Refresh should be automated without the user intervention. VeSync was down for more than 30 minutes for the upgrade few minutes ago. During the that time I did not have any control over any of my 6 plugs. My concern is that dozens of small companies selling Wifi smart devices and they all have their own apps. What happens if these companies go down or disappear? Their smart devices become useless without the backend server. Lastly I am taking another start out until you fix this app!!! This is a good product. I have had it for a day, but I have already discovered the followings: The plug consumes .84 watts when plugged in and turned off. If you turn it on it uses 1.29 watts itself. I intentionally disabled my SSID and then enabled it. It took a long time for the plug to show that it is connected to the wireless. I also have TP-Link HS105. For HS105 the re-connect was almost immediate. The android app has issues as well. If you manually turn off or on the plug, the app does not update the status unless you do a manual refresh in the app. I have contacted VeSync about this. Finally, I am taking out three stars. VeSync if you are reading this, update the firmware and the app and I will give it a five star","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Great smart plugs that allow to you to see energy consumption!,5.0 ,"I purchased these Etekcity 2 Pack Mini Smart Plug Outlet, No Hub Required, WiFi Wireless Energy Monitoring, Remote Control Light Switch Socket, Works with Alexa, White to add to my already huge smart home implementation. These come inside a brown box with white print, and then each plug is also in its own brown box with white print inside the bigger box. Inside each box in the plug and instructions. Installation was quite easy and the app worked just as expected. Be sure to install the Echo skill and ask Alexa to discover devices after installing these so that she can control them. Of course, whatever you name them is what you will have to tell Alexa, so be mindful during initial setup or you will have to redo some work. I am very impressed by these plugs. I did not realize they would allow me to view power consumption, which is really just fantastic. I was hoping for something that could just turn things on and off, but I have moved these around to some devices just to see what the power draw is. The quality is very good and these have worked very well so far. I would love to purchase a 12 pack of these for a broader implementation!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Outdated software and short life - UPDATED: EVEN SHORTER LIFE,1.0 ,"Received these, plugged them in, downloaded the (android) app, and... nothing. App complains that the phone needs to be switched to 2.4Ghz wifi. Same with a tablet. Tried another phone, same issue. This basically means it's not possible to do a set-up with any recent Android device. It's also a very unnecessary limitation, as Android's WifiManager can scan both frequency bands just fine. In older version of Android (5.x and earlier), the user could disable the 5Ghz wifi band, but in Android 6 and 7, this is no longer an option -- mainly because it's truly not necessary for any reason. This software is either quite old or very poorly written -- VeSync, contact me, I can fix this for you. As an Android developer, I have quite a few devices around for testing, and I was finally able to find an older Android tablet which allowed me to complete the set-up. Once these outlets were set up, they worked quickly and reliably... at least several times. After only three days, one of them stopped working. The relay clicks and the light toggles on and off, but the connected load never switches on. This would seem to indicate that there's something wrong with the relay, or worse, the relay contacts. That's a bit scary, as intermittent electrical contacts are a main cause for electrical fires. UPDATE 8/28/17: VeSync updated the software and accidentally removed the detail fragment, and with it all ability to set/review/delete timers and triggers. It took a few days for them to reinstate that through another software update. It appears that there is not even a minimum amount of testing going on there. UPDATE 9/6/17: Etekcity contacted me and offered to send me a replacement at no cost, and I wouldn't even have to send in the broken one. Seems strange, because any other engineering company would be glad to receive failed devices to see what failed, and improve this in the future. While waiting, I decided to use the second plug -- which was still working... well, for a few days. This one lasted two days before being permanently off (yes, lights are on, but nobody's home). Further checking revealed that THESE ARE NOT UL LISTED. Regardless of their offer to replace these, they didn't actually honor that offer, so the point is moot. Staying away from these. $5 savings aren't worth weekly replacements or worse yet, a burned-down house.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
I want to love these but... [UPDATED] Now I can,4.0 ,"I hate doing this, I've never left a 1 star, but I'm getting no email response from the seller and I'm having issues. 1 of these worked great, simple setup and off and running. Second one will never give me a solid blue light to get it configured. Does anybody know how to fully reset this thing so that it will enter config mode (solid blue LED)? I can only get a slow blinking blue and it wont configure. I need to sort this out, because I am running out of time to return both of them for a refund, although I'd really rather not have to. Hopefully the seller sees this and will make contact about getting this one working or replaced. I'd happily change this review to more starts if I can get this sorted asap. EDIT: After posting a 1-star review, the vendor made contact with me and reported they never received my previous email request for assistance. Fair enough I say (email is not perfect). They offered a simple fix. I had tried holding the button down for a full reset, but didn't realize it needed to be held for a FULL 20 seconds before it would fully reset. Once this worked, I was able to configure this one as easily as the first one. These are pretty clever devices (when you can get them into configuration mode). App is simple but effective, although I do receive a lot of in-app messages reporting up and down connectivity to the outlets. Even with this happening, I have not yet had a failure to activate the outlet with the button press within the app. Echo (Alexa) controls work well too. Pretty cool to be able to turn things off and on with voice commands. I want to give the product 5 stars, but considering the difficulties with the 'trouble right out of the box' experience, I feel I have to reduce by a star.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Amazing customer service team.,5.0 ,"The outlets would not connect to wifi at all. I ordered the 2 pack and followed all the instructions, even watching youtube videos to make sure I was operating them correctly. The outlets would hang everytime the app tried to connect them to my wifi. I tried them on different networks, I tried them in multiple areas of the house, and I even unplugged them and tried again the following day but each time the app counted up to 500 seconds while ""setting up my connection"" and then told me it was unsuccessful. I returned them. UPDATE: The seller contacted me and wanted to try and make it right. They sent me another round of the product in hopes that my experience would be better. I'm happy to say that the product works great! I'm not sure why the first two didn't work at all. Setup was super easy and now I can use Alexa to control my fan and light in my room which is super convenient! Awesome customer service! Thank you!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Genius Invention with some quirks,4.0 ,"We have 2 echo dot: 1 in the living room and 1 in the master bedroom. I purchased the iHoan smart plugs during a sale day and started using them for our bedroom swing arm wall sconces and was thrilled with the efficiency! The only negative was how large they are so I looked into smaller units and found these. We use these for the living room lamps and they have worked out almost perfectly. Pros: -The app makes it easy to set a scheduled time for them to turn o/off each night. This not only makes sure the lamps come on when we need them but also that when we are away it looks like someone is home! -They work seamlessly with Alexa once you enable the skill in the Alexa app. There have only been a few times that she didn't recognize what we are saying but it only takes a repeat command to get it her to turn them on. -I love that they can be grouped together and named something unique so that we can give a simple command to turn them on. Cons: -Setup was more difficult than it should have been. For some reason, these could not connect the normal way (despite our router transmitting both 5 and 2.4 speeds). I had to manually connect to each outlet but pushing the button until they blink & them finding them in the app. -These outlets are located very close to our home router and the echo dot but one of the outlets continues to lose connection so 1 lamp doesn't turn on. I have to manually set the switch up again or press the button so it can search, this kind of defeats the point of this switch. -While they are small, they still take up quite a bit of room on the outlet which makes it impossible to plug in a vacuum​ or anything else with 3 prongs. I solved this by using a power adaptor so we have additional plugs.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Energy metering off by 30 watts. Price is cheap,2.0 ,"My biggest gripe is that the electric metering seemes to be off by around 30 watts. To test I used this to monitor an AC window unit on ""fan only"" (to take the compressor out of the equation). The Kill-a-watt meter I have read at 170w. The 2 from this pack read at 202w. The TP-Link model read at 174w. The volts also showed 135, when of course that was 120. The programming also isn't as clean/nice/ thought out as tp-link. Has a Chinese feel, for ex the timer fester has a minute scroller that goes to 99 and a second that goes to 59 and no hour scroller. So if I wanted this to turn off in 2 hours I can't set that without going into a more complex setting. There are other oversight / usability issues in other areas of the app also.. but for the price compared to other manufacturers it's not worth getting into. 1 out of 2 of the ones I received is really responsive with Alexa and works just as quick and seamlessly as the tp-link model. The other keeps crashing and may take 4 times of me telling Alexa to turn it on. I may have to return /exchange if a factory reset won't work. This 2 pack (with ""metering"") was 34.99 vs tp-link's 1 pack (hs110) is 36.99. If you don't care about energy usage, but a quality product I would hands down spend another $20 and get tp-link's mini 2 pack (without metering) @ 59.99.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Excellent smart outlet!,5.0 ,"If you're looking for a small form smart outlet that has Alexa integration, then this product from Tekcity is a fantastic option. Setup for me from opening to voice command on my Alexa was 5min tops. Super easy and intuitive directions set this apart from other products I've tried. The outlet itself is very well made and has some pretty thick plastic for its housing. The round shape is nice and if you plug this in on the bottom of an outlet, you'll still have access to the top. Vice versa for the opposite. The light indicator lets you know when it is off. App installation was simple and enabling the Alexa skill even easier. Can't recommend it enough as it works as promised!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Works well with no problems,5.0 ,"Works well with no problems. I own several other brands of smart plugs, but the Etekcity Voltson smart plug is my favorite. I especially like the VeSync Outlet app that is used to control them. Very responsive and it notifies me if the smart plug goes off line due to a wifi interruption. The one big plus with this smart switch is it's ability to resume the exact state it was in after a power failure. In other words ... if the switch was either ON or OFF, after the power is resumed the switch will return to the same ON or OFF position. All the other smart witches I've tried resumes to the OFF position regardless of were it was previously. That's a problem if you are at a remote location. You won't be able to turn the ""other brands"" of smart switches back on until you physically return to the same location as the switch and resume a connection on your smartphone to the same wifi network. That's a big deal if you are using a smart plug at a summer home, winter home, vacation home, or any place you might be away from for an extended period of time.

Unresponsive? (Updated),3.0 ,"I am using one of the plugs to control a small fan. Sometimes when I use Alexa on my Echo Dot to turn it off it seems like it would short then become unresponsive but the plug would stay on. I have to wait at least a few minutes or so for it to response again. Or sometimes I unplug it then re-plug it then it still takes a minutes for it to work. It defeats the whole point of having a smart plug. I've borrowed another fan to test it out and plug it in another outlet just in case that was causing the problem. I still have the same problem after test it with another fan and outlet. It happens at random when I want to turn it off. You could also trigger it by turning the plug on and off repeatedly using the app. Of course that's not how I use it normally. But it still happens enough even when you don't try to trigger the problem. One star unless I can solve this. Update: I did some more testing to find out what was causing the problem for this plug. I tested the plug with my Vitamix blender plugged into it. I set the blender to six and it was using about 90+ watts according to the app. Then I went ahead and turned the switch off and on using the app for about fifty times. It didn't become unresponsive at all. The app did say the plug is unresponsive but it wasn't really. I think that was just app glitch or whatever for a split second. I was able to press it on and off again immediately. Also the plug's LEDs didn't start to cycle through colors as it if has reset itself. I think the two fans that I have tested it on might be the cause of problem. Both the fans have a fuse located on the plug. I figure it's what is causing the smart plug to reset. After only eight times of controlling the plug with the app to turn on and off, it has already reset itself on the eighth time and was unresponsive. The LEDs were cycling through the colors. Of course the reason I was only turning it off and on using the app is to trigger the problem and figure out a way to fix it. But using it daily it becomes very annoying. It happens enough that it is unusable, with the current fans that I have at least. I think the solution is to buy a new fan, ones without fuses. Also one of the fans that I was using it with is the Holmes Lil' Blizzard. Which is a great fan for the price. It's shame that it's causing the smart plug problems.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Fantastic TP-Link HS100 alternative.,5.0 ,"I had installed a TP-Link HS100 to test out controlling a lamp via Alexa in our home and had good experiences with it, other than how physically huge that unit is. Configuration was easy, integration with our Echos and Dots was cake and things ""just worked"". Then I saw these, their high-star reviews, price-point and finally, their physical footprint. I couldn't hit ""Proceed to checkout"" quick enough. Two days later they arrived (thank you, Prime!) and I got them up and running quickly. The VeSync app is not as clean as Kasa is, but it gets the job done -- hopefully that gets worked on in the future. My test for this was simply two lamps grouped together. Easy peasy, simply define the two plugs in VeSync, discover them with the Alexa app, make a device group for them and BAM, you're in business. As long as these two survive the next couple of weeks of use, I'll be ordering more for sure and will absolutely recommend them to family and friends. The value proposition for the two-pack cannot be beat at this point!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Love how easy it was to setup two outlets to ...,4.0 ,"Love how easy it was to setup two outlets to control lights in our house. Log on the web site and create your account. Download the app on any device you want to use for control of the outlets and log on. We installed on our phones and tablets (android). Make sure to have your wi-fi password on hand, then plug a unit in and wait for the blue light. Click on add device and when connected select the wi-fi and input password. You can now manually control the on and off for the device configured. We have both setup as night lights, so setup a timer option for when each would go on and then turn off. There wasn't any directions for how to setup to use with Alexa (reason only 4 stars). I logged on my laptop and connected to the Alexa/amazon web site and found the option to add a device. Still working out the naming of it so I can properly tell Alexa which unit to control. Now I just have one as UP and the other as DOWN. Haven't completely figured out the naming and what to tell Alexa as it only works half the time.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
This is a good product as it was very easy to install/set-up.,5.0 ,"This is a good product as it was very easy to install/set-up. The system is pretty sensitive to my Wifi and I was able to use it within less than 10 mins and it works great. I was able to use the preset timer, time count down, and other override functions. It comes in a hard cardboard box with each outlet boxed separately in a smaller box.

Wifi plugs working great ......finally.,5.0 ,"Had a little difficulty getting them set up and working with Alexa. First was my fault. I transposed two characters of my wifi password. Took a while to figure that out. Second, the plugs named themselves with a name that Alexa could not understand. I finally figured out how to rename the plugs with simple names that Alexa could comprehend. I planned on using Alexa to set timers for my lights to turn on and off......super difficult for Alexa to do.....However, I found that this capability is included in the plug app itself....... no mention of this ability by Etekcity or any instructions included. Figured it out on my own......don't need Alexa, but she can turn them on and off by just asking her. I called Etekcity for customer support help. They tried and said they would call me back. I figured out things finally by myself but they did call me back the next day to make sure I got things working...... very responsive customer support.

Worry Reliever,5.0 ,"I am really happy with these wifi enabled mini smart plugs. They were easy to set up: just downloaded the app, connected to my wifi, configured the plugs and paired with my Echo Dot. The entire process took less than 20 minutes. They have never dropped from my network connection and so far they have worked every time. I use one plug for the small electric free standing wood burning replica fireplace heater in the den. Now I don't have to worry that maybe I left the heater on when I left. I just check the app on my smartphone if it's off great and if not, I can turn it off via the app. Either way, I'm immediately relieved of worry. I use the other plug for the desk lamp (I always forget to turn off) in my woman cave. I just tell Alexa to turn off the desk lamp and I don't have to trek downstairs to turn it off. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and recommend them to any one with a smartphone or an Echo.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Happy - As Good as Competitive Brand that Costs More,5.0 ,"This was about as easy as you could make it. I first downloaded and installed the VeSync app on my phone (be sure to create account in the app). You'll get an email confirming your account set-up and it will include a confirmation code, you'll need to enter that code into the app. I want to use this with Amazon Echo so I also downloaded the VeSync skill in my Amazon Alexa app. I did these steps while I waited for my order to be delivered. Once order was delivered, I plugged the smart plug into outlet and waited for blue light. Using the app I added the outlet, entered my WiFi password (be sure phone is connected to your 2.4ghz band). Outlet was added and I could easily turn outlet on/off through app. Added second outlet as well. You will most likely want to edit the name of the outlet ensuring it's unique and easy for you to recognize the outlet (e.g. Front Room Light). I went into Amazon Alexa app, did a search for devices and the two new outlets were found (you need to do the search so devices are added). I was then able to tell Alexa to ""Turn On Front Room Light"" and light turned on. Told Alexa to ""Turn Off Front Room Light"" and light turned off. Done! Total time to set-up both outlets was 5 minutes. I also have TP-Link HS100 outlets, bought those before I found these Etekcity outlets. The Etekcity set-up was basically the same (just different app). These Etekcity outlets also measure power usage, something the TP-Link HS100 outlets don't. And these are smaller too so you don't block the top outlet. And on top of that these Etekcity outlets were much less expensive. I'll see how the longevity goes with these, but very happy so far.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Nice set of Smart Plug,4.0 ,"Etekcity Smart Plug Outlet came without any damage.Package contains 2 Pieces of smart plug. Using this smart plug we can turn off or turn on any device that connected to this smart plug by installing an app on your smartphone.

Also, this app features timer functionality by which plug will be turned off based on the time set.Also, we can schedule when to turn on or turn off the device that connects to the smart plug.

The plugs work great,5.0 ,"This review is for the 2-Pack Etekcity Mini Smart Plug Outlets. I purchased these outlets to control lamps in my family room using Alexa. I have purchased other products from Etekcity and have always been pleased with the quality. These plugs are no exception. You need to download and install an app and then connect each plug to your wireless network. The instructions which come with the plugs guide you through the process. Once connected, you can turn the plugs on and off using your phone. To connect to Alexa, you need to open the Alexa app on your phone or computer (I find the computer easier to use), add the plugs to your Alexa smart devices, then have Alexa search for the plugs. Once connected, you can control lamps or other devices using voice commands. I would definitely buy again. If you are buying this as a gift, the plugs comes nicely boxed.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Affordable and Versatile Smart Home Solution - Alexa enabled :-),5.0 ,"Brilliant! The price is great and the concept is simple. Power on or power off. It is so easy to understand. The ""Alexa"" voice activation feature is awesome. I customized the names of the various plugs. ie Coffee, Living Room Light, Bedroom Light etc. Then it was simple to give the voice command to Alexa to turn these on or off. I can actually turn off all the lights AFTER I am tucked in bed and start brewing the coffee BEFORE I get up. Love it! The app also allows me to turn on lights (with mini-plug) from my car BEFORE I enter the house. All of this is great but on top of that I can use the app to monitor energy usage and schedule ""on/off"" times. Amazon is frequently out of these so if it has the ""add to car"" button, go for it!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Outstanding customer service and product support,4.0 ,"It's a pack of two and in my case one died in 5 minutes and the other one died within a day. Why the 4 starts then? Because this company stands by the quality control and product support. Right after I contacted their customer service, Etekcity offered to replace defective units and send me two more units to prove that my original experience was rather unfortunate exception than a common occurrence. I'm testing the two complimentary units now and they work as intended. If they last for couple more weeks I'll update my review to five starts for solid customer service and product support. Things happen but it takes a real company to make things right. Thank you, Etekcity.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Better Value than the Wemo,5.0 ,"Originally was going to go for the TP-Link smart plugs but went with these instead because they are smaller and track energy usage for a cheaper price. Set up was pretty painless and it seems to work well for my purposes - remote resetting of electrical components. The only things that could be improved is that they make a loud ""click"" when switching on/off and the app could be a little less buggy - needed to restarted it here and there. But otherwise, the app is pretty slick and I might buy another.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Outlet on a 2.4 GHz WiFi network remotely controlled by iPhone app ...,4.0 ,"When Etekcity offered me a discount coupon to evaluate this kit, for which I had an immediate need, I jumped at the opportunity to control outlets remotely from my iPhone. This product will only work on a 2.4 GHz WiFi network, nor will these outlets integrate with home management systems like Echo/Alexa and Google's Home. There's a QR code on the back of the product itself, which helps to locate the phone app which controls the outlets remotely. If you register and create an account with vesync.com you can also control these outlets from outside your network -- through the cloud. I wasn't expecting this feature, and am happy to have it. I even bought a couple more outlets to do more remote testing. An interesting feature is that the app supposedly logs power consumption and triggers alerts if consumption exceeds a number you set in the app. For one, you can use it to figure out how much electricity a particular appliance uses -- like the TV which still sucks up juice in dormant mode. There are curves and numbers on my graph, by the hour today, which make no sense to me, since I've had nothing plugged into it for a couple of days -- yet I have a rather dramatic graph of how much electricity ""leaked"" out today, all over my floor, apparently. Perhaps a future software update will fix this, for now, don't buy it for this feature alone. Although I have not tested it yet, the software allows you to time when the power switches on and off -- optionally repeating weekly, on selected days of the week. The outlet, while compact, can block other outlets, either side of it on a power strip. I have other Etekcity products in my home that are working well, so their stuff is generally reliable and work as advertised.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Actually 4 1/2 STARS.,4.0 ,"Transparency: I received this product at a reduced price. I would give them a 4 1/2 if possible, but the fact they are not compatible with Alexa, Google Home etc. deducts 1/2 a star even though they clearly state this in the product description. These smart plugs are definitely a lot smaller than their competitor's and have so many features for their size they are incredible. The simplified user interface is very easy to use and I love that they can be easily programmed to turn various items on and off to suit your schedule. The VeSync App is feature packed, versatile, and made connecting very easy. I love to be able to check the history and min/max of wattage use. I think the ability to monitor energy use is going to be a real money saver in the future. The plugs themselves just have the feel of being well made and if/when they are Smart Home compatible they are easily going to become best sellers. Let me add I have purchased many Etekcity products in the past and to date never been disappointed.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

"Want more of these, they are sweet",5.0 ,"These are really awesome for my home office, adding convenience at my desk I'm working need added lighting in different areas of the room without having everything on all at once. I just grab my phone swivel my chair to where I need to be and set the light in the area I need on. I've used these outlets for a very simple convenience but these outlets do so much more from within the application and can be used for much more than just controlling lights digitally on/off. You can monitor power use of devices within the outlet's amp rating. You can set the outlets on a timer to allow for security or even save power. I'm sure many ideas and issues around the home can be aided with these outlets. They were easy to setup packaged nicely and instructions were written professionally and in legible English. When I can I'm getting more and can definitely recommend them.

Simple automation in seconds,5.0 ,"As a standalone product impressed with the quality of the outlets and the capabilities of the mobile app. I particularly liked that within the app I was able to set up two lamps individually and then group them so that I could turn both on and off simultaneously. This feature works extremely well and I have integrated with Alexa, which recognizes the group name when I speak it. Other capabilities within the app include the ability to set a schedule, set timers and view consumption to name a few.

The configuration of this Etekcity plug is such that it fits into the bottom of a two plug outlet and leaves the top one available for other plugs.

"Excellent WiFi Smart Plugs, would definitely buy again!",5.0 ,"Great product. worked like a charm. Downloaded the app, plugged in the devices and they immediately acquired the WiFi signal. Now, they turn on my coffee pot and toaster. One caveat regarding the toaster! I tried to use it with my four toaster unit and it caused a problem. It says that it's good up to 1200 watts, so perhaps using both sides at once was too much wattage. Now I just use one side of the toaster at a time.

Simple design and packed with features.,4.0 ,I love these new app controlled wifi timer outlets. Much better than the standard timers plugs I have always used in the past because you can check up on these every so often and not just have faith that it's working. Also there have been times I wanted to change up a schedule when I was away from home or upstairs and not nearby the timer. I can do all of that now and monitor if the power is on or off.

I would buy more of these.,"Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Some of the cons can easily be fixed in an App update,3.0 ,"For a WiFi switch, I would have no problem give it 3 stars, meaning, it does the basic functionality OK. I would give it an extra half star if the setup supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks. I'm using Verizon Fios and have been using the same SSID for both 2.4 and 5 bands - had to use different SSID's for each network so that I can force my Iphone to connect to the 2.4 network to complete the configuration. I'd give it an extra half star if clear instructions were given on the phone app: there are two ""vesync"" apps in the ios app store. Only one works properly. The other one has long delay and once the WiFi module is unplugged and plugged back in, will permanently loose connection with the app unless re-configured. The one to avoid is ""Vesync SmartOutlet"". Use ""VesyncOutlet"" instead. Now on the advertised energy monitoring feature, it kinda works. Yes it monitors and displays power consumption in near real-time fashion (there's a ~10s delay in data refreshing), however the statistic display is completely untrustworthy. For example, it shows daily/monthly consumption is xxxW, and we know it should be xxxWH or xxxKWH. Well this could just be a typo, but when you look at the data in more detail, you'll wonder, how come a ~4W night light end up showing ~17W on the hourly chart? And when nothing is plugged into the WiFi plug, it shows around ~1W of power consumption - it's probably the power consumption of the plug itself and I appreciate the honesty here however, again, on the hourly chart, it shows around 3.5W. Something is screwed up here. Also, for the energy monitoring feature to work reliably, I'd highly suggest the vendor add a feature in the app to ""lock"" the on/off button. For example, when I use this thing to monitor my refrigerator, I don't want to inadvertently turn it off! All in all, this is an interesting product. If you just want to be able to turn it on and off remotely, it does the job well. Pros: Works well with WiFi connected phone, also works when the phone is on cellular network, even without an account. This means you can control the switch almost anywhere in the world. It also remembers the switch position on power outage. For example, if the switch was in On position before a power outage, the switch will automatically return to ""On"" once power resumes. Cons: Can only be configured on a 2.4G network. The key is to make sure your phone is connected to the 2.4G network. The energy monitoring feature only ""half works"". Also, there's no switch lock mode for energy monitoring. Some of the cons can easily be fixed in an App update. I look forward to it and once there, I'd be more than happy to buy more of these.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
"Small, convenient and reliable. Performs as expected (i.e., on/off)",5.0 ,"I've used the Android app when I first installed them and it works fine (if that's your thing). But, I really bought them to use with my Amazon Echo. I've installed 4 in my 'lazy' room where I stretch out on the sofa and turn lights off and on without getting up. You can name the devices and use Alexa (the Amazon Echo command name) to control them individually; ""Alexa, turn reading light off"", or combine them into 'groups' so that you can control them with one command; ""Alexa, turn all lights on"". They're especially handy when the lights are across the room or in otherwise hard to get places (up high, in a corner or behind furniture). I've only used them for light loads and never controlled anything with high power demands, so I can't testify to their robustness. Works for my needs though. So far so good.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
"Okay, cheap WiFi outlet plugs",3.0 ,"These are just okay. They seem like they'll be okay for what I wanted, controlling light times. But there is plenty of broken English which makes this product seem like a cheap knockoff. This also makes it hard to understand exactly what's happening in the app and setting it up. The other reason I don't think this deserves 5 stars is you can't have two of these in the same outlet. The things I like are that I can control this away from home, or from my bed instead of having to go physically change the timer. And I also like that it'll show me how much energy was used by this outlet. The app is very eh, it is not the most beautiful app and the hamburger menu is actually not a hamburger menu. Personally, I wouldn't order these again.

"Great for setting timer, monitoring consumption, controlling via app",5.0 ,"I got one of these a while back, and just picked up two more. They work great and are a great price! Setup was easy - just downloaded the app and followed the instructions. We use it on an air filter in our bedroom. Before getting this plug, we were always forgetting to turn the filter off during the day (we wanted it on at night as a ""noise machine""). With this plug I set the filter to go on at 9:30 PM every night and off at 8:30 AM every morning. After a quick setup, I can now tell time by it, as it turns on and off every day exactly as scheduled. It's also been great to check the power consumption on this, so I know how much money I'm now saving by having it turn off automatically every morning. Note - I haven't used this with Alexa or devices like that, though I believe it is compatible. Pros: -Easy setup -Timer function -Power consumption monitoring -Small enough to allow second outlet plug to be used Cons: -Minor thing, but the app has a number of spelling errors throughout its menus -Not sure you could fit two of these on one outlet - haven't tried it yet since I am still awaiting my second one To sum up - this is a great gadget for a great price.

From the start it has configured ok but then does not respond to either the products app or the Alexa app/voice control. Every now and then it responds correctly, but a majority of the time it will respond for a split second and then revert back (i.e. if a light is plugged in to the outlet it'll flicker on or off but then revert to the opposite of what you were commanding). I have tried resetting and re-configuring multiple times. No success. The outlet is essentially worthless. My rating is given the fact that I have had a 50% success rate thus far. I have only tried two outlets, but still. 1 for 2 is not a great outcome for me. If you want to roll the dice and hope for two good ones, you may luck out and decide to give a better rating accordingly. I unfortunately purchased the pair a few months ago and just this week finally found a reason to use them. Now that I am outside of the 30 day return window I will have to pursue a replacement with the seller. I haven't found an easy way to initiate this process yet so I'm guessing I may have to call their customer service during regular ""business"" hours. Hopefully that process will go seamlessly, albeit a bit annoying to not have an easy online approach to the process. If my rating changes after working thru this process I will update my review accordingly.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Great value and easy to use WiFi Smart Plugs,5.0 ,"Wow! These are my first smart plugs, and I am impressed. Compact design, easy to install and use VeSync app via the Google Play store, and easy app syncing with Amazon Alexa app for voice control. I did find that configuring one outlet at a time (only having one with power to it) worked best when setting up with VeSync. I also named each easy to remember names in VeSync for easy voice control with Alexa. I noticed that you can also set timers on these which would be nice for lights I currently have on old bulky timer devices, or even holiday lights. I may be buying more of these if they continue to function well for me.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Easy to setup,5.0 ,"Affordable wireless controller for Alexa was what we needed and thats what we received! Easy to setup, easy to use, and very programmable via the App. Although it can easily monitor power usage too (a really cool feature) we dont utilize that feature. Our specific need at this time was as follows: We are remodeling half of our house on the first floor. Because it is stripped of sheetrock and all previous lamps and ceiling lights, we currently have a couple strings of utility lights hanging throughout the ""reconstruction"" area. We have Etekcity Smart Plug Outlets hooked up to these lights since it is very dark where they are hanging. We have each outlet in a group called ""construction lights"". Whenever we need to pass through or work in the are we just tell Alexa to turn on the ""construction lights"".","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
100%product!!!,5.0 ,I am impressed with this product for the week i have used it. Super easy to connect ( make sure to download app first). Looks great and strong too. The part I loved the most is that on the app you can set times on and off.

These are AWESOME!! At my house we have christmas lights ...,5.0 ,"These are AWESOME!! At my house we have christmas lights up year round and this allows my wife and I to turn them on wherever! Its nice when we come home in the evening we can turn the lights on before we go in the house and we can turn them off from the comfort of our own bed! These products will do more than christmas lights though, you can hook up a normal lamps to them, a TV, pretty much whatever you would like to control using your phone. It's nice too to able to see no matter where you are in the world that has internet - if those outlets are on are not. These things also feel like they are quality made and will last for a while. I didn't have any issues setting them up but a friend of mind had a little issue, but it could have been his phone and it eventually worked anyway! I recommend these!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
"Good, but not ready for prime time",3.0 ,"I was looking for a cheaper alternative to my WeMo Insight Switches. I have the Etekcity regular non-WiFi remote switches and they are super solid, so I thought I'd give these a try. Bottom line: These will work, but their app is a mess. In time, I think they can be just as good as WeMo, but this isn't ready for Prime Time. If you're just using them for basic on and off, or with an Echo Dot or Google Home, you'll be happy. But things like the timer and schedule simply don't work. (Timer only works if you leave the app open and running in the foreground...what?!) With some app development, I can see these being just as good as WeMo devices though. And once they get some IFTTT support, even better! Just remember: you get what you pay for.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
"Simple Setup, Easy to Use",5.0 ,"I purchased 2 sets of these plugs (4 total plugs) so I could use my Echo to voice control several older lamps in inconvenient places. You must install a free vendor app on a smart device to configure the plugs and the app has simple step-by-step guides for setup and Echo integration. The plugs were simple to set up on my local Wi-Fi network, easy to integrate into the Echo system for voice control, and easy to set up a simple plain language name for each plug. They work exactly as advertised. The plugs allow you to turn on and off devices, no dimming. You can define schedules to turn on and off devices and the management app can also report usage times and power usage.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Works OK for Me,4.0 ,"I had a difficult time trying to connect the first smart plug to our wifi system. I followed instructions; retried things, reset it etc. FINALLY, it connected to the wifi. Connecting the second plug was a snap. It was very easy to set these up with Amazon Echo. It works well so far. The reason for 4 stars is because of the size of the plugs. They are quite large in my opinion.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Can't get any easier than this folks!,5.0 ,"Absolutely simple to ""install"" and control. I purchased these ""Smart Plugs"" as an initial look at Etekcity products...and am very IMPRESSED. The quality of their iPhone App shows that they care about the consumer experience -- and that is absolutely vital for the more complex products that will allow major control of our electronic devices throughout the home. Looking forward to buying other EteckCity products.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
but they are working great for me,5.0 ,"I got this because I wanted to hook it up to my bedroom light, and then link it to Alexa. On the app reviews for VESync, or whatever it is called, it has average 3-4 star ratings. I was apprehensive about that. I also read how these have died on people. I can't speak for them, but they are working great for me. I've linked it to Alexa and now can tell her to turn on and off the ""room light."" She says ""ok"" as she turns if off, which I thought was kinda cool. Anyway, YMMV due to what I've read about other buyers. For me I loved it and it has been working great.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Best bang for my buck!,5.0 ,"Love this product! The best thing about this is the ability to control it with alexa (and the cross platform app) and it supports upto 1200 w! (I found out the hard way :/ but they're sending me another one so they're the best!) controlling your lights / electronic appliances has never been so easy! Amazon had bundled ""2 hue lights + hub + echo dot"" for the same price as ""4 of these + echo dot"" these can not only control lights but other stuff too so this is wayy better","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
These were pretty easy to setup with Echo Dot,5.0 ,These were pretty easy to setup with Echo Dot. I ordered 4 of them but only 3 of them work. I think the 4th one is defective. Not sure what to do since they were sold in pairs. Other than that I love the product. The company sent me an additional 2 outlets free of charge and they also credited my account $20.00! Great customer service! I would def. recommend these outlets.,"Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
I love the future.,5.0 ,I have four of these linked with an amazon echo. Previously I purchased two that worked great. But then I ordered another “set” and received only one... and when I introduced them something went wrong and then two of the plugs wouldn’t keep their settings. But I was able to return them without issue for a refund. So I bought a new set and this time they’re all working flawlessly. I have an old house with few overhead lights and I was tired of crossing a dark room to turn on the lights. I think these will help prolong having to hire an electrician. :),"Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Almost perfect.,4.0 ,"It works! I wanted the simplicity of being able to turn on and off devices without it needing to be a smart device (i.e. - smart bulb). In addition, the cost savings. The only issue I had was with setup via app. The app kept indicating it did not locate but when I returned to home screen the device showed. At first I assumed it did not properly pair. Upon testing the found device I found that it indeed did despite the error messages on app. Lastly, the other reason I chose this one over the numerous ones available was the size. Not excessively bulky that it interferes with other outlet. Depending on how you have your outlets set up meaning 3rd hole up or down or to the side it worked with utilizing the bottom outlet (in a standard 2 plug outlet) freeing up the top outlet.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Great buy!! Won't be disappointed!,5.0 ,"For the $$ buy it! Works great! Software is easy to setup and control. The app could use a bit of tweaking (polishing) to make more feature friendly. How and where information is displayed mostly. Maybe the option to select different units and more features in action logs and notifications. But I'm nitpicking here. Truthfully it's super simple to setup and control. Great product really, providing it lasts.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Great WiFi outlets!,5.0 ,"I ordered, and promptly received, two Etekcity WiFi outlets. Packaging was perfect and instructions were simple to follow. So far, both outlets have worked flawlessly. So much that I have recently order two more. These things are kind of addictive once you start using them! Be aware that if you put the WiFi outlet on the top outlet it will partially cover the lower outlet. Not an issue in most applications. The app works great and the schedule and power use functions are very convienient. Great product!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
VERY Easy Setup,5.0 ,"This is a really great smart plug. I bought them to replace another one I had because I could no longer use them over the internet. Setup on these was MUCH easier than the other ones I had, so they were literally up and running in about 60 seconds. Plus, they're relatively small so you can still use the second plug in the outlet you're using.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
and this smart plug Surprisingly outperforms them at a fraction of the ...,5.0 ,"I've tried several other brands, notably TP-Link and Wemo, and this smart plug Surprisingly outperforms them at a fraction of the price! I really like how small It is - much less noticeable than the others. Another positive is the app which is simple to use. No need to get the big name brands as this does a great job.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
A text option would be better. Also,4.0 ,"Had difficulty connecting using the preferred method. After many attempts settled on APN approach. One problem is the limited time to enter code sent via email. The code expires prior to mail arriving. A text option would be better. Also, there seems to be no way to delete a schedule once added to a device. Finally, they work and perform as advertised. I may add additional units. You might consider a partner in Lutron/Caseta.

Smart plug for monitoring power consumption,5.0 ,"I've been searching for a good set of smart outlets for quite some time. I wanted a smart plug that was small enough to occupy one outlet and gives me real-time power consumption estimates and cost projections. I decided to give these a try and was not disappointed. I currently use it to monitor power consumption of a small home server. My server peaks at 525 watts and this outlet allows up to 1000 watts. When my server is under full load, I've noticed that the plug gets slightly warm to the touch but it does not worry me at all. I placed it about 25-feet away from my wireless router in a small room separated by concrete walls. I was afraid that there would be range issues but it worked flawlessly! I love the tools they provide in the app and I use them all the time. Pros: 1. Small and asthetically pleasing design 2. Decent range 3. Analytical charts for cost projections 4. Real-time power usage monitor 5. Easy to set up and use 6. Timer 7. Ability to turn on/off switch from anywhere in the world! Cons: 1. No alexa/siri/google assistant support. It would be extremely nice if Etekcity would develop software for these voice assistants. How hard could it be, right? I would recommend this product to everyone! Get yourself a couple of these and find that electronic device that it sending up your bill! Of course I also recommend for the ability to remotely control your outlet and all the other things I listed above. Disclaimer- I received this product at a discounted price of around $10. However, I would definitely make another purchase at the full retail price.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
"Easy Instructions, and works great!",5.0 ,Etekcity has treated me right with all their products and their customer support. I have been wanting to get some smart outlets and saw these. Instructions included a QR code to get the app. After downloading the app (VesyncOutlet) synced right up. Couldn't have been easier. These are 10 amps units and work great for the lamps I am using. Haven't played with programming settings in the app yet.

Really good value but could be better.,4.0 ,These sockets work great. The app is a little poor and some of the help language simply doesn't make sense but it is easy enough to figure out. One thing the software misses is the ability to on/off with sunrise/sunset - which would be an easy fix if only it was linked to IFTTT but it doesn't.,"Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Works great!,5.0 ,"I have previously purchased two big name smart plugs from local store, but found them not worth the big price tags. I wanted to try something similar but with lower price. After long research, I finally settled on these plugs. To my surprise, they are easier to use than brand-name ones. So far, they have been very reliable through remote control from several states away (actually almost across the country). The only inconvenience I found (not sure if it's just me) is that I could only set up to control these plugs via one device (it wouldn't allow two smart devices to pass the configuration step). Other than that, I still think they worth it.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Winner,5.0 ,"Purchased two as a ""test run"". Worked great right out of the box. Configuration was a snap. Controlled via my Echo Dot using the free VeSync skill. What's not to like?

Great customer service! Changing it to 5 stars!,5.0 ,"The pairing to my wifi was not the most easiest process with my phone and the plug does not reliably turn off on the first try. As soon as I press ""off"" from the app, it turns off for a split second and turns back on. This was incredibly frustrating especially if its tied to your Alexa as you have to keep telling it to turn off but it eventually does on average after three tries or three presses. Update: 11/26/17 Etekcity sent in a replacement and this one now works perfectly. Awesome prompt customer service! Setting this thing is up is only reliable when doing the access point route. Press and hold it for 10 seconds, connect to the plug wirelessly and return to the app. Input your wifi credentials and you should be good to go!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Works well. Easy set up. No google assisstant though.,4.0 ,"[Original 1 star rating] Package of two - both worked for about 30 seconds, then stopped working. I can turn them ""on"" and ""off"" with the app or the button on the device, BUT no power comes out of the outlet. Gambled with the cheap option and it didn't pay off this time... I wish they did work though - the app was actually fairly decent and setup was easy. Too bad the physical device doesn't work. [Update - 4 stars] After writing my original review Etekcity reached out and replaced my broken outlets at no cost. I'm happy to say they're working great! Set up with wifi and Alexa was easy, and now when I'm washing dishes my sink light can be turned on/off hands free. I wish these worked with Google Assistant too. Also, not rated for high wattage items such as space heaters, so I went with the wemo outlets for that.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
super easy to use with Alexa,5.0 ,"Super easy to get set up (the only pain was because you have to get an app and an account... but you can't really grocery shop without that now, eh?)

Turn lights on or off from anywhere,5.0 ,"DISCLAIMER: I received these at a reduced price I've had these for a couple months now and they are working as expected. I was at first concerned when the limited documentation indicated that they required a 2.4G connection, but that is only for initial setup. Your controlling device can be connected back to 5G after the device has been added to your network and will still turn the device on and off. It would be nice if the scheduled event times could be varied by about 5 - 10 minutes to introduce some randomness to the schedule, but overall I enjoy being able to set a schedule for each device and to be able to override from my mobile device with a simple touch.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Good but a little bigger then I anticipated,4.0 ,"These are pretty cool once you get them working. They take up a little more space then I had anticipated (stick out from socket).

Limited setup and networking options. Poor app support,2.0 ,"Very limited setup options. Cannot get outlet setup on my secondary ""extension"" network. Setup only works on a network which has internet access also. Would be super useful if you could configure the outlet to connect to a different SSID than what your phone is connected to, but you CAN'T. Can't manually enter SSID to connect to, even after it's already connected to change the network it uses. ""APN setup mode"" is also wonky and doesn't work. Wasted too much time trying to set this up on my secondary network. It simply won't work.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
"Great Product, Terrible App",3.0 ,"Trying to setup this device with the app has been a nightmare. First of all there are 2 apps in the android store, one works and the other one doesn't, so if you choose the wrong one at first like I did then you will be spending even more time on setup because it doesn't work at all. Once I did download the correct app I found that it keeps locking up when trying to add a new device. I had to restart the app, clear the cache, do a force stop, numerous times just to get the device to show up in my list. What should be a simple 3 min setup process took me roughly around 30 mins. Once the device is setup it is easy to use and the app works great. Getting in touch with support was a pleasant experience, they are very helpful and very patient with helping with the setup process. It was also very easy to add to my Echo Dot, but you do have to use the company app to setup the device first. If and when they fix the app I would recommend this product to anyone.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

This is amazingly convenient and easy to set up!,5.0 ,"I love them! I thought it might be complicated yo set up, but the app makes it easy to pop a plug in and get going in a couple minutes with all the outlets linked and named. The instructions didn't say anything about adding a skill to my echo, but the skill is the same name as the app. That skill let me add the plugs to my echo and my echo even lets me group plugs together.

Remote control non-programmable appliances!!,5.0 ,"They work perfectly! It's pretty nifty to be able to remote-control an appliance, or to set up automated rules so that your coffee maker will turn on automatically at 6am even though it doesn't have a clock. The ONE thing I would request is for the scheduled actions not to have to be both actions (turn on and turn off), instead, for example, to turn off the power to the appliance at 7am every day.

Works great for the price and size,5.0 ,"I bought these because they were smaller in form factor than a lot of other smart plugs. I use it for an outdoor plug that is on the patio in a covered socket. It works great! It's able to fit into the covered socket with an extension cord so it's fully sheltered from the elements. It's small enough that it still keeps the other outlet accessible. I was skeptical about the app and it's ability to connect with Alexa, but the instructions were great and works like a charm! Delivered as advertised with a good price. The only complaint (but likely user error) is that the timer/schedule mode hasn't taken into account daylight savings time and I'm unsure how to fix the clock for the device.

Neither one would paid with my main network and so I set up a specific 2.4GHz network for these and still nothing. One wouldn't go into APN mode no matter how long your pressed the power button. The other would go into APN mode but would never pair.,"Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Awesome!,4.0 ,"Pretty cool outlets! I know some folks have had issues. I think they just didn't pay close attention to the disclaimers on the description (just like me initially). I had some issues getting them up and running because I didn't closely follow the directions. Once I got my router squared away though, they linked right up. I've been using them with Alexa for a good while now with absolutely no issues. The only disappointment is that you can't sink them with SmartThings. Getting this fixed would take these to a 5 out of 5 rating!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
These things are great!!!,5.0 ,"I love them so much I'm ordering more. I have them set up with Alexa so I can ""turn in lights"" (all of them in the house) or turn on each one individually. Super handy for when I'm coming home in the dark and forgot to turn on a light. I hope to eventually have everything in the house on these. It's nice being able to see how much power stuff uses too. I tried it w/ my coffee machine and it worked great. I set IFTTT to have it go off when my Alexa alarm fired. We're living in amazing times. :-p","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Very easy to set up,5.0 ,"I received these plugs today so I can't speak to durability but they were very easy to set up. You just download an app, sign up for an account, and enter your Wi-Fi password. You can rename them to make it easier to turn the plugs on and off using your Alexa or through the app. The app also allows you to set a schedule or timer. Very happy with these plugs. Just bought two more!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
A+,5.0 ,"Installed easily. Works flawlessly with VeSync app, Alexa, and Reverb app which is a limited version of Alexa for your phone. Reverb is a must have since it gives you Alexa-like voice control on your phone for smart wifi devices making away-from-home control even easier. (In fact, after schedule set up, you can remove the app and just use Reverb.) The only feature missing is an one-touch/one-command way to temporarily suspend scheduling. We will see about durability. Update: after a power outage, they worked fine with app, but I had to disable and re-enable Alexa skill.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Super easy to use,5.0 ,"Super easy to use, fantastic well designed software and a price point that is hard to beat. The units seem well built and are durable.

These work great and are SURPRISINGLY easy to setup on your network,5.0 ,"These work great and are SURPRISINGLY easy to setup on your network. They are also easy to edit if you want to plug a different appliance into it like a fan vs a lamp. I do have to repeat a command to get one of them to shut off, but that might be an issue on my end with my modem as my signal isn't great. A must if you have a device or us your phone and have always wanted to have voice commands for your stuff but don't have a million dollars to spend on a house that's got its own network.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Easier to install than I expected... or was led to believe,5.0 ,"Despite some of the reviews that said these were difficult to install, I found this pretty straighforward to plug in, discover and link to our Amazon Alexa network. We will likely buy more as the price is right or comes down. I used an android phone and hooked up two lamps for convenience and to have timers when we're away for the weekend to turn lights on and off.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Worked perfectly and easy to set up,4.0 ,"Easy to set up and worked perfectly with my Echo Dot. Only reason I don't give it a 5 is that you have to set it up first with a 3rd party and then connect that product with your Alexa skills. That also means that if I buy other products not on this platform (VeSync), I could control them all with Alexa, but I'd have to use multiple apps on my phone if I wanted to use that interface for control.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
Recommend highly over WeMo,5.0 ,"After spending an hour on the phone with tech support at WeMo, I couldn't get the WeMo plug to connect to my Wifi and I waited days for a ""level II tech"" to call me back.

Love these!!,5.0 ,"I had initially purchased two TP-Link smart plugs. One was defective. Additionally, they were a bit tricky to install. So I got back on Amazon and read the reviews.

Quit after 1 month,5.0 ,"I thought these were great at first. I had it connected to a 5000 btu a/c so I could remotely control the start and stop. Worked for 1 month.

Etekcity Smart Plug Mini Outlet (2 Pack),4.0 ,"Updating this, 08/26/17... If I were rating the customer service, it'd be 5 stars. I received an email from the company, the same night that I originally posted my review. They said they wanted to send out a replacement, and they showed up a few days later. The new outlets set up perfectly. I set up both outlets as a group, so I'd be able to turn both on and odd simultaneously. When turning off, both will initially respond, but one will instantly turn back on. I need to command this one off, by itself. I also started getting notifications that the outlets were offline, then a few minutes later they'd be online. One morning, I received about 50 notifications of this occurring from around 5:30am to 8:15 am. This occurred several days in a row, then suddenly stopped. All occurrences happened early am. In all, they seem to work pretty decently. If I could rate half stars, they'd receive a 4.5. I noticed the number of ratings more than doubled, since I purchased my original set. I also noticed the price increased by about 30%. Original review... One works flawlessly, one won't connect... it slowly flashes blue. At one point, I believe I saw the light turn yellow, then purple. Not sure F that means anything. I tried the troubleshooting steps: - unplugged it and plugged it back in. I left it unplugged for about 5 hours - reset modem - held power button for well over the recommended 20 seconds, but the light keeps slowly flashing blue. I'll contact the seller, before I return it.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

"Good price, great customer service",5.0 ,"Love these. Super easy to set up with the app. Once they went nonresponsive, and I had to reconfigure them in the vesync app before my Echo could interact with them again, but I think that was because my internet connection at home went down - the only reason I partially blame this on the plug is because the wifi network was still up, and I think they should be able to recover from dropped internet as long as they've been connected to the wifi network the whole time. It's worth noting that (perhaps obviously) the form factor is large enough that if you put it in the top outlet, it blocks the bottom one. So, you have to place it in the bottom one. Since they're 3 prong, they have to be oriented upright, so you can't use two in one outlet. No big deal, most are like that unless they're specifically marketed to be small form factor. EDIT: After not even two weeks of using these, I've had to revise my rating from 4 stars to 2. Twice now the devices have gone nonresponsive. The first time I thought it was just my wifi network causing issues. The second time now, the wifi network has had no problems, the units have just spontaneously stopped working again. I like the plugs when they're working, but it's not worth having to reconfigure it every few days to keep them working. EDIT: After my last edit, etekcity reached out to me almost instantly and send me replacement units. Since then, I've had no issues! Fantastic customer service!","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

Works as advertised...,5.0 ,"I love these things. I had absolutely no problems setting them up. You simply scan the code on the back of one of the plugs using your phone and it takes you right to the phone app. You need to create an account but that was no big deal. You create the account and they email you a code to verify your email is correct. You plug the devices into outlets, open the app, log in, click discover devices. It will then ask for your wireless passcode so it can program it into each of the devices. It finds the devices, you edit each of their names and boom, you have automated lights. The app even gives you very simple instructions on how to then connect your Amazon Echo to it so you can control it with your voice. WITH YOUR VOICE!!! How freaking cool is that!!! I now walk into my dark house after work and say, Alexa, turn on all lights and BOOM, my living room and back room lamps turn on and I don't have to walk into a dark room. I can also control each one separately. I say Alexa, turn off back light and it just turns that one off. I absolutely love it...

Outstanding Smart Device and Works w/o Issue!,5.0 ,"Had issue with this device not working properly with Amazon Echo the first 2 weeks after the installation. I was a bit frustrated and thought I bought a POS. They must have updated the driver, because we had this unit for 4 months now and it's been solid. Let see how long it'll last. I'll keep update every 6 months or until it fail. Foe now it works great! I can control it using the Android app when I'm away from home. If you have an indoor security camera, this product makes great compliment. It's nice to turn on/off light by giving verbal command to Alexa/Echo from any room (using multiple Echo devices and multiple smart plugs).","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

Not worth it.,1.0 ,"This plug is a great size and price is acceptable but it's functionality is seriously lacking. It is supposed to have a timer function and the ability to use multiple devices for control. The timer does not actually turn on/off/on the plug as described. Over several days, the app would claim the outlet cut power but never actually did. Good thing no device posing a fire hazard was plugged in. Also, directions are seriously lacking. Users are supposed to be able to ""share"" outlets to be controlled on multiple devices. Unfortunately, there is no option to ""share"" in the VeSync app or on the device itself. Support on the website is a joke and does not work. No contact information is available and no additional support is available. The attached instructions are all you have to configure and use this device. My best guess is Etekcity is a small tech company that has either given up or just cannot produce a solid product. I could run a better business with my eyes closed. Steer clear of this company and find a different smart plug.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"

Complete Failure! Does not join network nor does it stay OFF after power outage,1.0 ,"I bought this product for one feature only, quote from the product description: ""Outlets remain off after a power outage to save energy"". I did not care about remotely controlling the outlet, I just wanted it to stay off after a power outage. In short, it does NOT do that. It returns to the state previously active before the outage. If it was ON it will go back to ON after the outage or stay OFF if it was OFF. That is not what I needed and was said I would get. I was actually never able to add the device to my network either. I am running multiple 2.4GHz and 5 GHz networks. Of course, I was trying to join my 2.4 GHz networks as this is all it supports. It failed when trying to set it up with steady blue light after plugging it in and it failed with the forced more where you hold the toggle button for 10+ second to get the blue light blinking. I wonder if my WPA2-Personal encryption is the problem but it did never succeed to join my network. In short, this purchase was a complete failure and I am returning this.","Etekcity WiFi Smart Plug Mini Outlet with Energy Monitoring (2 Pack), Works with Amazon Alexa Echo, No Hub Required, 1 Minute to Set Up, White"
"Not ""Smart""",2.0 ,"Pretty disappointed. Perhaps I was looking for something else. These are not ""smart"" plugs. They're basically wifi connected timers. I have Wemo plugs that will adjust for time changes, sundown/sun up changes, etc. These turn on and off at a time you set. The interface is clunky and not intuitive and the instructions appear to have been poorly translated from another language. The ""energy monitor"" is a fairly worthless function, IMO.

Good bye WeMo,5.0 ,"I used WeMo for 6 years and hated it's slow sluggish response. The WeMo app is a piece of crap where it constantly freezes and fails to find devices. WeMo device themselves drops wifi connection aggressively. This new smart plug immediately connected to the wifi in 3 seconds and was ready in 4 seconds. WeMo took me 5 minutes to setup where this took 7 seconds max. I installed the app login and adding new device just took me 7 seconds (warning there are lots of fake ones with the same name and the QR codes takes you to the wrong one). Then in Alaxa app I added the ""Skills"" called ""Smart Life"" from Alaxa skills market. Then after 20 seconds the linking was done. After scan it was all ready and connected. Both with the Android app and with Alaxa training on and off is 8 times faster then WeMo. Sooooooooo happy I bought this.

Great smart plugs at a great price,4.0 ,"I'm giving a pretty high review because I easily set up both of these using the default approach, and the price is good for the feature set. I downloaded the Smart Life app on iOS, created an account (yes, it requires your phone number...I'm not too troubled by that). I had one problem giving my full Wifi SSID password, it was too long to enter into the Smart Life app on iOS. So I attached these to my guest network which has a shorter password (and probably a good idea anyway). If not for this one problem I might give a 5-star review. There was also a backup connection approach which makes these their own temporary WiFi AP (a lot of devices do this as an alternative connection means). I did not need to use that, as the ""plan A"" approach worked fine for me. I renamed each of these to a good straightforward name and enabled the Alexa Smart Life smart home skill, and discovered the devices. All of this worked flawlessly and I can use the app or Alexa to control these. The Smart Life skill also supports IFTTT for the more advanced home automation tinkerers. My only concern, I guess, is that these require a cloud platform to stay running for them to continue to work - and that means ongoing costs. If the company ever decides to shut this down, these no longer function. Although made in China my two units both connect to EC2 instances in US-West-2 on the MQTT port. You can easily check this by checking your local router to find the assigned IP, then search in the list of open ports what target IP and port they connect to, and then run a ""whois"" to find ownership of the related IP block.

Life changer,5.0 ,"Imagine this, every morning you wake up to the aroma of your favorite coffee brewing. You walk downstairs, the morning news is on and toasts popping out fresh.

Works great,5.0 ,"Paired up easily. Set up a schedule to control some lamps, no additional fees or purchases. Work's with Alexa. Only drawback is you're adding two more devices to your router. Which can be a problem for families or homes with multiple devices connected to the WiFi and cheap routers. You're at the mercy of your WiFi network range as well.

Glitchy,3.0 ,"Edit 11/11/17: Downgraded to 3 stars after having used these for some time. I still like it, and think it's still value for money considering the other products out there. The issue I'm having is it's glitchy. Sometimes goes offline for no reason, requiring me to unplug and replug. And the timer function is only about 80% reliable- sometimes plain does not turn on. Have not identified any trends, it's a cr@pshoot- some day lights turn on and some days they done. And often unplugging and replugging rectifies it for a few weeks. The Alexa function and phone control seem to be reliable so long as plug is online- but I wouldn't trust the timer for vital systems. Original post: Frankly, I'm blown away and one part of me is still waiting for something to fail but it hasn't yet. Cheap, small, simple device with quick set up. Just plug it in, download the app to phone, connect the two and you're good to go. The app allows for basic functions like timer etc; scenes that can be triggered by sunset/sunrise, humidity etc- but have not experimented with these functions yet. Once you assign a name for each plug, works seamlessly with Alexa. And for less than 30 bucks for two, seems like a bargain compared to the other branded ones. Instruction manual wasn't helpful, with the usual bad English, but it's not hard to figure out. Bought a 2nd set.",Wifi Smart Plug Set of 2 Mini Smart Outlet Works with Amazon Alexa Remote Control By Smart Phone from Anywhere Anytime (2 Packs)

Really loves it!,5.0 ,"Absolutely love those smart plug!! it saves my life. I am a super lazy person, now I can control my room light in my bed by using the App. And I can control my room light even if I am at work or anywhere outside. The quality is good! I have used those plugs for more than 1 month, everything works fine! I am thinking to buy more products!",Wifi Smart Plug Set of 2 Mini Smart Outlet Works with Amazon Alexa Remote Control By Smart Phone from Anywhere Anytime (2 Packs)
"Great plugs, not-so-good app",4.0 ,"The plugs work great and you can't beat the price (I paid $22 for 2). My only complaint is with the app. The ONE thing I wanted to be able to do was have my lights turn on at sunset, and then off at a set time, say 11:30 pm (like I can do with my WeMo plugs and the WeMo app). I tried everything I could think of but could never make this happen. In fact, I could never get the on/off at sunset/sunrise function to work at all. To create a sunrise/sunset ""scene,"" the app needs to know your location so it knows what time sunrise/sunset is. When I tried to do this, it pre-populate my location (which was off by about 30 miles, but that shouldn't make a difference). However, as soon as I saved the scene, I'd then get a ""Location Obtaining Failed"" message. Again, tried everything I could think of, but could never seem to get it to recognize my location - maybe that's why the sunrise/sunset function won't work -- very frustrating. Also, it did take a bit of work to get the plugs synched with my wifi. When you go to set up your plug in the app, there's ""regular"" mode and ""AP"" mode -- I have no idea what the difference is, but ""regular"" is the faster, recommended way. I tried that 3-4 times with no luck. I then tried the AP mode, which requires a few more steps, and that did the trick. I have no idea why I needed ""AP"" over regular -- and the instructions are useless -- but if you're trying to connect and keep getting the ""connection failed"" message, try the AP mode (you can select the AP mode in the top-right of the Smart Home app when adding a device). If all you want to do is be able to turn the plugs on/of via the app (or via Alexa), or schedule the plug to turn on or off at specific times, these plugs can't be beat. Unfortunately, the wonkiness and lack of flexibility of the app makes be deduct a star.",Wifi Smart Plug Set of 2 Mini Smart Outlet Works with Amazon Alexa Remote Control By Smart Phone from Anywhere Anytime (2 Packs)

"If you survive the setup, IT WORKS!",4.0 ,"I bought this to run a grow light on a set schedule for indoor winter gardening in Alaska. Got the set of two so, I'd have an extra to find a creative use for. Function is 5 stars. App is 5 stars. Setup was 3 stars. Setup was not easy and took multiple attempts. (my tech level: geek - all my PC's are home builds, I'm the guy my friends and family calls for tech support, I know my way around software, firmware, routers, and networking) After several failed attempts following the ""Engrish"" steps on the included instructions for ""easy mode (recommended)"", I decided I WAS following the directions correctly, but it just wasn't going to work. Then, I attempted the ""AP mode"" setup (if EZ mode fails), where you connect your phone to the device directly via wifi to bootstrap it into submission to your router. That pathway worked on the first attempt, further re-enforcing my opinion that ""easy mode"" probably doesn't work that well (also saw other reviews here with similar results). At least one of the set-up algorithms worked, or I'd be sending it back.",Wifi Smart Plug Set of 2 Mini Smart Outlet Works with Amazon Alexa Remote Control By Smart Phone from Anywhere Anytime (2 Packs)

Great programmable lighting and electrical plugs.,5.0 ,"Waited to hook up all four and watch for a few days and so, great! App for IOS is easy as can be. I need to experiment and see what happens in a power loss before we go away. A question was emailed me by Amazon before these arrived. CAN THEY FIT WITH ANOTHER PLUG? I ordered these because they appeared to allow room for the other outlet. This turned out to be true, only a larger head plug like the angled ones on some surge protectors do not allow both to fit. Anyway, I'll update this if plugs fail but so far they look like an excellent investment. Don't try to read the skimpy instructions, just scan the code with the phones you want to program and it's pretty intuitive (for iPhone, at least) from there. the program looks like it can consolidate smart feature programming and makes it easy to review current schedules by day of week.",Wifi Smart Plug Set of 2 Mini Smart Outlet Works with Amazon Alexa Remote Control By Smart Phone from Anywhere Anytime (2 Packs)
Is This a Chinese IOT Trojan Horse?,2.0 ,"Works OK so far, but this device worries me from a security point of view. Cheap but scary. I disabled all the Android Smart Life app's permissions in ""Settings->Apps"" after configuring the device. Why did the app literally need every permission known to man on my Android phone to simply configure the device? What REALLY worries me is the amount of data the device moves to/from The Cloud---constantly. Is it eavesdropping on my local LAN traffic? Or, is it a Trojan Horse waiting for instructions from hackers lurking in the shadows in another country? Over the last 7 days the device downloaded 18 Mbytes and uploaded 135 MBytes of data (see photo)! More than a bit worrisome. The rate has slowed down to ~120 Kbyte/6 MBytes down/up per 24 hour period over the last few days, but what possibly can be going on?

Works perfectly with SmartLife app *and* Alexa,5.0 ,"I wanted to be able to have smart plugs that a) kept a regular schedule and b) I could also turn on and off both individually and in groups via my Echo device. These plugs are perfect for that. Download the SmartLife app to your phone (requires you to set up an account for controlling your devices while off your home network, uses your phone number as your account name), plug it in, pair to app, rename if desired. I set up the schedule in the SmartLife app. Then, from the Alexa app, enable the SmartLife link, and you can trigger Alexa to find the devices. After this, your Alexa can turn the plugs on and off by the names you gave them. You can also setup group(s) in the Alexa app and control multiple plugs with one command. I got these specifically for the lights on my aquariums. The schedule runs on its own and I can turn on/off the lights plugged in to one plug or all the plugs at once.

I understand that the unit obviously couldn't work if the switch is off, but I'd like to be able to come into the room and flip the switch to turn them on. Instead when you flip the switch the lights stay off, then you have to wait about 10 seconds and ask Alexa to turn on the lights. Kind of obnoxious. I wanted to be able to flip them on with the switch, then after rading in bed or something be able to turn them off via voice control.

It makes me satisfied. Recommended,5.0 ,"Two weeks ago I bought this smart plug, Because I will leave home after a few days.

I'd love to leave the pattern, I can set a time interval, during which time I can open and close the fixture at any time to improve the security. I often go out, so it is really great for me. I can use my cloud camera, and it would be easy to see my house condition.

initially unreliable but the newer version seems to be OK,4.0 ,"Updated 11/6/17: The vendor sent me a new unit as promised, and it works much better. I have an older unit which still drops out (unreachable) at times, but this newer release is working fine. We had a power failure and it threw off the scheduled actions for both units. I reset and ""rediscovered"" one (requiring me to enter in the schedule again) to fix it, the other I unplugged for a few days and that seemed to make it happier. Now, after DST, they haven't gotten the time right (they are still off by an hour) and I don't know how to resolve that issue either. The software makes no provision for that, not that I can find. That's really the only fault that remains to be resolved, and I can just reset the units and ""discover"" them again like I did after the power failure. If not for that, it would be five stars. Original review: I've bought two of these things now, different brands, different sellers, but they appear to be identical, with identical packaging, appearance, the same horribly translated user guide and basically the same performance. Made in China, natch. So why the three stars? Because I'm feeling generous today, that's why. These things are difficult to setup the first time, largely because of the unhelpful instructions. However, once you get past that, you can get your Echo to learn the new skill (easy) and control it from your phone or Echo. Google home is not supported. It works great until it stops working. I've had both units stop responding. I don't know why. Sometimes you have to reset them and relearn them, other times if you just wait a few minutes they'll restore themselves. This does not fall into the ""reliable"" or ""dependable"" category. For what they cost, you can be assured that only the cheapest, least expensive commodity components are included, and so the quality appears to be rather sub-par. I like to save money, but I would gladly spend twice as much if I could get a unit that would work consistently and reliably. I guess the lesson here is, don't put the unit where it's difficult to get to (which is really the point of having a remotely controlled outlet...) because you will likely have to get to it to reset it. Again and again.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"

Great Quality & Easy Setup (no cumbersome WiFi switching during setup),5.0 ,"I was a bit skeptical when I saw this product. It's a lot more affordable than it's competitors (such as TP-Link). The smart plug comes in a very simple box that is only a little bigger than the smart plug itself. Setup is EXTREMELY easy. I'm the tech person in my household and this is by far the easiest smart device I've set up. The instructions provide a QR code that will open up a link on your mobile device to the app that controls this device (TuyaSmart). Once the app is installed all you need to do is plug in the smart plug into an outlet, hold the power button for 5 seconds to put it in setup mode, and then the app with automatically connect to it when you click next. What I really like about this product is that I don't have to connect to the device's own WiFi network in order to set it up like other smart devices; the app takes care of the connection for you without the cumbersome WiFi switching. I bought 4 of these and setup one of them with a hallway lamp to control using Amazon Echo's Alexa. I haven't set up the other 3, but I'm guessing it will be a piece of cake. The build quality is very nice. For the price I expected something that feels cheap, but it actually feels comparable it's competitors products.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
Save your time and money and look for something else,1.0 ,"This device requires user to create an account and register the device through their mobile app. Even though I really hate the fact that even this kind of simple simple device requires you to create an account (and collect your information) I decided to go for it. Otherwise I was not able to use this at all (=control via echo for example). During the account creation you have to give your phone number or email so they can send you the verification code. Once you input the code to the app you can continue with the registration process. In my case the verification code was never sent to either my email or my phone, even after multiple repeated attempts. Without the verification code I was not able to register and hence device is useless. Sent it right back to amazon, ordered another similar product instead. You'd think manufacturer makes the registration process idiot proof. Guess not.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
Loving these smart plugs!,5.0 ,"I was skeptical at first when it came to these MartinJerry mini Smart Plugs but now a fan! I think the hesitation in buying them initially was due to the lower price point versus some of the other brands on Amazon. I guess just because something costs more doesn't necessarily mean that it's more superior! Again, I became a fan of the smart plug when I saw a different brand on sale during a Lightning Deal feature. It was then when I realized I wanted more plugs but didn't want to shell out a lot of money. When I had ordered two of these Smart Plugs, I soon realized these plugs looked almost identical to the single one I purchased initially from a different brand and seller. Basically, I feel like they worked the same too! I have a total of three and each one is connected to a lamp in 3 different rooms in my home. Since I also downloaded the Tuya Smart app on my iPhone, now I can control the lights from literally anywhere in the world if I need to. What's even more amazing for me, even when I'm home and not utilizing the app per se, I've synced these smart plugs with my Amazon Echo Dot by enabling the Amazon Alexa Tuya ""skill"" and now I'm even lazier by laying in my bed and simply saying something to the effect of ""Alexa, turn off master bedroom light."" Technology is amazingly sinful. Again, for $13.99, these are a great deal in my mind. Also, if you're skeptical yourself, I would suggest doing some research and looking up some Tuya smart plug review videos on Youtube to get yourself comfortable with smart plugs and how they work.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"

Our second purchase of this compact smart plug,5.0 ,"Having been so impressed with the form and function of the first of these plugs we ordered, I sent for a couple more and I find set up on this second one even easier than it was the first time around...maybe due to my experience with the routine. If you're looking for a compact smart plug at a very reasonable price, you couldn't do better than this one. 7/28/17: The second or third of these small smart plugs we ordered had been clicking on and off periodically after being on for and hour or more. Once this on and off behavior starts it tends to repeat every so often. I've contacted the seller, and will most likely get a replacement, as this is the only one of the three we now own that seems defective. The problems seems to be the device momentarily losing contact with our wifi connection, and coming right back online. I think we would have to downgrade our original rating to 3 1/2 stars until this is rectified. Update - 8/10/17: The app and the plugs could maybe use a bit more work, but this company is completely 5-Star, all the way.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
"Used for weeks, and it works great",5.0 ,"I've had this for weeks, the plug is so small but amazing! It works perfectly with Alexa and App, no problems have cropped up yet. I purchased it for its Remote Control and now I realize its powerful function. I am afraid of the darkness, this is my trouble. I previously had to walk a long way to my bedroom after turning off the living room light, now I am able to turn off the light via Alexa voice command after going to bed. I have to say the little thing brings great convenience to me. Besides, its timer function is awesome. I could tap my phone to turn lights on/off at certain times, for example, I set the lighting-up time is 6：00pm，then the light will turn on at that time automatically, which makes me relax when I am not at home. Besides, the function makes it possible for me to make juice without getting off bed in the morning. All in all, I'll buy more in the future so as to control more devices, I think this plug is one of the best thing for smart home and is worthy to be installed in your home.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
Gets too hot at high power.,4.0 ,"Bought two of these, just because. I have a central vacuum system with a bad switch and had to manually turn it on in the garage. Now I just ask Alexa to do it. That part is great. I did have a couple issues, though. First, while vacuuming, it decided to turn itself off and on a couple times and then off. I restarted it from my phone and it worked until I was done. I assume if this keeps happening, I'll contact the manufacturer. I'll stay tuned on that. I wasn't sure what to do with the second one so I put it on my espresso machine. I need to start my machine and let it heat up for about an hour before my daily cappuccino. It would be very convenient to be able to schedule it or to start it remotely. The espresso machine draws 1000W and the plug is rated for 1100W so it should be fine. Well, after about 15 minutes I noticed that the plug was getting very hot. I pulled it out and burned my fingers slightly on the metal. That's too hot for me and I don't want to risk a fire, so I removed it from the smart plug and am currently using it on a lamp. My espresso is back to manual and it's plug gets only slightly warm during use. Seems like this isn't really good to use on higher power-draw appliances but it seems to do fine with the others. I'll keep it, but I still have to manually start my machine.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"

it is much better than other voice assistants,5.0 ,"I had my first Alexa product ( Echo) in late 2016, it is much better than other voice assistants, such as Siri. I bought several appliances to work with Alexa like bulbs, plugs, switches. This plug works as it should be and it is more beautiful than some previous designs. I have used it for around a week, and no problems at this stage.I will buy more under this brand.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
Very affordable Alexa controlled plug!,5.0 ,Had a few issues when I first tried setting these up... Customer service was super helpful and very responsive... Turned out they had some campatability issues with the Galaxy S8 phones... After we did some troubleshooting and determined that that was the issue... They released an update to their app and everything works great now! Go to tuya. Com from a pc and create an account before installing the app. I couldn't get the registration through the app via verification code to work. Once registered from the website...

Before I received the smart plugs I received an email from customer service with various pdf files on how to connect, etc. This is a nice touch! I unboxed and tried to install the device to my wifi.. It was not difficult but I must say it took a few tries for it to recognize my router. It connected to my Amazon Echo Dot flawlessly and it has been on line ever since. It works with either Alexa or the phone app just fine.

Each room can be controlled with automatic timing and special dexterity. This product is really safe and convenient and much more delicate than the other room. It is very beautiful and convenient to connect. It made my life more convenient.

Save Yourself the Headache,1.0 ,"I have about a dozen devices controlled by smart wifi plugs and wall switches. Belkin and TPlink occasionally drop connection, but they always return within moments unless they are well out of range. In such a case, it is more the fault of the installer because he's superseded the technical limits of the device. In the case of MartinJerry plugs, I've had them lose connection within 20 inches of the router serving them, and the connection cannot be reset without unplugging the device. This was not the case with only one of the five I ordered; ALL of them behaved identically. I even went so far as to alter wireless channel settings and assign IP addresses for each, but still the problems persisted. Daily, I would lose connection on every device at least 2 or 3 times. Finally, in frustration, I am returning all five that I purchased. I recommend spending a bit more on the tried and trusted TPlink or Belkin brand. A smart home should not be home to idiot devices like MartinJerry mini Smart Plugs!","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
Doesn't work with AT&T.,2.0 ,"Through a convoluted setup procedure which requires verification via text message code, you will find that this product can't sync with alexa if you have ATT as the carrier for your primary phone on the amazon account. The switch still works through their proprietary app, but won't interact with alexa. Verizon seems to work just fine.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
Customer service resolved my defective unit,4.0 ,"I’m rewriting this review from 1 star to 4 star. I originally received this item a few months ago, and it didn’t work. Basically it would click and switch to “on,” but no power was coming out of the plug. I was pretty ticked off and left a bad review and meant to return it, but I had put it off because I had a lot of things going on. So I reached out to them a couple weeks ago since it wasn’t still in its return period, and they apologized for not reaching out to me from the beginning and sent me a replacement product. The replacement product seems to be a newer model, and it uses a different app than the defective one went through. To clarify, they both connect with Alexa, but they also have their own smart home related app. Replacement has worked pretty well so far, I just use it for Christmas lights in my room. There was only one night when I tried telling Alexa to turn the lights off, but nothing happened. Fortunately I was able to turn the plug off by just pressing the power button on the side, and I haven’t had that issue since.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"

Broke first time I plugged something in.,1.0 ,"If you've a small bit of common sense it's easy to download the app and set up. Problem is the minute I plugged something in it broke.

Works but light flashes like strobe,2.0 ,"So it paired with Alexa and is a cheap alternative to the actual expensive plugs. The connection process is alittle confusing and took me about 20 minutes to actually nail down. The problem that gives it two stars is that I have it hooked up to a lamp, the lamp flashes on and off now randomly every few minutes.... the power switch keeps cycling without Alexa or my interference.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
Not great but works fine if you're careful,2.0 ,"It did the job I intended it for. However, be careful. The second one I bought - I plugged in a lamp while the smart plug was live and the lamp was turned on. There was a click and it stopped working. No blue light at all - no responses at all to the button on the device or the app. The app says it is offline. I tried other things, multiple outlets, press and hold, etc. It is dead. The minimal instructions were written by someone with only a passing acquaintance with English. It assumes prior knowledge of smart devices and wifi and so is not written for begiinners. It was then printed in a font requiring a magnifying glass. So if you have trouble installing and getting it to work - good luck. I don't own an Amazon smart speaker so I cannot comment on that functionality but the switch works fine with the android app while I am in the house (haven't tried it remotely yet). Although the link retrieved by the QR code in the instructions did not include a trigger to install so it deposited an APK somewhere on the phone, I went to the Play Store and installed the one there instead. I bought the smart plug to cycle my router periodically by turning the switch off on a schedule and back on 2 minutes later. It works great for that. You get what you pay for.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"

Small and works with Alexa,5.0 ,"I rencently bought an Echo on Prime Day and I am discovering the capability of using Alexa to control lights and other devices with smart plugs. I already have a few smart plugs in my house but they are big and each occupy a whole two-outlet plug. This one, with less than half the size, does a same work. The manual in the box provides straightforward instruction about how to set up and connect to Alexa. Also, it will not block the plug nest to it so it's much better in 'usability"".

So far so good.,5.0 ,"This was my first experience with ""smart plugs"" so I really have nothing to compare it with. I had ordered another cheapo chinese plug before this from another site but I have yet to receive it. -.- The form factor from the images are the same so I am expecting it to be a rebranded plug from the same manufacture but that is yet to be determined. Now back to the review. Long story short, it works great. I like the shape and size because it does not block the other outlet unlike many others that I've looked at. As mentioned, you are required to download their app for the initial setup to add the plugs to the cloud (yes cloud based and not direct wifi) and can be removed afterward (as far as I am aware). Then with your Alexa app, you add and log into the other account to sync. I have only been using it for about 2 or so week but so far so good; will update if need be.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
No thank you,1.0 ,"For one single device I have to download your app. It doesn't automatically connect to the Alexander app on my Fire tablet. I must download your app. Wait a minute! Your app isn't available on Amazon. It's only on Google play which of course means your app must go on my phone instead of my Fire Tablet. Then I must agree to your user license which entails sharing every call, text, GPS locations, WiFi connection history and basically anything and everything you could think of to record. Doesn't this seem like a real lot of big brother just to turn on a lamp? No thank you.

"Alexa no, Smart Life yes!!",3.0 ,"Worked with the Smart Life app, but not with Alexa. I followed the instructions exactly as described with 2 plugs and Alexa was unable to find them (yes, I enabled the skill within Alexa). However, I was successful in finding them with the Smart Life app on my cell phone. But, I purchesed to use with Alexa, so I returned them.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
and my friend recommended the WIFI outlet to me,5.0 ,"When I have a dinner in my friend's house, I found my friend was using this WIFI socket, which I found was very convenient, and my friend recommended the WIFI outlet to me. As I haven’t used this kind of products before, it does take me more than 20 min to set up it. It works as it should be for few days now, and I used it to control the bedroom light. I feel wonderful when I say “Alexa, please turn off the bedroom night.” and Echo reply me “OK”. When I got the product, I was very surprised. The logistics is really fast, the packaging is very strict, the WIFI socket has not been damaged a bit. Good service of Amazon prime! I am very grateful to my friend for recommending this product to me.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"

Would be nice if I could get it to work.,1.0 ,"I I was going to return this but I waited too long. I can't get it to work. I received the plug and downloaded the app but could not register, I put in my information but the NEXT button was greyed out, and I cannot find a solution. Other reviews said that there was great customer service, but I can't find any contact information. So it just sits.

This is a really a mini smart socket when compare with other ones,5.0 ,"My sister purchased an Amazon Echo in early May. And Amazon sent an email with a list of products that would works with my Echo. This is a really a mini smart socket when compare with other ones, and I was attracted by its appearance. The setting process is quite straight forward and I complete it within 20 min. The only flaw is that the font of the instruction is small. I will give 5 star to this newly launched smart plug as it works quite well with the Echo in my room for a few days.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"

A little bulky...,4.0 ,"Just got this and installed it. The installation process was pretty simple. I don't have an Amazon echo, so I just used the Tuya Home app. It works pretty well so far. Only drawback is that the socket is plug is pretty bulky.

Works with Alexa,5.0 ,"Works perfectly well with Alexa. Small size, which helps that it does not occupy both wall outlets. Setting up is a breeze. Would definitely get more of these. The smart plug is well built and of great quality. The size of the plug is also nice as it occupies only one outlet, letting you use the other outlet as well. Setting up the plug using the Smart Life app is a breeze, and so is linking it to Alexa. Works wonderfully well. Very happy with the purchase and would definitely buy more of these.","MartinJerry mini Smart Plug works with Alexa, Smart Home Devices that work with Alexa and Google Home, No Hub required, Easy installation and App control as Smart Switch On / Off / Timing (V01)"
