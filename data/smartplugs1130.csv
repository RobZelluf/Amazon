Five Stars,5.0 ,"I've been installing these in my house as well as a few buddies for home automation. A few notes on these... If your looking to automate your home, this is the best device I've seen for z-wave. I personally have been using Smartthings as a note to those who are looking to do HA. As others have noted, LED is on by default but is easily changed. I changed my to on only when the light is on the bedroom because I didn't want the light to shine in the room during the night. However, in the kitchen, I have the LED on when the light is on and vs. By far, these switches are going to run you about $10 more than the competition. But your going to save some time and effort with this switch. The box comes with the neutral wire which most do not and its a pain to make your own all the time given. Unlike the others out there, your house wires plug into the switch. This is an advantage for sure since you don't need wire nuts. Likewise, if your short on room in a box, this is perfect. The others out there have wires coming off the backs of the switch and add more of a mess inside the electric boxes. if you like this review, please indicate so by clicking the box below.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Good but check your wiring,5.0 ,"You need to check your wiring before ordering these. These switches require 3 wires: load, line, and neutral. Some of my light switch boxes do not have a neutral and our electrician could not get the switch to work. Called the company to confirm. Apparently Lowes has some z-wave switches which do not require the neutral wire. I'm giving a 5 star since it is not the fault of the switch - just do not want someone else to run into my difficulties.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
I now have a number of these working well,5.0 ,"ADD-ON COMMENTS MAY 26, 2016 - It's been over a year now since I installed this and I must say the set up has worked flawlessly. My garden lights come on and because it's based on sunset times, I never have to adjust for seasonal changes or daylight savings time changes, the way I would have to with those pesky clock timers that come with the garden light transformers. I had one instance where a rain storm tripped the GFIC and I texted my house keeper to hit the re-set on the GFIC and all was good. I have also one of these receptacles control a robotic web cam. That has worked really well also, as I use it to re-boot the webcam from Canada if I needed to. I've done this 2x in the past year. Sometimes I need to check or confirm something late at night and I can turn on the garden lights and have a look around with the webcam. The LED set up is dope! I get the equivalent of 300 watts of lighting using only 1/10 the power. I will deploy more of these at another house for a similar set-up. Truly allows great control and flexibility in a vacation home. MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: Perfect, installation was a breeze, paired no problem on my Schlage Nexia z-wave network. I put a GFCI before it, put it in a nice bubble cover (Hubbell MM2420C) now I can script and remotely control my garden lights (Malibu 8301-9601-01 50 Watt Cast Metal Flood Lights, Black Matte) in coastal Fl. I am doing this from Canada. The lights come on 15 minutes before sunset and shut off at 11PM. The lights are running Sunthin MR-16 5 watt LED's, driven by a 60 watt Ledwholesalers LED Power Suppply Driver Transformer 120 to 12 Volt DC Output, Water Resistance, 60 Watt, 3204-12V. Most of the previously mentioned items have been purchased through Amazon as one order. :-) I love it when everything comes together.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Easy to install,5.0 ,I was amazed at how easy this was to install. The instructions are clear and the terminals are well labeled. It even came with the neutral wire. I installed one in the garage to control my coach lights via Wink and Alexa. It is so nice having the lights on a programmed schedule now. Using the dimmer I can dial down the brightness with either the switch or my mobile app.,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works GREAT... when the household wiring allows installation,4.0 ,"I am told by my installer that there are 7 accepted ways to wire switches to lights, but only 1 of which is compatible with Z-Wave. So for now we're limited to where we can install these switches which of course is not where I prefer to have them installed.... we are still researching, if anyone has any advice, please leave a comment so I can have the switches installed and update this review. My recent immersion into Z-Wave was the Trane TZEMT400BB3NX N N SL Home Energy Management Thermostat with Nexia Home Intelligence, White (Z-Wave) and the Schlage FE599GRNX CAM 619 ACC 619 Keypad Lever Home Security Kit with Nexia Home Intelligence, Satin Nickel (Z-Wave) . However I learned from a customer service rep at Nexia that only powered components (thermostat, light switches, outlets, etc) will act as repeaters and battery operated components (entry door lock, dead bolt, motion sensor) will not act as a repeater, hence the cause of my dropped connections to my thermostat and he highly recommended I add more powered components to my network (Thanks Justin!) hence I ordered a small pile of these switches that I now unfortunately cannot use due to the wiring in my home. In the single location we were able to install one of these switches, it's working GREAT!! Using my Nexia account, the driveway lights now turn out automatically 30 minutes prior to dusk and turn off at a preset time. Then during the preset off time until a preset time in the morning, the switch is part of a scene activated when there is motion detected on the driveway and then sends us an alert email and text message. After a ""no motion"" message is passed back to the system this switch is then sent a message to again turn off, but only during those very late night hours. I have yet to see an off the shelf light that could be programmed to do this elaborate programming, very nifty! The quality of this switch is superb, the functionality is superb, but I'm docking a star due to the lack of feasibility in many wiring configurations.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Probably the best option for Z-Wave smart switch,4.0 ,"Great product. I replaced over a dozen switches in my home to enable voice command using the wink hub and Amazon Echo. I chose the GE Smart Switch since it supports 3-way configuration (where you have more than one switch that controls the same light fixture) and uses Z-Wave technology (as opposed to a vendor-specific offering like Lutron Caseta). I love the blue indicator light (easy to see in the dark) that illuminates whenever the light is 'off'. Attaching and removing electrical wires to and from the switch is simple- just tighten the corresponding screw. No soldering the ground wire or fumbling a push-in style switch to release the wire (not sure if that makes the connection less secure though). Be aware, the switch is larger than a standard toggle switch though so it takes up more space in the box and leaves less rooms for all the wires; you may have to spend some time arranging the wires before screwing in the switch or cram really hard. I did that once and the neutral wire detached from the screw nut. I also had to repeatedly remove all the side bars (the three prongs that stick out on the sides) to get them to fit next to each other, but presumably they're useful in certain installations and was only annoying because I had more than a dozen to install. The dimmer function itself is also a little sub-optimal if you're accustomed to a slider to control the brightness. For the smart switch, it's variable depending on how long you toggle the switch (how long you hold the on or off position) and that can result in what feels like a slight delay between the time you press the button to when the light dims or brightens.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
I am not sure why others have bashed this as ...,5.0 ,"I am not sure why others have bashed this as not being well made. It is typical construction, with a very heavy aluminum front plate. The screws for clamping the wires were typical construction and allowed normal tightening without stripping . FYI: Be sure you read the instructions and take note about the pairing distance of 10' or less. The short pairing distance is the design of the Z-Wave interface, not a problem with this device. If you are pairing this to a fixed alarm panel or similar device, you may need to power it up with an extension cord and place it near the Z-Wave host for pairing. Once you have ""registered"" it with the host, you can power it down then install it in the switch box.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
These are an excellent way to save from having to purchase a bunch ...,4.0 ,"These are an excellent way to save from having to purchase a bunch of smart LED lights and instead just change the outlet. For example, say you have a living room with six can lights. If you bought six HUE bulbs so you can remotely control the lights with your phone you would need to spend $60/bulb x 6. With this outlet you need just one outlet. Note the outlet I am reviewing is only an ""on-off"" and does not have a dimmer function (see Dimmer Smart Switch which is $10 more than the standard). The reason I only gave it 4-5 stars is due to its huge size and amount of real estate it takes up in the switch box. It'll be just fine if you are installing it in a stand-alone box but if you are trying to install it a shared box you will not only have trouble but run out of room quickly. The box says you can ""bend"" the side metal plates (and then provides amp instructions for maximum amount of amps) but my electrician tells me that's a bad idea as they need room on the side. I know there are a lot of reviews complaining about the different ""look"" of the switch sticking out horizontal rather than at an angle but the reason for this is the switch is always ""active"" for use by a person in location touching the switch or remotely (e.g., by a phone). The smart bulbs, for example, always have to be on and if I have one installed on a floor lamp and the lamp is switched 'off' I cannot control the light remotely from my phone (for example). However with this outlet even if they have manually been turned off you can still control them remotely (from my phone or iPad, for example) since the switch is always ""on""--hence the reason it's always in the ""middle"" position. Overall, very happy with the product and plan to order many, many more (given space in my box)...","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
This was very easy to install and then add to my Smartthings network,5.0 ,"This was very easy to install and then add to my Smartthings network. Had it up and running in very short order. I like that using this outlet allows me to set Smartthings to automatically turn on my living room light at sunset and then turn it off at 11pm. I used to use a plug in timer and it was a pain to keep adjusting the on time as the time it gets dark varies day to day. It's also nice if i want it on to say ""Echo, turn on the living room light"".","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Z-Wave Beaming Relay helps Tie Multiple Distant Z-Wave Items Together,4.0 ,"I bought this because of it's beaming features. I didn't really need a light but I had several Z-Wave deadbolts in my house that were located to far away from one another to complete the Z-Wave mesh network. Since they're battery powered locks, they need a device with ""beaming"" features to serve as a relay-hub and this fit the bill nicely. As others mentioned it's a little tricky to install just because it needs three wires where many switches will only have two. A third neutral connection is required since the switch itself needs to be powered in addition to switching the load off and on to whatever you're actively switching. Pairing it with my Vera controller was something of a pain and I had to consult a few web forums. It seems the initial connection can be hard to make, but once it's made it ""sticks"" just fine. It took me probably 10-12 attempts just repeating the pairing process over and over again until my Vera unit flashed its LEDs at me indicating a proper handshake. After the initial setup, however, the switch has performed exactly as expected. I have it turning an exterior porch light off and on per scene definitions in Vera. My initial reason for buying it, to serve as a hub/relay for my Z-Wave deadbolts, worked great too. Where I had several too far away to consistently report into Vera, with this in the mix I get solid connections to them all.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
My first choice for smart light controls,5.0 ,"Let me start by saying that I have a large number of smart devices in my home all integrated through Wink. I have lighting controlled by a variety of means, including bulbs and smart outlets on power strips. This Smart Light Switch by GE is by far the most reliable way to have smart light controls. For a quick comparison of the methods I have used: Smart Bulbs: Very convenient and work in any light fixture that the bulb fits into. Convenience is the biggest factor, and they are relatively inexpensive if there are few bulbs in the fixture. However, if you have fixtures with more than 3 bulbs, smart switches become a more affordable option. The downside to these, in my experience, seems to be that they are more annoying to set up, less reliable, and resetting can be very difficult if they aren't working properly (if you don't get the on/off pattern timing perfect, they won't reset). Of the many smart bulbs I put in (a combo of Cree Connected and GE Link), I had multiple that required multiple resets and were not always responsive. In addition, the bulbs always need power to work with smart controls, so if someone hits the light switch to turn them off, you can't turn them back on with smart controls like Wink, SmartThings, or Amazon Echo. One last downside is that each bulb is triggered with its own command from the smart home management system, so they come on in a wave. One upside to these is adding smart control to a ceiling fan running off of only one wall switch. With the ceiling fan, you can put in smart bulbs and use those to control the lights without turning off the whole fan if you don't want to use the cord. Smart Switch: Definitely my favorite method. These are extremely reliable in comparison to other methods. Only took me 1 try to get each of them connected to the hub and they have always responded since I set them up a few weeks ago. I have never had to reset any of them. In addition, you can turn the lights off at the switch and still have them work with your smart home configurations if you want to turn them back on. The downside is the price, as smart bulbs are often found for $10-$15 each, so if you don't need more than 3, the switch is definitely more expensive. In addition, installation is a bit more complicated as you have to wire the switch into the wall, whereas bulbs can just be plugged in as usual. Smart Power Strips: I have the Pivot Power Genius. It is a bit slow and somewhat unreliable. It frequently turns off on its own. It is very inexpensive now, but just a reliable lighting control. I don't recommend this method. I can't compare to other smart outlets, though. In short, this switch is great. It is reliable, relatively easy to install, and not very expensive. If you want smart controls in a fixture with more than 3 bulbs, this is the way to go. If you want smart controls for fixtures with less than 3 bulbs and don't mind the extra cost, this is the way to go. Eventually, I plan on replacing as many smart bulbs as possible with these smart switches because they are much more convenient to use and much more reliable. I would highly recommend this smart switch because it works so well and is less expensive than competitor switches (like Leviton).

Just works,5.0 ,"Installed several of these and everything went smoothly. They are wider than a standard toggle switch, but still fit in all the panels. I even have one triple switch panel and they fit side by side. After installing them, I flipped on the switch, then went to the Z-wave controller and it automatically detected and added the device. No having to mess with tamper switches like other Z-wave devices (which this doesn't have anyways). I know some people were wondering about whether the neutral connection is required. I do have the neutral wires, and it was necessary to connect the neutral before the switch worked. So I cannot comment on if the neutral connection is required if you don't have the neutral wires.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works with metal switch plate and plastic electrical box in my installation!,5.0 ,"I was hesitant to install this in a 4 gang plastic switch box with a decorative metal switch plate. I was worried that the metal plate would interfere with the signal. However It works perfectly, probably because of the plastic box. The switch is about 20 feet from the Smart Things Hub on the next floor. The response time is about 2 seconds using my smartphone out of range of my local WiFi network, (using 4g phone network) and instantaneous when the phone is connected to my local WiFi. Now that I know this works so well I will be adding several more ""Things"" to my system! It would be a minor but nice improvement when adding devices, if the Smart Things App would pop up a message telling you to tap the device switch to sync, instead of just showing it is searching for devices as the rotating symbol spins around. This is covered in the written instructions but it is easily overlooked.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Installed easy and works well.,5.0 ,"Was a bit apprehensive about this as my first attempt to install a z-wave light control. The instructions were easy to follow but I've basic understanding of electrical wiring and did some basic work at home previously. The unit itself it much larger than a standard light switch. Make sure you have enough space to install this. I had to move some wires around to make this fit but mainly due to the wiring work of the electrician who wired the house. Once installed, setting it up was not difficult. My controller was able to recognize it quickly and everything was up and running in minutes. So nice to be able turn my lights on/off when I'm not physically near the switch.

All I have to do now is say ""Alexa, Kitchen light on"" and bam...it's on! When I'm done, ""Alexa, Kitchen light off"" and go about my mary little way. May seem lazy right? Not when the builders of your home put the light switch to the kitchen down the hall and about the equivalent of two bedrooms away from the edge of the kitchen (who does that?|!) Now I dont have to run down the hall like zombies are chasing me to turn the kitchen light on when I'm down for a midnight snack. Love it and plan to do my whole house a few at a time!

"Good, would be great with the inclusion of LED indicator. Great way to automate home lights!!",4.0 ,"The reason I'm giving this 4/5 stars is that pricing should be cheaper being that there isn't much ""tech"" going into the add-on switch. Not only that, but I wish GE incorporated the LED light onto the Add-On switches as well so you can easily locate the switch in a dark room. But let's talk about why it did earn the 4 stars. First of all, they were fairly simple to install, paired easily with my Samsung SmartThings hub (gen 2) and have been working reliably since. I can also easily control the lights through Amazon's Alexa enabled devices, but that's because of interoperability between Alexa and Samsung. Please be sure to check and make sure you have a neutral wire available before ordering this switch or it's counterpart!! Also, I'm not an electrician by any means, but am a self-taught handyman and I believe almost anyone can install this light with the help of Google!","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
it worked like a charm,4.0 ,"I bought this as my first Z-wave light switch to test it out. I have a HomeSeer setup with a Aeotec Z-Stick for the software and controller hardware. First the installation process. In summary, the switch feels very solid and well made. Instructions are very simple and do not explain everything you need to know. I will buy more now that I know what to do. This took me more than a little while to do because the instructions were not very clear. The diagram indicates you only have to connect the hot and line (wire to lights). It shows the ground and neutral as optional. I connected the ground but not the neutral. After trying everything I could think of, I finally gave up and called tech support. The tech informed me that I had to connect the neutral switch for it to work. He explained that I needed to take the little white wire included with the box and connect it to the bundle of white wires in the box. Not explained in the instructions. After that, it worked like a charm. The instructions also don't explain how to initiate pairing. The tech told me to turn the power on and then back off to initiate pairing.

"Often the gang box isn't deep enough to hold all the wires easily and requires some ""force"" to get everything in place",4.0 ,"Very difficult to fit into multigang boxes. Often the gang box isn't deep enough to hold all the wires easily and requires some ""force"" to get everything in place. If there was a way to make these smaller so they fit into normal gang boxes easier, that would be a major improvement with this device. Functionally they work perfectly. I was able to get SmartThings to control this device very easily upon applying power and even get Amazon Alexa to control it as well.

Pool Light Application/Conversion and Alexa Integration,4.0 ,"Ihave had this installed for about two weeks now. Took a while to convert everything from incandescent to LED and then to this switch. Didn't realize at first I needed neutral wire. Had to run a neutral line to box. I used this outside for my pool light on my swimming pool. Remains to be seen if this can hold up in the Phoenix, AZ summers and not fail. I think it said rated to 104 degrees F. Definitely gets a lot hotter in the summer. Plus, this switch is enclosed in a metal junction box. I never thought the Z wave function would transmit in this metal enclosure, but it does. I also interfaced it with Alexa and Samsung Smarthings. All works well except the dimming function is not accurate. Percentage of dimming on the APP does not correlate well. Perhaps related to the type of LED bulb I have in my pool. Now when I want pool light on I just say, ""Alexa, pool light on or off"" Pretty cool. I have a spa light and also waterfall that are now potential for home automation. This home automation stuff can go on and on. Definitely cool. Converting over incandescent bulbs to LED and then to automation definitely requires some electrical and mechanical skills on your part.

Just want I wanted!,5.0 ,"They seem to be well manufactured and solid, but do they work? YES! This product is exactly as described. Pay attention to the directions - the directions are very clear. I first purchased two GE 12723 Add-On Switches with one GE Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Dimmer Switch in order to test them out before buying them for the entire house. I ran several tests. First, I connected the Controller Dimmer by itself with one incandescent light AND one LED light in a a two-way configuration - Everything worked fine. Then I added one Add-On Switch - so now we have a three-way configuration - Everything worked fine. Then I added the second Add-On Switch - now we have a Four-way configuration - Everything worked fine. In other reading and reviews, I heard that some dimmers have problems with low load on the line - the dimmers would not turn on at all. So, I removed the incandescent light leaving only one 5 watt LED light. Now, you can't get much lower load than that. Happily, the switches worked flawlessly. That's it for the actual review, but here is a little background. In my last home, ten years ago, there were few options for automation. At that time I did a lot of research and decided on Lutron Radio RA (a proprietary system). I have to say, ""That system was solid - expensive, but solid - it never failed"". Needless to say I was very happy with it for over 5 years, until I wanted to add to it. Then I discovered that Lutron discontinued Radio RA and replaced it with Radio RA II which was not downward compatible. So my only options were to replace everything in my house or buy used, if I could find it. I felt that Lutron betrayed there original customers by not supporting the first version. So, on my new home, I have decided to use an open architecture type system and I have decided on zWave. Now I can buy all of the component parts from many companies (hubs, switches, sensors, everything) and I am no longer dependent on a single proprietary company. With Open Architecture, you have more options, more development, more competition, which all leads to more innovation and lower prices. Today, there are aspects of zWave products that need improvement, but it's getting better every day and more and more companies are getting on board. If one company abandons zWave, there are many more out there to choose from.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

My requirements were pretty simple - I wanted it to fit in the same space as the existing switch and work with my SmartThings hub, and my Amazon Echos. This switch fit the bill. Installation was easy. The switch I replaced didn't use a neutral wire which is required for this switch but the neutral was in the box so I just hooked it up with the included white wire and I was in business.

Love installing without a neutral.,5.0 ,"Love love love being able to have a new switch available that doesn't require a neutral. Even though I have a brand new house, there happened to be two switches that didn't have a neutral - so now I'm able to get the rest of my lights and switches automated. Also - before I switched out to my incandescence bulbs, the CFLs flickered like crazy. It's mentioned in the description of the product no CFLs and no LED lights on this switch.

Very nice feature. We never have to worry about touching ...,5.0 ,"I use this with the ADT Pulse system to control a light with a camera. We have an outdoor camera that over looks a certain door at our house. Normally we leave the light off, because no one is ever out there. However, I was able to program this successfully to turn on (only at night) when that camera detects motion. It works very quickly, in fact I approached it from several different angles, and each time the light turned on in enough time to get full HD color shot of the person around the door/windows the camera over looks. Once the camera goes 15 mins without detecting motion it turns the light back off. Very nice feature. We never have to worry about touching the light switch either, as I was working on the house, and motion feature tied in to ADT kept the lights on until I left. We also never worry about leaving the light on. Installation was easy but some notes: 1: You must have 3 wires minimum to use this in the switch box. Line (Hot), Load (Black to light), Neutral. 2. If your switch is in line with the light, and the neutral goes from the light back to the breaker box, and not to the switch you cant use this. The Z-Wave needs to stay powered. If your neutral line from your light goes back to the switch you can use this. So if you only have a black wire in to the switch, and black wire away from the switch, but no neutral wire in the switch you will have to either add a neutral, or you cant use it. 3. Easy to install if you know what your doing. I had this installed, and up and running in less than 10 minutes from receiving the package, opening it, to having it up and working.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Primary & Add-on Work Great, But Maybe Not With Fluorescent",5.0 ,"I got the primary and the add-on switches to replace a 3-way fluorescent kitchen light. (A 3-way is used where two switches control one light.) All was wonderful for about an hour or so. Then the add-on switch would not turn on the light, and it would turn it off by pressing either the top or the bottom button rather than just the bottom. I turned off the power at the main panel to reset the switches, and all was well again - for about an hour or so. I called tech support. The first question she asked was what kind of light I had connected. She said it would work with CFL bulbs, but possibly not all fluorescent - or maybe I had a bad switch and should replace them. She suggested I try these switches on other lights first. Well, we have wanted to put LED bulbs in the kitchen anyway, so I opted to replace the fluorescent bulbs with LED bulbs and bypass the ballast. When I did this, the switches still did not work correctly. I didn't actually know at this point if the switches were bad originally, or if the ballast in the fluorescent fixture had damaged the switches. The tech support person did not know either. Amazon replaced the switches and now all is well. I love them - they work with Wink - and they work with the Amazon Echo. My original 3-way had three wires: black, white, & red. In the primary switch, I made the black the line, the white the load, and the red the traveler. Of course, you also connect the white wire included with the switch to the neutral. The add-on switch only allows two connections, the included white wire for the neutral and the traveler, which in my case was red. Since the add-on switch does not connect to 120v power, I used a wire nut (not included) to join the black and white together.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Primary & Add-on Work Great , But Maybe Not With Fluorescent",5.0 ,"I got the primary and the add-on switches to replace a 3-way fluorescent kitchen light. (A 3-way is used where two switches control one light.) All was wonderful for about an hour or so. Then the add-on switch would not turn on the light, and it would turn it off by pressing either the top or the bottom button rather than just the bottom. I turned off the power at the main panel to reset the switches, and all was well again - for about an hour or so. I called tech support. The first question she asked was what kind of light I had connected. She said it would work with CFL bulbs, but possibly not all fluorescent - or maybe I had a bad switch and should replace them. She suggested I try these switches on other lights first. Well, we have wanted to put LED bulbs in the kitchen anyway, so I opted to replace the fluorescent bulbs with LED bulbs and bypass the ballast. When I did this, the switches still did not work correctly. I didn't actually know at this point if the switches were bad originally, or if the ballast in the fluorescent fixture had damaged the switches. The tech support person did not know either. Amazon replaced the switches and now all is well. I love them - they work with Wink - and they work with the Amazon Echo. My original 3-way had three wires: black, white, & red.

"Easy install, but big box and bright blue light.",4.0 ,"Installation is simple, if you know how to turn off your circuit breaker and have a screwdriver, you can do it yourself. One downside to this unit is that behind the face is a large box containing the electronics. If you have an older home with small electrical boxes, or if your electrical box is crowded with other outlets and too much extra wiring, it can be a bit of a challenge to fit. Of course you can take this opp if you have an older home with small electrical boxes, or if your electrical box is crowded with other outlets and too much extra wiring, it can be a bit of a challenge to fit opportunity to do some organization of the wiring, trimming excess, etc. another downside to this unit is that there is a blue light on the front that is quite bright. Depending on your installation location and particular use, that light may create an unexpected point of focus for something that should be as unobtrusive as a power outlet.

Great for non-dimmable under-cabinet LED lights,5.0 ,"I use these with my Samsung SmartThings hub. They paired right up. In our kitchen, we have these under-cabinet LED strips that plug into an outlet, so I used these outlets to control the LED lights. I didn't need dimming control because the LED strips aren't dimmable anyway. One of the two outlets is controlled by Z-Wave and the other one is always on. I hadn't realized before, but there's a button in between the outlets, which you can use to manually switch power to the Z-Wave outlet. This is always good when whatever smart lighting program I've set isn't working for some reason and my wife just wants the damn light to come on. (This hasn't actually happened to me yet, but I know I would get an earful were it to happen and there weren't a manual switch I've already told her about.) Since these nodes of your home automation network are powered, they extend your mesh network. I had an outdoor Z-Wave switch in my garage that the network was not reaching until I installed these outlets in the kitchen, at which point everything connected up fine.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Best Z-Wave switch...,5.0 ,"I am new to home automation and recently started working on home automation, one thing at a time. I bought a used switch from Amazon warehouse and it works perfectly. I have it connected to my Samsung Smartthings. The Smartthings recognized the switch within a minute and is working flawlessly since. I use it to control a light and the existing switch was installed without a neutral connection. I was real confused as to where to find a neutral connection but after a little search I found all the neutral ( white ) wires are all spindles together and is kept in the back of the box. Installed the supplied white wire on the switch and added it to other white wires and all problems solved. I bought another one and installed it today. Both are working good and I am really liking home automation now. It's real easy to install but please shut off the breaker before trying any electrical system updates.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Love the zwave products,4.0 ,"Love the zwave products. Instruction is not that clear on how to install the switch. After spending 10 minutes searching the web for hints and tips, found useful information to install the switching and the color coding of the wire. After the switch installed, I spent the next three days (mostly in the evening after work) to try to get the switch registered with the smartthings hub. Not much instruction nor anything on the switch to tell me what is going on. Would be nice if there is somekind of light as inidicator that it is alive and sending signal or failing sending out signal. After trying random things based on some instructions found on the web, manage to get the switch registerd with the controller. I still don't know what I did that register it, just lucky I guess... There are a few more switches that I want to convert over to zWave, however due to the hard time configurating this one. causes me to pause on the next purchase.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Pairs and works flawlessly!,5.0 ,I love these switches. Ya they are a little expensive but they work great. Pairs very easily with my smartthings hub 2. I didn't think I would add so many things to my hub but I've got at least 30 things on it now with at least 12 routines and different smart apps and everything with these switches are working great. I've never need to rental them or anything. They are bigger than your normal switch but with a little squishing they have fit into all of my gang boxes. My house was made in 1969 if thats any reference to anyone. You do need a neutral wire connect for these switches to work. If there isn't already a neutral wire in your gang box there is one that come with the switch. I have these switches connected to 6 led's on one witch all the way to just one led light bulb on another switch and I haven't had any problems with buzzing or not working right!

So I called SamSung they looked at the account and advised that the HUB was fine and that the outlet was not communicating to the HUB...long story short...I returned the GE OUTLET...now back to a good old outlet...not as cool but reliable...I might be returning the HUB as well, just waiting to see if I'm going to spring for another wireless outlet...","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Bright Blue LED,5.0 ,"I have been using this outlet for a few months now. It is hooked into my Wink controller, so I can control it from my phone from across the city. I got this specifically to control a non-remote control pedestal fan. This outlet plus the fan equaled the cost of a fan that had remote control built in. So it was basically a free controlled outlet. There is a blue LED in the middle of the outlet. That LED is lit when the switched outlet is OFF. It is incredibly bright, and with the outlet in my bedroom, it is too bright. Thankfully, it turns off when the outlet is on, so it's almost always off. According to the instructions and what I found online, the LED can be set to work differently (always on, always off, or switched with the outlet). Sadly, that isn't an option on the Wink. That isn't an issue with the outlet though. Just in case it isn't clear, only one of the outlets is switched. the other one is always on.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Switch only have 2 poles (not including the ground), so wiring is a little different from standard 3 pole 3 ways switch. Once I traced the source, common, and traveler wires, connecting the switches took only minutes. The components of this switch is 2 times the size/dept of a regular switch.

"Good switch, but remember: requires a neutral, and hot/load terminal order matters.",5.0 ,"This is a good switch, and simple to install - with 2 caveats: 1) Load (black), line/hot (black) terminal positions matter, unlike on a standard single pole switch. 2) Requires a neutral connection. Create one by using a pigtail connection to the neutral wire bundle in the existing box. I had to run back and forth to my panel a few times until I figured this out. The wiring diagram does show this setup, but doesn't explicitly explain the hot/load order matters and that the switch requires a neutral to function. Once wired up, switch works great and is easy to pair.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
I was glad it came with the jumper because I didn't feel ...,5.0 ,"I bought this so I could remotely control my front porch light. I've installed and replaced light switches before and the instructions don't make it clear that the white wire is mandatory and that is what the extra piece of wire is for. I installed the line, load, and ground and turned power back on. Line was live but load was not and the light would not turn on. I found a video just in case I missed something and the video mentioned to install the white wire using the included jumper. I was glad it came with the jumper because I didn't feel like undoing the existing wires and figuring out which one I needed since I was installing in a three gang box. After that was connected I turned the power on again and got the switch connected to my SmartThings hub without dragging it from one room to another and without having to exclude it first.

Put Some Z in Your Wave.,5.0 ,"So far so good. I bought two to connect to my Wink hub in a media room. They wired up easily and have functioned for a few months. I guess my only thing is how bright the blue LED is on the outlet. Fortunately, the two outlets are hidden by a piece of furniture and it blocks it. Some people may like the brightness, some may not. I suppose it depends on the intended usage. I also wish they came in a duplex style plug, but these two things are tiny in relation to the positives. I had to add one more thing: When adding the outlet to my hub, it didn't link right as a GE plug. I believe I used Leviton for it to function correctly when setting everything up.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Great Z-Wave Wall Switch,5.0 ,"I've been building out my Smart Home Automation within the house and needed a Z-Wave light switch that would replace a malfunctioning timer switch (controlling my outdoor stoop and garage lights.) Install is a snap (but remember you MUST have a Neutral Wire for this work.) Took under 10 minutes to remove the old switch, install this new switch, have my Smartthings Hub discover it and then to add the simple Timer rules (on and sunset / off at sunrise.) Acts as a Z-Wave Repeater as well so my other devices are all connecting much better now. I can now start to add more complex rules controlling when and why lights go on and off thru Smartthings mobile app. Nice switch, good price, works great.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

The first 3 took me 1.5 hours to install, although it says int the manual that it should take about 15 min. But once I figured it out the next set of 2 was easy. I only needed to connect 3 wires - 1 hot, 1 common, and 1 neutral (white). I have my switches connected to Samsung Smartthings Hub. One thing that was annoying was that the switch had to be within 10 ft or so of the ST Hub, otherwise it'd wouldn't connect. But once it's connected, they work great. I have mine set up so that the little blue light stay on when the light is off. It makes it easier to find the light switch in the dark.

"Good product, needs fine tuning to become great",4.0 ,"I set up a 3 way. The good: it's a nice solution - the way it powers lights up and down reminds me of a Lutron. The bad: the thing is massive. The control switch requires every type of wire in the box, so once you pull them all out, good luck getting them back in. Getting the thing to fit in the box took as much time as wiring it. If you have older style boxes get ready for frustration - I have no idea how you would do a 4-gang - not a lot of room once you stuff (and I mean stuff) these giants in. The controller switch is too tall - the slide switch will lock up once you put a faceplate on because the thing needs to be about 1/16 of an inch shorter to move in a standard faceplate cutout - so make sure it is set to ""on"" because it will never move again. The instructions stink. I was all over Google and YouTube to make sure I wasn't going to mis-wire it. They ought to direct you to a video specific to the switch because it is not a typical wiring setup. Besides, explaining to the DIY installer in basic language what the heck the 4 wires do, how the circuit operates in the controller/slave setup is just a basic safety item in this case.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Hard to physically hard wire, works great after that",4.0 ,"Works great with my Vera Edge hub. Also looks and feels like a ""real"" light switch, even an expensive real light switch, not a cheap or complicated gadget. I had to push the button a few times to get it pair, but that wasn't a big deal, like maybe it took 20 seconds instead of 10 seconds then it paired just fine even with the hub across the house. They also come with a pigtail wire to help you attached to the neutral, which is nice since the neutral is not wired to a regular mechanical switch So if you have a neutral in a wire nut at the back of box you're all set. The problem with these is that these are the hardest switches to install I've ever encountered in terms of actually attaching the wires to the screw terminals. The screws tend to ""fall into"" the housing until they're tightened, and they're recessed into the housing in way that makes it hard to get the wire around them. Maybe there's some trick I don't know. If I add more I'm undecided whether to see if another brand is easier to install, or just stick with this brand for consistency and because in the end it does work.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
The switch easily paired with both a VeraLite controller as well as ...,5.0 ,"The switch easily paired with both a VeraLite controller as well as the Wink hub I just purchased. We are using several of these to control outdoor lights on our porch, garage doors, sidewalk. The run on a schedule to come on every night around dark and shut off at 10pm. With VeraLite they work flawlessly and you are even able to change the variable to turn the blue LED indicator On when the switch is On and Off when the switch is off. By default it is the other way around. Vera also always a dynamic start time in the schedule so you can turn on at sunset or sunset +/- several minutes. No need to adjust the on time based on the seasons it does it for you! Wink is still having issues correctly reporting the status of generic z wave devices such as this one. It keeps track of the on/off of each switch if I am using the Wink app to control them. However if you use the switch manually (heaven forbid) or use them in a Wink schedule, the app just doesn't keep up. The good thing about z wave is that On and Off are distinct values, so if you cycle through your lights in the Wink App flipping them On and Off you can rest assured the app is now is sync with the lights. Hopefully this is something Wink address sooner than later. Where Wink does have an advantage is their native support for Geo-Fencing. In addition to a set schedule I have always wanted VeraLite to turn the outside lights On for 15-20 min if my wife and I happen to arrive home late (after 10pm when the lights are off). This is something easily built into a Wink Robot which uses your iPhone location to let Wink know when you are arriving at or leaving from a set address.

The wiring diagram was initially unclear (especially the ground/common wiring), which when you blow the diagram up, all of a sudden become more clear. The switch works well, and was easily able to be configured and recognized by the Samsun Smarthings hub. It was easily configured to turn on my outside lights at sunset, and turn them off at sunrise. It works flawlessly and has never dropped the connection or failed to work. It works as a regular switch all the time, which does not impact the automated function. There is a small blue LED light on the lower right corner than is lit when the device is connected, but not on. It goes off when the switch is activated.

Great switches if you have a neutral wire,5.0 ,"I have five of the GE Z-Wave Plus products, and all of them function near perfectly.

Other than that, it is a simple deal to wire them in and connect them to your Z-Wave hub (I use Wink 2). GE is one of the few that actually offers an in-wall fan controller, and it actually works great, you get more than just Low-Medium-High, but the entire 1-100% range.

This switch was easy to wire, joined painlessly to my z-wave network, and looks very clean. I would highly recommend this switch for you smart home! To clear up a little confusion: This device needs a 'neutral' wire. There's a very good chance that you have that, if your has has been built fairly recently ~10 years(?). The 'neutral' wire is typically white, whereas the load and line will be black. My only complaint is the cost of this device, but that is a fact of life with z-wave currently.

These are GREAT!,5.0 ,"I searched the internet high and low to find z-wave light switches that will work on a 3 way switch (meaning two different switches can control the same light for example). This was the only brand I found that would work for me because my house is filled with 3 way switches. These are really nice because you can buy the $19 add on slave switch to go with this. Any way this totally solved my problem and need (or should I say ""want"") for having my entire house equipped with ""smart"" switches. Now when I go to bed I can just turn off all the lights at once from my iPhone, Vivint Alarm panel, my husbands Android phone, tablet, etc. Another nice perk is that these switches CAN be added to a Vivint Sky Panel (Security Alarm) because it runs off z-wave then you don't need to buy a hub. If connecting to your Vivint Sky Panel just call Vivint customer service and they'll give you a temporary code to get into what's called the ""tool panel"" and walk you there adding them. Something else you should know is that these are deep and will be a tight fit when installing them because the back is much deeper than a regular switch.

This switch once installed linked up immediately to my ADT Pulse alarm system. This switch is fairly large so in order to fit it into my junction box with 3 other switches I had to remove the side tabs, no big deal bend them back and forth a couple of times and they come right off, easiest to do this before you install the switch into the wall. At $41.00 this was a great deal if you are comfortable working with electricity, if not even if you need to hire an Electrician the money you save on buying this switch from this seller will offset the money you will pay the electrician.

Works with ADT Pulse (from 15 ft away on different floors).,5.0 ,"This is to advertise my stupidity, and to save everyone else the same trouble I went through. I struggled for 2 days to pair it with ADT Pulse. The mistake I was making was: I thought the Load and Line connections were interchangeable (in a typical switch, that is likely true) so didn't pay much attention to what Load vs Line meant. So, I connected the line to ""Load"" and vice versa. The switch never came on. I thought the switch wasn't close enough to the gateway -- that's why it wasn't pairing (Note that even without pairing, you must be able to get the LED on -- if not, then your wiring is off). USEFUL INFO: It works with ADT pulse (as many have already said). More importantly, you do NOT need to bring the switch very-close to the gateway (which can be very difficult to do for this device). In my case, the switch was on the first floor and the gateway in the basement (about 15 feet away, I guess, with a couple of walls in between). CHALLENGES: Apart from me confusing with the load and line, the main challenges are: (i) You need to have a neutral, (ii) The switch does take a lot of space -- so, fitting them inside the box can be a bit of challenge (I installed two together), (iii) breaking the tabs away requires some non-trivial effort.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

If you have limited electrical experience, you may want to consider getting professional help. This is at the outside edge for a causal DIY. Take your time and identify line/load/traveler with a multimeter on both of your existing switches before disconnecting them. Note that you will need to connect a neutral because the switch itself is a working item, not merely an interruptor. The switch itself is sturdy and connections were a breeze. It is a sizable item, so if you have a multi-gang box you may find space gets tight if you try to place more than one of these. One I had it hooked up correctly, it worked fine. It did take a couple of attempts to get it added to my network (Wink Hub).

This was more expensive than the paddle switch (which I have bought several). PROS Works with SmartThings Hub v2 Easy to setup and install. Worked with existing switch plate. GE brand is reliable. Good reviews. CONS Price, should be under $20 More expensive than paddle switch. Only came in one color. Toggle is a bit odd and stands out. RECOMMENDATIONS Add a ivory cap to toggle.

One bad switch out of four.,5.0 ,"Bought 3 of these to use with SmartThings Hub. The first two switches installed as expected and synched with the Hub instantly. The third switch refused to synch with the Hub but did work fine on manual. After a few hours of trying to get a synch, I realized the switch was probably bad. Tried calling Jayco but there was a two hour wait on the phone. I am not going to wait that long. Contacted Amazon on Monday after noon and there was a new switch on my porch by Tuesday afternoon. I have no idea how Amazon does this but they must be using teleportation or black magic. Anyway, the new switch installed easily and synched with the Hub instantly. Even though I got one bad switch, I still give these switches 5 stars and will buy more.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Defective over time with blinking blue light of death,2.0 ,"I bought around 40 of these altogether and Z-Waved my house all up: lights, dimmers, locks, sensors, you name it. The only problem is these GE modules keep flaking out and dying. They go into a mode where the blue light flashes and neither the Z-Wave controls nor the manual controls work. It'd be one thing if it just lost Z-Wave connectivity, but the fact that it doesn't degrade gracefully into a normal lightswitch is an absolute failing. The manual contains no information about what a blinking blue light means. I've been unable to hard reset them or get the working again, which means I need to start returning these as they fail. Other minor problems I could live with: *) the blue light sometimes fails as well (a few of my 40 never have a blue light, despite its Z-Wave config for when it's on) *) there's a quarter second of latency between touching them and the light actually turning on or off. Disappointed in GE. I wanted to love these.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
5 STARS for Dimming Switch and On/Off Switch but 2 STARS for Fan control,5.0 ,"Z-Wave pairing works fine and easy for all GE switches. Physical buttons on Dimming and On/Off switches are great, but more difficult to use on Fan control model. Fan control has only 3 speeds so you need to press long enough to get to the next speed but not too long or you will skip the medium speed. Not a major issue but compare to other GE switches Fan control is not as easy to use. The indicator light is customizable, can turn on when switch is on or programmed to turn on when switch is off, based on your needs. Dimming and On/Off switches work fine with fluorescent lights or LED. The fan control switch is designed for fans only and shouldn't be used for lights. On/Off and Dimming switches report their status to the controller but Fan Control doesn't. It's a major disadvantage. The other even more serious issue with Fan control is that medium and low speeds can't be adjusted and set far too low. All fans I have tried just stopped spinning on low and most of them didn't spin even on medium settings. One minor complain for all GE switches. It would be nice if they could measure and report power usage. FYI. This is a newer version of GE switches with Neutral wire.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Solid Z-wave switch with Z-wave plus,4.0 ,"Arrived earlier than expected. The new Zwave plus switch is the exact same size as the previous model the 12724 and looks identical. The function of the switch feels very solid and the installation was just as easy as always. The additional color faceplace is perfect for those needing light almond colors and matches existing normal switches perfectly.

Works great connected to the hub. Note that this switch must be grounded to operate.,5.0 ,"We have a rental property which has a Smart-Things hub with several lights, an internet connected lock and a moisture sensor connected. I installed the GE Z-Wave smart switch to control a kitchen light. My goal was to have several lights programmed to go on and off while the house is not occupied. I installed this by swapping out a single SPDT switch. That the original switch was not grounded and I installed the Z-Wave switch in the same way that the original switch was wired. I found that in this set-up, it did not work. The GE Z-Wave switch needs to be grounded to function properly. I connected the ground and it worked as expected. The instructions that are packaged with the switch do indicate that it should be wired to Neutral, Hot and Ground.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works with Wink!,5.0 ,"Super Easy install, does require a neutral wire. With the new Wink update 3.3.25 my hub recognized the switch with easy. It replaced a Lutron dimer that caused my fan to hum.

You don't need an electrician to install this switch,4.0 ,"So the first thing I noticed is the offer to have an electrician install this switch for $125. Well, I'm no electrician, but I have done some rewiring in our house throughout the years. Secondly, almost all the products of this type of item sold thru Amazon come with an installation video under the product description. This particular video is very good. After watching it several times I was ready to pull the old switch and install this one. First problem when I pulled the old switch is that the two black lines were not marked for load or line. I have a volt meter and applied power to identify the load and line. The lines snap into the switch very easily and there is a little jumper cable included for the two white neutral wires. After installation I installed the GE smart floodlight bulb and pushed the bottom toggle once and the little blue led indicator on the switch lit. Pulled up my Wink hub and it recognized the switch and bulb. Told Alexa to turn the light on and voila it worked. I then told Alexa to turn this light on 30 minutes before sunset and off 30 minutes after sunrise. Will let this run for a few days and if there are not any issues I plan to upgrade all my outdoor floodlights to this system. I've also established a floodlight group in the Wink Hub so I can control all lights outside with one command. Happy install everyone.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Ended up returning it and glad I did,5.0 ,"I bought another vendor's zigbee toggle switch on Amazon that was cheaper initially. Ended up returning it and glad I did. This GE unit is of much better quality. Comes with the two short screws usually needed for reattaching the plate (shorter than normal wall plate screws). Also comes with a short pigtail wire for the neutral which is a nice inclusion. Most importantly I was able to insert the wires, tighten the screws and the wires held fast. The cheaper unit (not GE) would not hold the wires tightly and they kept popping out despite tightening the terminal screws as best as I could. Unit is working superbly so far and connected to Samsung Smartthings without a hitch. Very pleased. Will be buying more of these.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Nice product... works well with SmarThings.,4.0 ,"I have been looking for Z-wave fan control for a while. The other model available is from Leviton which is way more expensive $87 on Amazon. I installed the GE Smart Fan Control switch over the weekend. Since I am an experienced z-wave user (have over 40 devices on SmartThings) the implementation was very straight forward. You do need neutral wire (white) for this switch to work. SmartThings does not recognize this switch as a correct device type automatically. When I first added, this switch was added as a on/off switch. I had remove this device from the network and add again as a GE dimmer. It works fine, with three speed modes available. Operating this switch manually is little bit tricky and need to get use to it. Tapping on switch toggles between on and off. To change speed, one has to hold on (keep switch pressed). Watch the blinking lights to notice the changed speed/mode. I would have been much happier if the correct device type (fan control) was added to smartthings, but am happy to operate it as a dimmer listed.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works well with Smartthings,5.0 ,"Setup is fairly easy, just look at the diagram that comes with it, make sure to connect the neutral wire. I am by no means an experience electrician, in fact, prior to this my only electrical experience was flipping the breaker. Connection to Smartthings: It syncs up with Smartthings pretty easily. I use it in modes (away, home, etc), leak/smoke notifications. Easy peasy. I am not a fan of the price, as it adds up replacing several switches in your house. However, if you want a truly smart house, or smart lighting, I am a believer in smart switches, compared to smart bulbs, which I also own and use.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
It works like a charm,5.0 ,I am using with the Wink home hub. It works like a charm. It DOES take a neutral wire. I tried without the neutral and it would not even turn on at all. I saw reviews that said the neutral was not required but that is not the case. There were neutral wires in the box so I was ok. Switch came with a neutral jumper. My switch went into a 3 gang box. It was a little tight in the box but nothing major. I did move this to the middle of the 3 switches. It is about the same size as a GFCI outlet.

Outstanding and great function,5.0 ,"Let me say I love my switches and dimmers so far and am ordering more - only to see they're out of stock. I control my outdoor kitchen with them and looking to add more functionality to my home. I use a Samsung SmartThings hub and apparently they are also compatible with ADT Pulse. Issues raised by others, valuable to know: YES you need a neutral wire in your box to operate the devices. They need power for the z-wave electronics, there's no way around this unless someone develops a battery powered version. YES they are large and did not fit in my original switch box. I replaced it with a conventional box and all is good. YES I had issues pairing, but it wasn't that difficult and it wasn't anything difficult to resolve. For those who have issues pairing or keeping the device paired, it could be a signal strength issue. I had this behavior with a garage door opener. I added a device between my hub and the garage and the problem was solved - it extended the z-wave mesh for a reliable connection. Overall highly recommended. I just read the first 20 or so negative reviews and most I suggest discounting.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

I've purchased dozens of these, and have noticed that some of them don't immediately pair - I had to go through the ""Remove"" sequence before I could ""Include"" and successfully pair a few of them.

"Works Great, Instructions are Clear",5.0 ,"So this switch is used in conjunction with a GE 12727 switch in a 3-way setup. Once I figured out that this switch existed it was easy to install it in conjunction with the other GE Z-wave switch. The instructions were very straightforward showing me what a typical 3-way configuration looked like and also the setup with the GE switches. You have to be able to identify which switch has the hot wire and which one just has the two travelers. But if you get it right it works fine. For me it worked the first time. It's actually better than a normal 3-way switch setup because for both switches ""up"" is on and ""down"" is off. With a typical 3-way switch pair one of them is always on when the switch is down.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Great switch! I have it connected with my instance ...,5.0 ,"Great switch! I have it connected with my instance of OpenHAB and it works beautifully - OpenHAB found the device in no time and setup was a breeze. The only complaint / discomfort that I have with this switch is that every time it triggers, there's an audible click. It's not that big of a deal, but if you want absolute silence, you might want to look elsewhere. Another thing that you need to know is that while it's a toggle switch, the switch lever never leaves the center. You pull it up / down to turn on / off the lights and the lever comes back to the center position. Other than that, I absolutely love it and would highly recommend P.S. word of caution, this switch REQUIRES neutral (white) wire.

Add-on has no night light; GE12723 add-on compared to Linear WT00Z add-on switch,4.0 ,"The add-on switch works fine. Beware that unlike the GE12722 3way switch or dimmer switch, the add-on switch does not have the LED light on the bottom so you can find it in the dark. I find this very handy and miss this feature. Note that the Linear WT00Z add-on switch DOES have the LED night light, although it is not interchangeable with the GE 12723 in terms of wiring. The GE 12723 requires a traveler from the master switch. The WT00Z does not require a traveler, just line and neutral, which can be a big advantage if you are adding a remote 3way switch, since you do not need wire connecting master and add-on. To use WT00Z with GE switch, pair both with SmartThings controller. Then use WT00Z with Smart Lighting app to control the GE or any other switch. Basically, the WT00Z can act as a one button scene controller and remotely control a GE switch or whatever group of devices you like. The WT00Z has radio built in, unlike the GE 12723 add-on switch, which is designed to work specially with the GE 3way or dimmer switches via the traveler wire.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
only way to go,5.0 ,"This was easy to wire up and linked right up to my ADT pulse system. 3 wires blk hot wht common & green neutral. This again like I have posted on other Z-Wave products I have bought on Amazon was a lot less expensive than what ADT would charge you for the EXACT same item. In fact this item was not even offered to me when ADT updated my system, probable because they are not electricians and it is much easier & profitable to just sell you their adapter that plugs into your existing outlet no electrician needed. I bought one of those when they upgraded my system because I was not informed that the GE Z- Wave receptacle even existed other wise I would have gone that route instead, It is a much cleaner custom look than their plug-in. There is NOTHING wrong with the plug-in in fact you might like the fact that it is NOT hard wired in you can move it around the house anywhere you like.

Work Very Well - but you might need to break down and get assistance to install,5.0 ,"I am very happy with my switches, I now have a half dozen of these installed all talking perfectly with my SmartHub. I wanted to echo Jonathan Birge's sentiments (in the helpful comments section for this product) that these can be somewhat challenging to install. I installed the first couple myself and they worked perfectly. Then I ordered more switches and was almost immediately stumped by my 1976 home's wiring. I'm no slouch for simple electrical tasks but these are not a simple one-for-one swap for your existing switches. I have no problems working my way through a 3 way switch installation (hint: just draw it out on a piece of paper), but I do confess that the need for neutral lines and my desire to stay in code and not crossfeed my circuits had me resort to finally calling a local electrician.

Great Switch - But Watch The Face Plate Screws,4.0 ,"These switches work great! Before you buy, look at the wiring in the box for the switch you are about to replace and make sure that there is a Neutral wire in the box. This switch will not work without a neutral wire. Also, make sure you know which wire is the Load (goes to the light) and which wire is the Line (always hot and comes from the breaker panel). Use a meter to be sure. This switch requires that Neutral, Line, and Load are all connected to the correct terminals on the switch. Also, if you do not want to use the white cover plate screws that come with the switch, you *must* shorten your current plat crews (as others have noted) [-1/2 star for this]. I think there is a design flaw in the switch. Regardless, most off the shelf wire strippers have a bolt cutter built into them (http://www.amazon.com/Tools-VISE-GRIP-Stripper-Crimper-2078309/dp/B000JNNWQ2/ref=sr_1_1?s=power-hand-tools&ie=UTF8&qid=1440418485&sr=1-1&keywords=wire+strippers).

Clean install and works great with ADT Pulse,5.0 ,"I bought 3 of these GE/ Jasco z-wave on/off switches and all of them work great so far. I ran into some wiring challenges with two switches that I wanted to replace, so had to ditch self-install and call an electrician to get the neutrals properly fished out and connected. Once wired in, the switches were instantaneously discovered by the z-wave hub I have a NETGear router hub that is z-wave enabled; provided by ADT for their Pulse security system. The GE 45609 switches are in ADT's approved list of devices and I am able to control the switches using my Pulse android app. If you have ADT Pulse with at least one automation device - lamp modules, switches, thermostats etc. - then you don't need to buy another z-wave hub and you don't need to pay ADT for adding more z-wave devices to your mesh network. I believe ADT needs to initially enable z-wave connectivity in your router/ account; hence the dependency on having at least one automation device. You may be able to get z-wave activated without purchasing a unit by calling their customer service, but I cannot comment on the success rate of that. The documentation that comes with the switch is not very crisp about how to get it in 'discovery' mode for pairing with the hub. I enabled 'search' in the hub and tapped the switch a few times and it did the trick. For installation in older gang boxes, you may need to creatively route the existing wires to accommodate the depth of the switch without shorting any contacts. Also, if you plan to install more than one in a switch box, you will likely need to break off the metal tabs on either side of the switch. If you rock those tabs gently with pliers, they come off cleanly. Noticed recently that Lowes sells a variant of this switch for their Iris platform, under the series number 45637 for around $35. While superficial analysis makes me think that it is the exact same switch as the 45609, I will need to try one to confirm; will post an update when I do so.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

I recently installed a Schlage door lock in anticipation for my kids starting to walk home from school as they get older. I wanted to get notifications when someone unlocked the door via the keypad. To get things operating correctly, I had to add some switches to extend the Z-Wave signal to the front door.

These never lose connection and work perfectly. The blue light on them is not intrusive and even works well in a bedroom. The only thing I wish these had was the ability to send status without being polled (I guess another company holds the patent for that). Sometimes the wink does not see them as being off, and therefore doesn't trigger the activity I have set when one of them is turned off for a few seconds, when it is manually turned off.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Works great (once wired correctly),5.0 ,"Great product to fit into your Z wave implementation (I have ADT Pulse), especially if you have CFL bulbs. This switch requires a common wire connection (it uses the line and common to power the switch). Note that most houses only wire light switches with two wires (the line power coming into the switch, and the load wire going off to the light), while the ""common"" wire, which returns from the light, is typically bundled in the back of the box with all the other common wires. I had to make a trip to the hardware store to buy some wire (12 AWG white) to tap into that common wire bundle and connect to the switch. Note also that the line (power) and load (to lights) wires must be connected in the right spots as well. Took me an hour the first time because I had no clue about the wiring or what I had or needed... and it didn't work.

GE Add-On Switch - Need Wire Nut Connector for Installation (Not Included In Package),5.0 ,"This review is specifically for the GE Add-On Switch, which is needed in 3-way and 4-way setups along with the primary GE Z-Wave on/off or dimmer switches. I've purchased several of these for multiple 3-way and 4-way configurations in my home, and they work great. My main reason in posting this review is to reiterate one important thing about the install that is not mentioned enough in other reviews. You will NEED a wire nut connector for the installation of the Add-On switch. The wire nut connector is NOT included with the package. If you do not have any extra ones around your home, you should buy some to have on hand for installation of the add-on. The add-on switch will be replacing your existing switches in your 3-way/4-way setups, which are likely wired with wires for ground (bare or green), line (black), load (black) and traveler (red). The add-on switch will need wire connections for ground (bare/green), traveler (red) and neutral (new connection, white). The neutral wire is included with the add-on switch and you will need to connect it to your existing neutral wires that should already be in your wall. The add-on does not use the line (black) and load (black) wires. You will need to use the wire nut connector to connect the line and load wires together to complete installation.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Has an oddity where sometimes the light doesn't turn on - or reverses direction vis-a-vis the paddle. Works decently when used with SmartThings/Alexa - but the actual switches themselves leave a lot to be desired. Lutron one looks like it's got a better approach to dimming the light from switch...

It is super annoying, and other reviewers have had the same issue. None of the other GE switches that I have used have the same delay.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
GE Z-Wave Duplex,5.0 ,"I purchased the receptacle so I could operate a lamp through my Honeywell Lynx 5100 security system with a Z-wave card at our second home. I had a few issues with the pairing (operator error) as the button is meant to be pushed on/off instead of holding it down during the pairing. Once I figured that out, the pairing was easy and it is working as designed. Please be aware that the literature say that it needs to be within 10 feet of the hub during pairing. My installation was closer to 15 feet but it worked. A few other observations/comments: - Only one of the receptacles is controlled, the other remains hot at all times - The blue LED is very bright. If you are using it in a bedroom and are sensitive to light, it may bother you - Wire nuts are included - It has a big footprint so it will not work in a small outlet box and may present an issue if ganged. - You need a neutral (white wire) I may purchase a few more for other lamps.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Smart Home Superstar!,5.0 ,"This product ( GE Lighting Control On/Off Switch, Z-Wave, In-Wall, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12722 ) works flawlessly with my Wink Hub 2 and 2nd Gen Echo Dot (Alexa). The only potential downside, for anyone with an older house, is that a neutral wire is required at the switch box for installation. I am not an electrician or contractor, but the included instructions provide a clear guide to installation. I have installed this switch both as a stand-alone and with two of the GE add-on switches ( GE Add-On Switch for Z-Wave, ZigBee and GE Bluetooth Wireless Lighting Controls, 12723 ) in a 4-way switch configuration, with no problems whatsoever (other than figuring out how my wiring was run). There is a split-second delay as the relay is activated, but I find this acceptable. The small blue LED at the botton of the switch lights up when the switched light is off, and goes dark when the switched light is on. I believe this behavior can be altered by the user, although I have not tried to do so. The switch does not dim, it is simply on/off. (For an excellent smart home dimmer switch, I definitely recommend the Lutron Caseta Wireless In-Wall Dimmer, 600/150-Watt, Single Pole, Works with Amazon Alexa .) Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and recommend it highly for anyone embarking on a smart home journey.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works exactly as you'd hope.,5.0 ,"I bought several of these to automate the lights for a friend's house (we bought her an Echo and Wink Hub at the same time). These are as easy to install and setup as any light switch, simply unscrew the old one and screw in the new one. It's worth noting that the switch itself doesn't move from an up to a down position or vice versa like a traditional switch would. The switch sticks out at 90 degrees to the wall. Flipping it up turns the lights one and down off, but once you've moved the switch, a spring returns it to the neutral center position (like a joystick).","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
These switches work great!,5.0 ,"I have placed quite a few of these in my house, I am controlling them with a VeraLite Zwave controller. The installation of these units was very easy, pairing them was super simple, and they work and look great! I just found out today that they are persistent through a power outage (if the lights were on, they will stay on when the power is restored) and they connected back up with my VeraLite with no issues immediately when power was restored. They have also done a good job of repeating the Zwave signal improving the reliability of some door and window sensors that I had previously installed farther away from my base unit. They just work, no magic voodoo required. I like these switches and will be purchasing more over time.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Great remote light control,5.0 ,"After switching my security company to ADT for their ""Pulse"" service, I had home automation as part of the package. ADT supplies you with only one indoor appliance plug and the rest of the automation is up to you. I had 2 areas in the house that I thought could benefit from Automation. One the Lighting switch is not easily accessible and the other was for a light that we had to remember to turn it on each night and turn it off in the morning. It did the trick for both of them. The scheduled one more so than the inaccessible one. As I had to log in with my user name and password to ADT iPhone app to turn on and off the light it is not the most convenient thing ever. However for the light that needs to go on at night and off in the morning it is working great! Installation was not the easiest for me. I actually thought of returning the package as I thought I could never get it working. My old switch had only 2 wires (Both Black) one was the input and the other was the load. The Z switch needed also an neutral wire. None of my current switches appears to have the ground wire installed!. After realizing that there is actually a Neutral (White) wire bundle in my switch box, a short trip to HOME DEPOT to be that wire for less than a dollar it worked. You need to follow the diagram. The Black input in my switch box came from a black wire bundle. The Neutral goes to a White wire bundle and the Load was a singe wire not attached to a bundle. The difference between this switch and conventional light switches is that this switch is Active (it needs to be powered on by it's own supply). Whereas the conventional switches are there just to interrupt the circuit or connect it. It is bulkier than conventional switches so if you have a crowded box there is a lot of wires to be pushed back. All in all we really like it. I would have given it 4.5 stars not five. It does the trick and does it well. It also works as a Z-wave repeater making it easier to cover dead spots in your household. I already installed 2 of those and debating installing the third.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
This is my go-to z-wave switch!,5.0 ,"I have installed three of these thus far ... one controlling 7 CFL down-lights in our eaves ... one controlling the outdoor outlet for our Christmas lights (LED) ... and one that controls the lights on our back patio (incandescent) ... so I can therefore verify that they work well with all three types of bulbs. If you've ever installed a light switch before, then you find that this switch installs quite easily, as long as you have a neutral in your switch box ... in my experience, this has been a bundle of white wires in the back of the box, all connected by a single wire nut, so it's pretty easy to use a loose piece of wire to connect the neutral lug on the switch to this bundle. The neutral is required because this switch has a relay in it, which is why it will work well with CFL and LED lights, and also why it will make a small click noise when it actuates. Some reviews have mentioned the blue LED. For all three of the installations mentioned above, I chose to set the LED so that it is on when the switch is on (the opposite of the default) because I prefer to have an indication of the switch's status and this is more intuitive to me. For indoor lights, you might prefer to leave the default setting, making it easier to find the switch in the dark. I have had no issues adding these to my controller (Vera Lite), but like any z-wave device you may have to remove them and re-add to get them to work. I'm sure I'll be adding several more of these to my house ...","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
I use to to turn my window unit (A/C) off if I forget to turn it off before I leave,5.0 ,"I had this installed in my living room because I kept forgetting to turn the A/C (window unit) off. We'll this fixed that problem right up! Now I can turn it off from my phone if I leave for work and remember I forgot it on. The only kind of annoying thing about using this method is that to turn the A/C back on I have to open the app on my phone and turn the switch back on. Which is OK I guess because at least it provides me with what I need for the purpose I wanted it for. Also, keep in mind you'll need a hub to make this work. I use the SmartThings hub. I know it will also work with the Wink hub and if you have a Vivint Sky Panel (security alarm) it works with that too. Another thing to note is only the bottom plug is a ""smart"" plug. The top plug is a regular outlet.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Let There Be Light.,4.0 ,"Functionally, this works great. It's connected to my Wink hub and has worked fine for the few months I've had it. It was fairly simple to wire up, and with some mashing, the wires and switch fit just fine into the gang box. I'm not so great about the switch portion itself. It doesn't look like a normal switch and it'll stick out like a sore thumb in a multiple-gang arrangement. The on/off action is also considerably different than your run-of-the-mill switch. The above isn't a huge thing, but I like things to match and blend in. This doesn't. Maybe it's a limitation of the technology, I don't know. Just wanted people to be aware.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Good switch, but missing a key feature",4.0 ,"These switches work very well, so far inclusion to the Z-Wave network has been easy and consistent. For those doing DIY like myself (Raspberry Pi 3 with HomeGenie), one important issue with this switch is that it does not support the Association command class. This means that it does not send a status update to your controller when manually operated (by that I mean, physically turning a light off or on with the switch rocker). It does send out a NodeInfo frame, however, so I was able to work around it with a program instead of constantly polling it. Other than that, they are good switches, and will likely buy more of them since the price is reasonable and they seem well made.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
so far so good!,5.0 ,"I bought these because they were the only z-wave switches I found that actually rock both up and down which to me is intuitive. One big surprise is that people all across the internet state that GE/Jasco switches do not provide instant feedback/notification when operated manually. I can tell you that is false. I have 1 Jasco and 3 GE branded units and all send notices to my phone the instant the relay kicks in the light and yes, I'm taking about when I press the button on the switch. I use Girder 6, from Promixis with an Aeon Labs Z-stick to run my network and I do have polling set to one minute however I can stand there and flip the switch on and off and see every single change which is not possible with polling. You can also reverse the way the status led works on them to have it come on when the switch is on if you want. If they hold up and continue to work like they do now I'll be extremely happy with them. The only thing I didn't like was the size of the internal housing and the recessed screw terminals but I managed to get them in the box.

Had some problems with wall plates intallation and 12724 didn't work correctly with Wink Hub.,3.0 ,I bought 12724 and 12723 versions. The add-on works fine and was easy to install. The problem was with 12724. The Wink Hub couldn't turn it off correctly. Every time I was trying to turn off the fight the hub was lowering the brightness and then turning lights off. I was needed the dimming functionality for now and decided to install a stitch. The switch is much louder but it least it works fine. Then I had some difficulties to install the wall plates.

Easy compatibility with Front Point Security,5.0 ,"Once the system saw the switch, it started functioning perfectly. Being able to turn table lamps on and off remotely is good, but I've always thought that anyone casing the neighborhood would more likely think there really might be someone at home if ceiling lights could join in. This switch accomplishes that. If you are at all handy around the house, you should be able to install this switch yourself. Be prepared to wrestle the wires a bit, because like most fancy function switches this thing bulks large in the switch box. It takes some maneuvering and a little bit of muscle to get the wires in and then have the face plate set level with the wall. There are two ongoing features of this switch that you should know about. One is that it has a blue LED monitor light. I can't remember what the function of it is, but it stays on all night. It sheds very, very little light, but it does give out some and you have to live with that. The other thing that takes a little getting used to is that it switches the current electronically, so it doesn't have the usual ""snick"" when you push it on or off. When you press the switch, what's happening is that you are actually pressing a micro switch that signals the electronics to switch the current. There's nothing wrong with that, but every time I press the switch I still notice that it doesn't feel or sound the same as the other switches in my house. I'm thinking I'll get another one or two of these. But maybe that's just the geek in me that thinks it's neat that I can turn on the lights from a couple of thousand miles away.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Works good with Aeon Labs Z-Stick,5.0 ,"I'm not an electrician but I am not a stranger to installing light switches. Everything worked good but some things to keep in mind. 1st of all this thing goes pretty deep into the electrical boxes. So deep that if I want to add anymore to my home I will be forced to switch out the original metal box that's there now. Where I installed this switch the in wall box was already switched to a plastic one when we remodeled the house so I had no issues there. The fact I have I'm going to have to switch out the in wall metal boxes to deeper plastic ones if I want to add more of these to my home, isn't the fault of the switch. It's just the time period of when the house was built, so I won't lower my rating of this product because of it. Like the other reviewers have said. You need to make yourself a little negative (White) jumper from the switch to the bundled negative wires and wire nut them all together to make this switch work. Normally this doesn't need to be done with regular switches where you would just bundle all the negative wires together and wire nut them. Also you have to split up the main power and the power going to the light on the switch as well. Once I read the directions and had to turn the power off and on several times to find which wire was main power, it was easy. I had someone helping me so I wouldn't have to keep running back to the electrical box. One more thing to add is the screws themselves on this switch were extremely hard to break free. Almost feels like they are glued in place for some reason LOL. Once I broke them free it was easy but man, get ready to use some muscle to break them free. Also, other reviewers have added that when you put the wire in the back of the switch that these are not the push type. You must push the wire into place and screw down the corresponding screws to securely lock the wires into place. Other version of normal switches allow you to just push the wire in and it will hold, this is not the case with this light switch. Once setup, the switch buttons take some getting used to but once you get used to it, its not bad. They don't actually toggle up or down like a normal switch. Its more like a push button. Setting up with z wave was easy. Using Aeon DSA02203-ZWUS Labs Z-Wave Z-Stick Series 2 USB Dongle as my controller. Put the Z-Stick into add mode. The directions for the switch to add the zwave switch to a controller is press on or off on the switch with the z wave controller in add mode. The z-stick added the device right away with no issues. Using the Aeon Labs Z-Wave Z-Stick, and InControl Home Automation software for my setup with no issues. Even with all its minor problems it still functions perfectly and will buy more soon! Update 8-12-13 Purchased another for the kitchen and works perfectly as the 1st one does.

My favorite Z-wave on/off wall switch.,5.0 ,"My favorite Z-Wave on/off wall switches. I like them for a few reasons. First, they seem more ""solid"" than competing switches. Second, I like the way they get wired in -- rather than rat tail wires that you connect to the Romex in the J-Box, these have little holes like outlets do, that you insert the Romex wires into. Seems more secure, and takes up less room in the box. Third, and most importantly, they are instant status with HomeSeer, which isn't the case for competing switches from Linear. The LED is blue. Which is cool, but for the fact that all other manufacturers use green LEDs, so be careful mixing these with other manufacturers in the same J-Box if you want a consistent look.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Make sure you have a white nutral wire!!!,3.0 ,"I bought 3 of these units to control the lights in my kitchen. Replacing the switches that controlled the lights above my kitchen island and the bank of lights (3 spots) above my cabinets had no problems and work well. These switches require a nutral white wire be connected so that the switch can be powered on continously. When I tried to replace the switch that controlled the bank of lights above my counter, the original switch just had the black power wire with no white common wire in the box, and the smart switch wouldn't work. I tried running the white common wire from an adjacent power plug but that didn't work either. Maybe the issue was because all of this wiring was behind a GFI. So the lesson here is, before ordering this item, inspect the wiring of where you plan on installing this switch to insure that a white common wire is present. In my situation all my kitchen lights are now controlled by Alexa except for this one bank of lights which is still manual.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Great Switch with Toggle - Works without Controller,5.0 ,"Works great. Toggle stays in the middle, a little different, but gets the job done well without having to replace all the covers. I prefer the way it looks over the decora switches. Paired perfectly with my Veraplus controller and add-on switch to make it a three way. Wires completely different than a regular three way switch, so pay attention. Had both old switches replaced, paired and working in about 30 minutes. The best thing about these is they work with or without your controller being online. Mine fit in a standard plastic box that was original to a 1990 home.

Good zwave switch and easy to install,5.0 ,"I've used many of these and I like this one for the price. It seems to be as well made as any other Zwave switch I have used and is cheaper than all of them. This device requires power in the box to power the control and a switch leg to switch. So basically, you need a neutral, hot, and switch in the box. I like the blue LED that lets you know where the switch is in the dark. It is not too bright and not too soft. When you first get these, screw the screws in slightly. They will feel tight like they are already screwed down, but they are screwed all the way out. So screw them in slightly maybe a quarter turn before hooking up. Be careful as this type of connector can be easily stripped. That would be my only complaint but the GE are like that too. ---------- Update- I said in my earlier review that the switch was cheaper than the GE. But now that Lowes sells GE, the GE is much cheaper. These units are still working fine, but for almost 8 dollars a piece cheaper elsewhere, I've changed brands.

Works fantastic with ADT Pulse,5.0 ,"Got two of these to integrate into my new ADT Pulse system. It took me a second to realize that I needed to wire up the included wire to the neutral line (normal light switches don't switch the neutral on and off -- so it's just sitting bundled up in the back of the box behind the existing switches). I wired up the switches to an existing light switch near the antenna/z-wave base, then logged into Pulse and matched it up. Then moved the switch to the final location and did a ""Refresh"" on the z-wave system. Works great. Scheduling and automation are fantastic. I have my porch lights turn on when it gets dark, and turn of at 1am, and I have my garage light turn on when I open the garage door, and turn of automatically 10 minutes later, so someone doesn't forget.

Amazing product - but be aware that these REQUIRE a neutral wire.,5.0 ,Works perfectly!!! I have three of these connected to a Smartthings home automation network. They work perfectly and integrate with Smartthings immediately. That said - please note that you MUST have a neutral wire running to these units for them to operate. (That is typically the white wires that are grouped all together and stuffed in the back of the electrical box) My switches did not previously use a neutral wire - so getting this working meant that I needed to dig out those wires and add an additional white wire from the unit to the group of neutral wires.

Just missed a 5-star,4.0 ,"I use this with a Piper security system as the controller. It was hard to pair with the Piper but that seems to be true of every Z-Wave device used with Piper. Switch, Piper and wireless router all need to be in the same room to get Piper to recognize the switch - tough to do. TIP: pulsing the switch on and off seemed to help Piper find the switch. One button push didn't work for me. I think it is not the GE switch's fault. Anyway now that it is paired, it all works perfectly. The switch controls our porch light and is set to turn on and off at times I can set via the Piper app. If I don't have my phone handy, I can turn the light on and of with the mechanical switch. One more thing - the screws that hold the bare AC wire in the switch are somewhat tricky to use. It took several tries to get one of the wires to be firmly secured in the switch terminal.

Before you learn ANY new Z-Wave Device into the Network, you must first DELETE it. It does not matter if the product is brand new or used, doing this will eliminate any potential problems. The second tip is to make sure and have a load plugged into the controlled outlet.. If you use a lamp, make sure there is a light bulb in it. Pretty much any non motor appliance / device will work (no vacuum cleaners). Many Z-Wave 110v devices require this to delete or learn the item in / work properly.

Love this product,5.0 ,"Love this product. I bought it in order to link my LED down lights (purchased from HomeDepot) to my Smarthings Hub, which is connected to my Google Home. Now I can get home and say, ""Hey Google, turn on my kitchen (living room) lights"" and it works! I bought two; one form my living room lights and the other for the kitchen, and I plan on buying another to be able to control the study and front porch lights the same way.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
This outlet was easy to install,5.0 ,"I bought these as I have an ISY 994 with Z-Wave capability but had never used the Z-Wave capability. All of my switches and outlets to this point are made by Insteon. However, I will probably be switching out to the Z-Wave from this point forward. This outlet was easy to install, was labelled nicely with an easy to read legend, and worked right out of the box when it was paired to my system. The quality of the hardware is very good, especially when I compare it to some of the Insteon outlets I have received of late that have failed to work right out of the box. If you are a packaging freak, you will appreciate the nicely apportioned box the unit comes in, especially the extra white neutral wire provided. As mentioned in other reviews, follow the instructions contained in the box and you shouldn't have any problems.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Excellent product - works great with SmartThings - not simple to install,4.0 ,"I recently purchased and installed two of these smart switches for my SmartThings home automation system to control a porch ceiling light and an entry hall ceiling light. One is dimmable and I installed it as a 3-way switch using the GE 12728 Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control add-on switch and the other is a simple, non-dimmable off/on smart switch. Despite some significant challenges in getting the 3-way set-up installed properly it is all working perfectly and I am very pleased. I would definitely buy more - in fact I probably will as I further develop my home automation. Integration with SmartThings (v. 2 hub) went flawlessly. I like especially that via SmartThings ""SmartLighting"" app I can easily set the dimmer level (e.g. to 30%) when the lights come on. As mentioned, my only real problem was to figure out how to wire the 3-way switch set-up correctly. I did finally get it working correctly (at one point I figured I would have to break down and call an electrician but pushed thru and figured it out) but it took a long time and a good bit of trial and error. The instructions are accurate but for me in any case I had to carefully read them over and over and go step by step. I did find a great YouTube video tutorial that was excellent and got me on the right track: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1luE9llSQ What I discovered to be the cause of my troubles with the wiring (besides the fact that I'm not an electrician!) was that the 3-way switch I was replacing had been wired in a non-standard way. It ended up to be critical for me to figure out which switch I was replacing was the 'line' or 'primary' switch and which was the 'load' or 'add-on' switch. Once I had that then both the YouTube video tutorial and the manual made good sense. Oh well, along the way I feel like I earned an 'amateur electrician' certification and saved a bundle by not having to bring in an electrician. But for the feint of heart, and if your home wiring is a bit complex, you might just want to pay to have someone else do it. This difficulty with the installation is the ONLY reason I didn't give this a 5-star review.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Professional, good-looking lighting control for home-automation system",5.0 ,"It's a bit tricky to install, particularly into a switch box with other switches. In a single-gang box, it would be very easy. In a multi-gang box, you will definitely need to break off the tabs on the edges (they are designed to do this when necessary). The terminal screws don't loosen very far, so getting the wires looped around them takes patience and a little bit of brute force. Probably a good idea to have some form of external lighting available (battery powered on an extension cable to a different circuit), since you will have turned off the breaker to this circuit and will likely have killed other forms of nearby lighting in the process. Once installed, it programs readily into the z-wave controller console and does exactly what you expect it to do. I'm very pleased with it - it blends precisely with the other light switches in the box and doesn't look odd in any way.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"High-quality receptacle, physical configuration could be more flexible",4.0 ,"I have purchased and installed three of these. So far I have been impressed with the build quality and operation. I would comment that the Z-Wave range seems to be more limited than an external plug-in module, especially when mounted in a metal electrical box. If you are planning to use this to automate a night light, be aware that most night lights on the market are designed to plug into the top outlet, leaving the bottom outlet free. On this unit, the bottom outlet is controlled by Z-Wave and the top outlet is an AC pass-through. Since most night lights are also polarized, it is not possible to plug the night light into the bottom outlet ""upside down"" to avoid blocking the top outlet and the push-button. So you end up plugging it right-side up into the bottom outlet, which essentially blocks the top outlet and the push-button.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works as intended with some significant shortcomings.,3.0 ,"I bought 3 switches that I connected to an openhab with z-stick. These are my impressions: - One of the 3 switches was DOA, but Amazon rushed a replacement the next day. props to them for the responsiveness. - The switches have a very short reception range. I experimented and found significant drops at 30 feet. This was true of all 3. - The switches don't report to the master node when the state changes, so I had to set up a refresh polling every 60 seconds. This may be a deal breaker if you own any battery powered z-wave devices in your network. Overall these devices do what they promise with the limitations I mentioned.

Nice look and Works well with Wink Hub,5.0 ,"I am very happy with these switches. I purchased 3 of them for use in my home. They were easy to install, but I wasn't used to connecting the white common wire to a light switch. At first I just connected the line and load (black) connections and the switch didn't work. I was disappointed, then I read the instructions (lol). The white common is needed to make these switches work in addition to line and load. Once that was done, they easily integrated with my Wink Hub. The blue led is a plus. They are very easy to locate in a darkened room and provide visible status to outdoor lighting.

I like it because it allowed for me to add some smart switches without changing my entire home's switches to paddle style which would have been very costly. Users should be cautioned, that since these are smart switches, they require constant power and therefore need a neutral wire. Inspect your current gangbox and switch and verify you have a neutral available to run a jumper to before ordering these switches.

super easy,5.0 ,"I had this installed in 10 minutes simply took the Black wire Hot off old switch and placed it on new terminal marked for it. the othe black wire going to the lights I put on the ""load"" terminal marked as well and I added a pigtail to the existing white wires AKA commons to the Zwave marked common. This also had the traveler terminal but was taped over to be removed only if using as a 3 way switch. Mine was not, simply a switch in one place only. You must install the white wire as the unit needs power of its own to work. I have done alot of my own wiring and I have an old house so I often would feed the switch after the the light rather than through the switch box which is great but in that case you would not have a white wire to use as a common. I refer to this as a switch leg not sure what electricians call it. I enrolled or learned it in to a Lynx touch L5100 alarm system with a zwave module. Saw it once I activated it. I edited its name description and all is done. I will be controlling this via Smart phone and or Ipad app total connect 2 in the Automation tab. I have a very large garage 50 feet detached and I put this switch out there so some light would be on when I pulled in or anytime i wanted without going out to do it. So this unit is seen or linked in an exterior building. I was concerned as it isnt far but with walls and such ...it works perfect. This zwave technology will get easier and less expensive.

Hooked on Automation,5.0 ,"These were the first ""Hard Wired"" add-ons to my Smartthings & Echo setup. I started to install them myself but then called an electrician friend because the wiring where I was installing these was not as straight forward as I expected. After watching him pop these in, in under 5 minutes each I think I could have done it had I just thought it through. Both the Smartthings Hub and Amazon Echo identified these almost immediately and the setup and customization was quick and straight forward. I was able to rename them, customize icons, create groups, create proximity scenarios i.e when family pulls into driveway, driveway light and front door light turn on. I also created situation that can be activated via Amazon Echo, for instance if I say ""Alexa, turn on emergency lights"" all my exterior lights turn on.

I gave it 4 stars because it was more complicated ...,4.0 ,"I gave it 4 stars because it was more complicated wiring them up (4 way) and the instructions were not very clear I finally figured it out - and once you understand what is going on with these switches, it makes sense (forget about what you already know about your typical 3 way and 4 way switch wiring) In my situation I wanted to replace 3 switches that controlled our stairway lights. So I purchased one 12722 on.off switch and two 12723 add on switches. Think of the 1272 as the 'Master' switch because it is basically doing all the work. The add on switches just send a signal down one of the traveler wires to the Master switch to tell it to turn on or off The Master Switch has (4) Connections - when you look at the back of the switch they are: E...(top left)...... ""Load"" - power out to the light F...(top right)..... ""Traveler"" - this is where the add on switches are connected to C...(lower left).... ""Line"" - power in from the breaker B...(neutral)....... ""Neutral"" The Add On switch only have two connections DD...Top.....Traveler wire back to the Master Switch BB...Bot.....Neutral So once you figure out your Line In and Load out, it is fairly simple to wire up. In my situation I had (3) locations - left middle right Power came into the box on the left (Line) and power went out to the light from the box on the right (Load). I wanted to put the Master switch in the box on the right (GE Recommends to put it in the middle if you can) but my middle box was crammed full of wires and I didn't want to deal with it. The three boxes are connected with each other with 3 wires - red, black and white. Since my power was coming in to the box on the left and I wanted it to go to the box on the right, I jumpered the two black wires togethor in both the left and middle box - that way Line was passed directly to the box on the right. The two add on switches were going in to the box on the left and the middle box. They each take two wires - a neutral and a traveler wire. NOTE - THEY CAN USE THE SAME TRAVELER WIRE!. So in the box on the left I had a red wire which I connected to the add on the switch. In the middle box, I connected the two red wires together with a wire nut and added a jumper to connect to that Add On Switch and in the box on the right I connected the red traveler wire to the traveler connection on the Master switch. Again - the Add On boxes can use the same Traveler wire since they only send a control signal down that wire to the Master Switch when you turn one of the add on boxes off or on EDIT to ADD: I have an older Z-Wave network that uses mostly Intermatic Devices that I bought from Amazon in 2008! I am also using ""Think Essentials"" software from Control Think (out of business now) that runs on my home server as the Primary Controller. I am happy to report that I was able to easily add this newer switch to my existing Z-Wave Network - works great :)","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Good so far, and a fairly decent value",4.0 ,"I installed two of these last week. So far they work great. Perhaps I could grouse about the price, but considering that an outlet with USB charging ports runs about $21, the $37 for this Z-Wave switch isn't too much of a stretch. What I would've liked for the price is for it to come with wire nut or two like the Cooper Wiring dimmer switch did (although that was $56). A short stretch of bare copper wire for the ground would've been nice, too. There is a delay when tapping the switch, I'd guess 200-300 milliseconds. It's not too bad. What I really like about these ""smart"" switches is that when configured multi-way, the switch positions don't get out of sync. In a 3-way configuration, having both switches ""on"" while the light is off gets on my nerves! (Other folks with OCD can relate, I'm sure.)

"works fine, but ground screw is in a ridiculous location.",3.0 ,"This switch works as advertised (I use it with tube SmartThings 2 Hub). However, the designers located the ground screw on the top of the thing's body. This means that you need to remove the ground screw in order to get it to fit in some plastic boxes (the heavy duty gray ones in particular), thus creating a safety hazard and code violation. This was simply a poor design choice, as there is no functional reason fir such a location.

"Series 300 Z-wave Not Series 500. If you can wait for the new model, I suggest waiting.",4.0 ,"Approximately two years ago, Zwave came up with a new standard. It is called, Series 5/Series 500/Zwave Plus. It is a major improvement over series 300 products. That being said, this is one of my favorite Wave 300 light switches. It works great for for a series 300 product. One thing that none of the other manufacturers mention is that all switches except of this one and the Homeseer switch don’t update the controller instantly about that status of the switch being on or off. This one updates instantly. This can be very convenient. For example if you want to open your garage door or turn on other lights when you manually turn this light switch on. The problem with the Homeseer switch is this feature on updating the controller instantly is claimed to currently only works with the Homeseer controllers. Some people are working on some plugins for the Vera to work with the Homeseer switch but I haven’t been able to confirm if they got it working or not. GE has announced a Series 500 version of this switch. They even have the manual online. Unfortunately, it isn’t currently available anywhere that I could find. Unlike other GE/Jasco products, there is no link on their web page to purchase it. I suspect the new model will be out very very soon. Series 500 is night and day better than series 300. It takes away a lot of the aggravation of Series 300. If you can wait a little longer for the new model I would. Overall, I like the quality of this switch. It works great with Vera Plus.

"Works Great, but one thing to think about - the ...",4.0 ,"Works Great, but one thing to think about - the switch itself is really big compared to what it is replacing and getting it back in the electrical box may be a challenge depending on how well your electrician set up the box with wire in the first place. In a standard box it barely fits, then if the wiring is not terminated well in the box, it's a tough fit. If you have a 2 or 3 plate with other switches, good luck getting one of these in there with all the other wiring. I had bought 3, 1 for a single plate and 2 for a 3 plate that controls 2 sets of outside lights, the single was a tight fit and the 3 plate i could only install 1 of these switches because i had to move all of the wiring out from behind this one switch and put it behind the other 2 and that left no room for the other wave switch. The hardest part of installing this was jamming it back in the electrical box and getting the short screws to secure it down, i had to find 2 longer screws to even reach the screw holes in the electrical box. Once in, it works great, but finding it took a little playing around too. I had the blue light on and i selected find things, it spun for 30 minutes and found nothing, then i reset everything and tried again, nothing. Tried again and this time when it was searching I went over and toggled the switch a few times turning the lights on and off and it found it instantly.

Good product,3.0 ,"Great concept, works well with my z-wave controller and smarphone app, however it does not have the blue LED like the primary switch. When you install it in a 2/3/4 gang box, and 1 or more of the others are a primary with the blue LED, it looks like something is wrong with it because there is no blue light. To expand, the blue light is on when the actual light is off. This helps you find it in the dark. So naturally, you start to recognize that a switch without a blue light means the light is on. When you walk by a 3/4 gang box, and want to turn a light on, you tend to look past the switches without a blue light because you (subconsciously) assume it must be on. I end up hitting multiple switches trying to get the right one. And... the overall impression a visitor gets when they see the one switch with no light is that it must be burned out.

Fantastic product but...can take forever to install if you are not electrically savy,5.0 ,"I have this product installed and synced to my Nexia Home Intelligence system. Put the first one on my front house lights and used Nexia to automate the turn off at sunrise and on at sunset. To Sync I simply pressed the plus button on my Nexia gateway, pressed the up on this zwave switch and waited for light to go back to solid...worked first time. Now the install...holy cow did I spend a ton of time on this mainly because of my own ineptitude when it comes to electrical circuitry. Hopefully you can benefit from my folly. -First off, this switch requires a neutral wire. Old homes may not have this. If you don't look at other answered questions to understand how to install or other options. FYI, the neutral wire is most often the white wire in your switch box. In mine there were four neutral wires tied together via wire nut. The easiest way is to buy some 10 gauge romex and just run another wire from the switch to this wire nut. (I of course didn't do it this way, cut one of the wires to short, had to splice up in the wall...blah blah...I hate wires) -Second, if you have everything plugged in and you have cussed at the switch for not working...try switching the load and hot wires (the two black wires). -Third, you must have a proper ground wire.

Great Z Wave Switches!,5.0 ,These switches are perfect for those looking to make their home a smart home. In order for these switches to work you do have to have a Z Wave hub to control them.

Love these. Much better success with my network.,5.0 ,"I have a ton of Z-Wave. No seriously. I have three complete systems going at different locations, probably 100+ light switched, 15 locks, a dozen cameras, outlets etc. I purchased these to put CFL bulbs in some of my locations that don't need dimming and they work perfectly. None of the issues I've run into with the dimming switches (random off/on moments, stopped working at all, random flickering) These just plugged in, connected to the network and worked. You can daisy chain them in the system, I use both Nexia and MiCasaVerde. I have the basement set to come on when the stair lights are turned on and turn off when the stair lights are turned off. The Good: Easy to Connect, works with CFL/LED/Incandescent, No Quirky Issues like the dimmers. The Bad: Hits the checkbook substantially compared to a regular on/off. But the beauty of knowing your lights are all off, or being able to turn on the basement light without actually going down there first (The wife) is a wonderful thing.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Working perfectly for months! Needs neutral...,5.0 ,"Once I was able to connect up the neutral directly, worked like a charm and has been working for a few months now. Would highly recommend, but make sure you connect up the neutral, as most traditional wiring will have all the neutral wires connected together in the back of the junction boxes, as most older switches did not require Just remove the wire nut jumpering all the neutral wires together and connect up the neutral wire using the small jumper wire provided with switch.

If you want to turn the light on/off without the iPhone app you can just touch the button. If you want to turn it on from an outlet you can't reach you can either use the app (SmartThing with Samsung) or if you'd rather just go back to manual, program it to stay on all the time.

Great switch for my Qolsys Security and home automation system.,5.0 ,"Back in the day there was X-10 controllers to do some basic home automation and now there is z-wave. The power and flexibility of z-wave is limitless. I recently decided to upgrade my alarm system and wanted something modern that was able to be controlled remotely as well as provide the backbone for my modern venture into home automation. I needed some basic on/off switches that would work with almost anything and while these were not on the compatibility list for Qolsys they paired and worked flawlessly. They installed well, but if you try to put two in a double gang box you need to break the tabs off the sides so these space well for the face plate to line up.

Turns my lights on instantly and has the proper ""hotel"" connection that you would expect (wired, not wireless).

I have 10 of these units , and a lot of other devices from GE and they all work well once you get them set up.

I haven't used any other switch but I have lots of GE products that run off the ZWAVE tech and I haven't been let down yet. One thing to consider is that the back side of the switch is quite large. It goes much deeper than a regular switch. Be sure you're ready to move a bunch of your wires around to make room for it.

Then it worked perfectly. The second one I couldn't get to pair with my Z-Wave stick. The third one won't turn on at all.

"Good, but two critical things you need to know.",4.0 ,"I bought this switch to use with a Wink Hub and Amazon Echo. Read on for tricks to get it working as I had a few issues before it was working. First, a NEUTRAL wire is required along with the usual LINE and LOAD wires. The next problem I had was that I couldn't get it to pair up with the Wink Hub. I called Wink tech support, got right through and the support person and I finally stumbled upon the proper method to pair it. The switch instructions say to press the light switch handle up and then release. What actually worked was to press the handle up 3 or 4 times in a row and then press the handle down. That worked! Once it was paired with Wink, it was a simple process to get it programmed to turn on and off at sunset/sunrise. Also connecting it to Amazon Echo was easy and it worked the first time.

Couldn't be more pleased,5.0 ,"When hardly anything goes right the first time, I was trilled with this Z-Wave dimmer (single pole) which I am using with my Smartthings V2 Hub. Installation was very straightforward and I found the instructions that were included were very good. Took a little while to pair but eventually did and it works flawlessly. I am amazed with the level of control on the LED Par bulbs (Sylvania/Osram 100 w dimmable warm white). With the old rheostat, there was very little dimming, but with this switch I can take it down to very low levels and still have the LED bulbs work. Very quick response, no delay. Only thing to watch on installation is don't use old switch cover screws (they are too long). Use what comes with the package. When I used the old, long screws, something happened to the operation.

I have been avoiding replacing one of the switches with a Z-Wave switch because I figured I would have to find a cover with two standard switch cut outs and one decora cut out. This switch allowed me to upgrade my front porch light with a z-wave enabled switch without having to redo everything. The switch itself was very easy to get operational and it linked up right away with my Honeywell z-wave controller.

However, I installed a Linear z-wave switch right beside the same location where I installed the duplex outlet and the switch joined no problem.

Simple install,5.0 ,"Easy installation. Just remove the old switch (2 wires) and connect those two wires to the new switch, from the new switch connect the common wire to the common terminal in the switch (this provides the common for the switches internal electronics) and you're done. The hot lead does matter which screw is used, this is because the hot side powers the internal electronics, just like the common. Easy install...nothing to it. Took 5 minutes to install. Connection to my smartthings hub was as simple as pushing ""up"" on the switch and holding it for a second or two (as documented) and telling SmartThings a new switch was available. Took another minute. Easy. In less than 10 minutes my kitchen accent lighting was automated. The switch looks exactly light the photos, the lever is slightly smaller than a traditional switch. It returns to center, so it does not give a visual clue that it is on or off. There is no status light, which might have been a nice addition.

Losing stars as the days go on,3.0 ,"I have 16 of these throughout the house. I've had them for 1-2 years now and have had a few failures. The one in the garage completely stopped working (even though the light indicator was on). The relay must have went bad because toggling the switch there was no relay click. Another one the light indicator stopped working. The switch still works but no led indicator (not a big deal). On two of them in high traffic areas, the plastic on the switch has broken so when you toggle it sometimes the plastic sticks out. All in all haven't had any other issues. I'd recommend it. As others have said, they are bulky. UPDATE (Jul/3/17): After 3 yrs I've started to get a lot of locked up switches that would not turn on or off, even by pressing the switch. I would have to use a screw driver to pop out the little power disconnect to get the switch to respond; after which it would work for 3-9 days before failing randomly (I recorded min and max days per switch).

Works with the Vivint Go!Control Panel,5.0 ,"I have eight of these paired with my Vivint Go!Control panel. The software in the Vivint program allows these or any z-wave switches to respond to sensors, like having the light turn on when a door opens or to respond to an alarm by turning on, or to run off a daily schedule of on-off times. I did have a couple switches that were slow to pair with the controller, just keep turning the switch on and off when your controller is in learn mode until the controller sees it. It may take a dozen times but they all eventually paired up. This was more of a problem the farther the switch was from the controller. Once paired, the controller can then jump signals through other z-wave devices to get to ones that are farther away (the advantage of the mesh network). So, if you have a switch far away from your controller, install other switches in between that run other lights first and then the farther switch can get signals repeated through the other z-wave devices.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
good product,5.0 ,"This is a good product and is priced reasonably. I installed it without any difficulty, however a wiring note. The original switch only used a source or line input and the switch leg or output to light for light to work. These switches because they are electronic switches with additional functions require the common or WHITE wire connected to work as a light switch or a remote switch. This is not a big deal as all house wiring has three wires Ground, White(common) and Black(power or switch leg output). wiring diagram does show the correct connections and I only mentioned it as some might be confused why the original switch used the two black wires and no white but still worked. Also a note, the input 110v source goes on the connection on the same end as the White or common, the light goes on the terminal labeled z-wave and is shown going to light in the diagram.

I use it for the front porch light and the SmartThings hub to control the light at sunrise/sunset and other activity that I want to set. I got tired of coming home after dark to realize I forgot to turn on the porch light, and I wanted to save energy as well. Pairs well with ST hub and is almost 100% when ST service is working correctly. Installation is a little bit daunting at first but don't be afraid to get your hands in the outlet box - once you ensure the breaker is off! (You have to mention this nowadays). This outlet is deeper than your standard light switch so it may take some cramming or reorganizing the cables in the outlet box to make it fit. A big thing to ensure while you are done wiring it up and screwing it in. Because this switch stays in the middle (neutral) position, it is hard to tell which way is up. So visually check the front plate of the switch, it will indicate which direction is UP. This will save you the time unscrewing, flipping, and repacking the outlet box.

All work great so far with the Wink hub simple to pair and speed works for fan and all other switches are working great in a schedule.

Only game in town for toggle-style Z-Wave switches,5.0 ,"As a toggle switch, I think this is the only Z-Wave such switch around. It extends slightly further than a normal toggle switch, and of course returns to the middle position after actuation. You move it up or down to turn it on or off, and then the switch returns to the center position. Works very nicely. Easily included with HomeSeer, for instance. This is my first non-Decora-style Z-Wave switch. I didn't get a Decora for where this went because I didn't feel like buying a new wallplate.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

The manuals provided wiring diagrams for single, three-way and four-way control along with explanations about how to edit settings for the LED light and toggle switches based on whether you mounted it upside down or not. Pairing to the Z-Wave controller or bridge is as easy as putting your bridge into pairing or discovery mode and tapping the up or down button on the switch.

Hook up is simple if you are comfortable or knowledgable with electrical wiring. Integrating it to the smart hub was simple and now I can control my lights from my phone or even through voice command with my amazon echo. These would get a 5 star but they are a bit pricey.

Vt,5.0 ,"I'll preface this review with ""you need to be electrically literate and experienced"" to start out with. These work great, but you must understand how different they are from normal switches you find in your home. The neutral is NOT OPTIONAL. how else would the radio frequency control work if it couldn't draw power? The blue LED status light tells me if the light is on or off from across the room. The color is a dead match for the Simon XT panel. No small wonder, it's all GE stuff. Bottom of the switch is where the neutral and hot wires go. Mess this up and you're toast. The top terminal goes to the light. On a regular switch it would not matter which wire went where as long as the switch breaks the circuit it's good. For a 3-way switch circuit you must buy the compatible slave switch. So open up your wall plates and see if your wiring will support these requirements. These take up all the room in the box so you'll want to make sure there's at least as much room as a GFCI would occupy if not a little more. These are easy to link to the Simon XT panel. No issues there. If you get one installed you'll soon want another and another.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

It works flawlessly 100% of the time when I turn it on/off with the app or with my Amazon Echo. Installation was super simple. NOTE that this does require a neutral wire be available at the switch, so if your switch is installed with only one wire (black and white wires both functioning as black), this won't work and you'll need to run a new wire.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

The problem i had is that these have wires coming out of the back, not your typical poles you can just connect existing wires to. this caused issues with me. in the bedroom we ran a 1500 watt heater some nights in the winter. these wires could not hanlde the power because the current ran through this to get to the wall outlet. the outlet failed and it took me a while to find the issue.

No Nonsense Switch.,4.0 ,"Want a Z-Wave on/off switch. Get this.. No hassle, no drama.. You dont need to do a Masters in any subject to install this switch. Its pretty easy, and works out of the box. Cheap compared to Leviton which is almost double the price. Would give it 5 stars if the prices came down to 25 bucks a pop. Zwave is an inexpensive transmitter inside the switch.. hence the manufacturing vs profit costs is still pretty good for the company if they plan to target a larger market in the future. Zwave is the technology to stay and more people will accept it eventually if more switches like these become price per pocket. At this cost even if you have to install 10 switches in your house you will still hit around 450-500 bucks per install. at 25 dollars price point its still manageable.. comparing to the benifits that the home automation brings.

Amazon sells returned/used/altered item as new. JASCO customer support is horrible.,2.0 ,"When I opened the delivered product, I found one side of the flanges had been snipped off, indicating that the it was a returned item form a previous sale and ALTERED by the previous buyer. But I decided to accept it because I thought it would not practically hurt my use and installation of the item. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered the switch would not respond to Z-Wave communication. I guessed it was because the previous buyer had set it up for his/her network, but I didn't know how to reset the switch to the factory default. I contacted customer support of JASCO, the manufacturer making the switch under GE brand. A few days later I received an email from JASCO saying ""Due to the nature of this device and the steps necessary to troubleshoot any issues it could be encountering, it is necessary to contact our technical support line via phone."" contrary to my expectation that it would be as easy as a few lines of operation instructions. Since ""troubleshooting"" usually requires my presence next to the product, I had to stay home and call JASCO early in the morning. The JASCO customer support answered me with very thick accent over very poor phone connection so that it was hard for me to understand his explanations. But I soon learned that he was not willing to help me at all because, although I believed it was just to put the switch to the factory default state, he insisted that my SmartThings network take care of this and that he have no knowledge on SmartThings. After a few minutes of this useless and disappointing conversation with JASCO customer support, I decided to return the product to Amazon for replacement. A few days after (it was actually really quick!), I received a replacement and it worked fine in seconds! I recently had another similar incident of delivery of a returned/altered Z-Wave product from Amazon, but the product's customer support did a good job to fix the problem very quickly.

I put together a rig to have the switch next to my controller to associate them and then install it where I needed it. Read the instructions carefully. Set up a rig and test. A normal light switch only uses the hot line (black); you will need to provide neutral (white), this was not hard. There is usually a white bundle in the outlet box, just added a white jumper to the switch. Neutral is required as the switch itself will need power to operate and communicate with the controller.

Be aware though that when used in conjunction with the GE Z-Wave Plus Smart Switch Dimmer, there is no ""blue"" indicator light on the add-on switch. The blue indicator light on the primary dimmer switch illuminates whenever the light is off (easier to find in the dark and distinguish when the light is completely off versus a low dimmer setting). The wires are easy to attach though one of the neutral wires popped out (presumably due to lack of tension when i tightened the screw) while installing.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works great with VeraLite,5.0 ,"I have about a dozen of these installed now, and I have to say I'm very happy with them. I have a VeraLite installed and use them to trigger scenes as well as remote control of lighting. For example, when the switch at the top of my basement stairs is turned on, all the lights in the basement turn on. We also have two back doors, and when I turn on one light, both turn on (and off). Installation can be a pain if the box is small, you're installing next to another large item (like another one of these switches, or a dimmer), you have 12 gauge wire, or your boxes aren't wired with neutrals in them. My house was built in 1987 and the wiring hasn't been a problem, but if you don't have a neutral, you'll have to run one. I have installed one without a ground and it's fine, probably since ground and neutral are bridged in most residential installations. The wire connectors are similar to GFCI where they are inserted and then screwed down. I'm not an electrician but do all my own work inside my house, and these are no different or more difficult than installing a GFCI or electronic dimmer. Also, make sure to run a repair on the z-wave network after installing them. This allows them to discover each other and use the repeater capability. Your controller (VeraLite, thermostat, whatever you use to turn them on and off) should have instructions on how to do this.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Not good for automation.,3.0 ,"I bought these switches along with the three-way switch to automate the lights in a work room. My intention was to turn off work lights when path lights were turned off. I have a scene controller to connect the two. These switches won't work for this application because they do not send status (switched on/off) to the controller if you hold the paddle too long. If you just tap the switch, it sends the status, but if you hold the switch it does not. In addition, if you control the lights from the three-way switch, it never sends status. I am confident that my controller is working because I can get the intended operation if I am careful to tap the switch just right. The JASCO In-wall Wirless Smart Switch 45709 is identical to this GE switch and works just as poorly. Edited: Mar. 7, 2016. Changed from 1 star to 3. After examination with a spectrum analyzer, this switch DOES send status regardless of how long the paddle is held; just DIFFERENT status if the paddle is held longer. I was using Universal-Devices ISY 994i ZW PRO as a diagnostic tool which misled me as to the operation of this switch. I can confirm that this switch does not work well with the UDI ISY 994i.

Home automation requires electrical wiring skills,5.0 ,"This switch works well with my Wink Hub and the Amazon Echo. It was easy to install, replacing the standard existing switch. It does require a common wire connection using wire nuts. This switch is deeper than an ordinary switch so it could be a problem with a shallow electrical box found in some homes. You need to know how to use a screwdriver and be sure to turn off power at the breaker before attempting the install. I recommend watching a YouTube video demonstrating the procedure. Safety first.

Great if you have neutral wire.,4.0 ,"Had to return because I had no neutral wire in my older home. Otherwise, would have been a good idea and easy installation.

Z-wave Rocks!,5.0 ,I love the z-wave products and have been slowly automating my entire house. I installed this switch on my garage lights so that I don't have to go out and make sure they are turned off every night. I can check my app from my bed and turn them off if they get left on. I also have them set to turn off automatically at 11pm if on just in case I forget to check.

Great product for being able to control lighting remotely via a Z-wave system,5.0 ,"I recently removed the light fixture kit on the ceiling fan in my bedroom, making it necessary to use lamps off of a switched receptacle in the room. I use Nexia as a home automation product, and wanted to be able to turn the switch on/off from in bed. This switch fits the bill. Instructions were easy, although I have an electrical background. The hardest part was adding it to the Z-Wave system in my house. I had to temporarily bring the bridge closer to the light switch to get it programmed, but after that, I put it back in it's normal spot and it's been working great ever since.

Nice Z-Wave Decora switch and works with ADT pulse.,5.0 ,"works great with ADT pulse. Simple to install and easy to interface. I've had four of these installed for 6 months now without any problems. It is great that you can use this like a regular light switch and still have the Z-wave controller turn the lights on and off per your schedule. The blue LED is a great touch, showing the status of the switch. That being said, if you are contemplating using this switch to turn on a 1-bulb light fixture, you might want to consider a z-wave bulb which is much simpler to install and does the job and also is dimmable.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
It actually worked right on the first try!,5.0 ,"I am not much of a ""do it yourselfer"", but I thought I would give this a try. I was nervous about it, so I read the instructions and watched the video. First, I had to find the right circuit breaker, because I never labeled them. After that, the biggest problem was the size of the unit. I had to pry off the side tabs so that it would fit in a double gang box. With all of the wires, it was a tight squeeze. I pushed everything in and flipped the circuit breaker. Much to my surprise (and my wife's surprise), it worked the first time! I then paired it with my home controller, and I am really pleased that it works. So, I am going to buy more of these, but I won't be buying them on Amazon.

Does what it should; easy to install.,5.0 ,"This ON/OFF switch does just what is expected - turns lights on and off. If you have installed a light switch or dimmer before, this will be the same experience - very simple. This switch works perfectly with ADT Pulse systems and the GE advanced remote control. With the GE remote, you can program a number of features. For example you can program how the blue status LED works. Since this status LED is fairly bright, in some applications some of you may want to program it so the LED is always off. I have left it with its default setting of status LED light wihen light is OFF so I can easily locate the switch in a dark room.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Pros: Easy to install, like any other switch, can be used in 3-way configuration. Works with LED lightning Cons: Requires a hot and neutral connection - these are not always available.

It works as designed and easy to install if you have a basic knowledge of electrical DIY and or if just follow the provided directions. Connecting to my Wink Hub was a bit tricky. The following should make if easier. 1. After installation the switch, move your hub to same room as your z-wave switch. You're going to need a good signal to make the connection. 2. The GE Z-wave wireless lighting switch was not in my Wink Hub app product list, so just bypass their instructions here. 3. Access your Wink Hub app, go to your Hub settings.

The switch is a momentary switch (that means when you press it, it doesn't stay in an up or down/on off position) - which actually is great because it functions as a normal switch and the software you use for your controller knows the state it's in at all times. This is one problems with individual wifi bulbs. If you have set of several lights controlled by 1 switch, this is the way to go, unless you want to have Hue lights or something - then it'd be another situation. Overall, I am highly satisfied.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Fantastic Switch, Will buy again!",5.0 ,"These switches are fantastic when coupled with Amazon's Alexa, or Google's Android assistant. Easy to install, but be sure you have deep boxes. Each switch will require access to the natural run and that uses space fast, especially if you're using 12 gauge wire. :| Not a problem with this switch, that has to do with all smart switches.

Does what it says,4.0 ,"Purchased 3 of these switches to interface with my Vivint Home Security System. Vivint's central panel has a built-in Z-wave controller. Now I can automatically turn on (or off) certain lights as I arm or disarm the system. I can even control how long the lights stay on. For example; Whenever I disarm the system, my front exterior lights turn on as well as some interior lights. As stated in other reviews, this switch requires 4 wires. A load, line, ground and a neutral. In modern homes, more often than not the neutral wires will be passing through the box the switch is in. Looks for a bunch of white wires that are tied together with a wire nut. Remove the wirenut and add a pigtail to the bunch. This will be you neutral for your switch. Replace the wirenut. You may have to go with a larger size nut. Older homes may not be compatible. Generally, if your house has three prong receptacles, you should be OK. The weak point of the switches are the terminals. They can be easily stripped out. Some people feel more comfortable wrapping the wire around the terminals rather than using the clamping system. These are not like the spring clips you find on standard switches. You must insure that the wire is on the correct side of the clamping nut when you tighten down the screws otherwise the wire will fall back out.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

TLDR: Buy GE instead of Linear,5.0 ,"My only complaint is that the tabs that you are supposed to break off do not come off easily. I tried various pliers and cutters, and ended up just using my dremel to make the ""pre-cut"" cut deeper so that I could use pliers. Depending on how good/drunk you are with a dremel this can be a quick task or a longer one. Anyways I was installing quite a few of these so once I had my system down it was pretty easy, but you just need to make sure you plan ahead and know where each switch will be and take off the edges BEFORE you install them. If you're comparing these to the Linears, those tabs come off really easy with pliers. So for the actual switch, I will be comparing the GE 12722 + 12723 combo directly with the Linear WS15Z-1 + WT00Z-1 combo. Quick bit of knowledge: I am not an electrician so some of this is probably obvious and possibly incorrect. A 3-way setup involves two switches with a traveler going between the two. A 4-way setup involves 3 (or more) switches, with the ""4-way"" terminology being that one switch in the setup has two ins and two outs, this switch is connected to TWO switches instead of just one. So first off is price (and prices being the price as of writing this). The 12722 is $40, the accessory switches (12723) are $20. For Linear the main switch is $29 and the ""accessory switches"" are $34.50. In a 3-way setup GE would cost you $60 and the Linear would cost you $63.50. In a 4-way setup with 3 switches GE would cost you $80 and Linear would cost you $98. I made the mistake of reading the OLD reviews for the GE 45xxx switches which were rated pretty unfavorably, so I initially went with Linear, and now I have a frankenstein combination of GE/Jasco and Linear switches. The Linears will only save you money if you are replacing individual switches that are not in a multi-switch set up. The GEs can do a true 3-way / 4-way / multi-way setup, meaning that if an EMP wipes out your server and your z-wave network dies, you can still turn off the light to your dungeon from the switch on the false wall in the kitchen. The Linears are a virtual multi-switch and do not have the ability to incorporate a traveler wire. The ability to control one light from the other has nothing to do with with the wiring, the control of both devices is dependent on your Z-Wave controller. As far as I know GE doesn't have a native virtual switch, however (at least in Homeseer) I can have the Linear WT00Z control any device on my network, so if I did need to add a remote switch to control my GE lights I could use one of those to do so. Color. The switches in my house were standard white, I believe they were Levitons. No idea if this is just the type of white I had for my switches, but the GEs match perfectly whereas the Linears are a slightly different shade of white. It's not really noticeable, but when you have one Linear between two GEs you can tell if you look at them close enough. LEDs. GE: Blue; Linear: Green. Up to you. Installation. GE hands down wins here. The GE switches use punch in terminals and the Linears require wire nuts. The problem with wire nuts is that it adds more bulk to your gang box, and I probably would have punched a hole in my wall before managing to cram three Linears into a 3-way box. The GEs just use the existing wires, save for a wire nut required for the Neutral, which you should just be able to take off from the existing bundle of neutral wires and add it to them (reusing the wire nut that's already there). As mentioned above, it is way easier to remove the metal tabs from the Linears than it is for the GEs. On that note however, the metal on the Linears is much thinner than that of the GEs. The GEs feel as robust as the mechanical switches I took out of the wall, the Linears feel cheap and the metal can bend if you're not careful. All said and done both products work well but if I was purchasing again I would have just done all GE. The Linears that I bought mostly went into single-gang boxes so that I could use the wall plate they come with in order to have the colors match. I'm hesitant to give much in the way of installation tips as I am far from a professional, but if you're wondering what to do with the original line and load wires in a 3-way set up I was told to tie them together with a wire nut since they're not being used. In a 4-way set up you need find the 4-way device and wire nut the two travelers with a pig tail that will then plug into the accessory switch. Know that there are numerous methods for multi-switch setups, and GE doesn't use any of them, so you need to understand how your set up works in order to incorporate the GEs. I highly recommend getting a non-contact voltage tester, a wire tracer/tone generator, and if you live in a house built more than a few years ago make sure you have neutral wires hidding behind the wall switches so you don't waste your time.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Good design,4.0 ,"I'm just starting to set up a Z-Wave network and this is the first remote switch I purchased, controlling an outdoor porch light. Switches I've bought in the past came with wiring already attached and stripped and ready to install out of the box. This one does not and so installation doesn't go as quickly as it could. Keep in mind this switch continually draws power to operate its electronics and so it requires a neutral wire. Also like a lot of fancy in-wall switches, it takes up a lot of room in your electrical box. I like how there are various options you can configure even for a basic on/off switch like this. You can reverse the operation of the switch, and configure the behavior of the blue indicator LED. One negative point is there is noticeable delay of a quarter of a second or so from the time you push the switch to the time the light turns on or off. It would be nice if it was more immediate so it would feel more like a mechanical switch. I don't know if this is typical of these remote switches or not. Also I wish the manufacturer would document the power draw of the switch while it's in a standby state.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works with ADT Pulse,4.0 ,"I have a ADT Pulse system in my home and wanted to be able to control my flood lights. Bought this and a couple things I noticed: 1) Even though it says you do not have to connect the White wire to the unit, I did and it works fine. 2) Have another pulse unit that is already register/linked to your system close by. It is hard to take a wired switch within 10 feet of the Pulse controller with the switch wired up. 3) After you launch the Add function form the device manager, a short press of the switch up or down should do the trick. The 1st 3 or 4 times I tried to connect, I was pushing down and holding.(DO NOT DO) Just a quick press and it connected. Once I had it connected to my Pulse system it was easy going from there. Set up my times to come on and it worked fine.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Works great once installed, but there are a couple of major concerns.",3.0 ,"Once the switch is installed, it works great with SmartThings + Alexa. I like how it provides space for two wires on each screw. It's responsive, intuitive, no regrets. Here are a couple of major things to look out for, though: 1) There's a major flaw in the design where the switch will play dead if you use the screws from your old wallplate. The screw is too long and will short out the insides, which made me think the switch was defective for a minute. I will have to modify my screws because the manual doesn't state where to get compatible ones. -1 star. 2) There is another switch underneath the toggle which can also turn the light on/off. I don't really know why this is needed, but a normal wallplate interferes with it. I will have to modify my plate. Again, the manual doesn't state where to get a compatible plate. -1 star. 3) The ""guts"" of the switch are HUGE! It's pretty much 80% of the size of my old gang box. I had to get a deeper box to accommodate the switch with the wiring. This cost me a dollar and a lot of effort. This won't hurt the score, because it's not the switch's fault and YMMV.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Great so far... Here's some installation pointers.,5.0 ,"Just installed this, and it works great. Once I figured out the electrical installation details, it was easily setup and working on my Honeywell Lynx 5200. A few pointers for installation to hopefully save you some time. 1. This device requires a neutral (typcially white) wire connection. I used the supplied jumper wire to connect the bundle of neutral wires in the junction box to the connection on the switch. 2. This device must have line and load wires identified and connected correctly. The location of these connections on a typical switch may not be the same as this smart switch. Therefore, you should use a multimeter or voltage detector to identify the line wire (hot when switch is off). 3. Finally, this switch is very deep. It was challenging to fit it in the junction box (3 gang box) with all the other wires and such. The blue LED on the front lights when the switch is not on.

Another great low cost home automation product.,4.0 ,"I have had great success with these switches. They are a fraction of most other home automation switches and I have only had an issue with one out of about twenty. I bought these on/off instead of the dimmer model to control our under counter fluorescent lighting in our kitchen. I thought it was a little crazy to buy a dimmer and dimming ballast for these lights. They are not that bright anyway. In order to dim fluorescent lighting, you must have a ballast that is dimable. A dimmer will not work on a regular ballast. The dimming ballast are quite expensive as well.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Nice switch,5.0 ,"Works great. *** Programming note. To make this visible to your hub, place your hub in discovery mode and then toggle the switch on and off a few times.

Unsure if this works correctly,3.0 ,"I have several zwave devices in my home and this one puzzles me. While it is scheduled to run everyday, the power (light) level appears to be a bit random. One day it will be extremely bright and the next it will be somewhat shaded. I have also found that using a flourescent, energy saving light-bulb renders the light useless. I'm sure this is due to the power differential when using the dimmer function. Finally, I'm tracking down a problem where my thermostats and indoor dimmers are losing connection to the zwave bridge. This just started occurring when I placed this switch into service. More to follow. Overall, I think this may be a good device but I'm probably using it for the wrong application.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works fantastic with ADT pulse system,5.0 ,"This receptacle is compliant with the ADT pulse system. They are very easy to wire, but they do require neutral and ground connections. The top plug is not zwave so you can use this for something that you don't see the need to ever switch it on and off with your pulse system (perfect for a bathroom where you plug in hair dryer, etc). The bottom is zwave and I use it for all kinds of automation from Christmas lights to randomizing lights during vacation. Once you start adding these, you may become obsessed like me and my husband who see this in almost every room of the house.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Word of advice for amateur installers,5.0 ,Works great. One note for amateur installers -- the metal tabs on the sides of the switch are removable to make the switch better fit in existing boxes.

I have the Amazon Echo connected to the SmartThings hub and can control the outlet with voice commands. My only real complaint is the outlet has pigtails of braided wire.

Because I can turn off the blue light,5.0 ,"This switch matches well with conventional decorator switches and can be operated manually in addition to using z-wave for control. The rocker stays in a neutral position and does not click into an on or off position like conventional decorator style switches. The default programming is for the blue LED in the lower right hand corner of the switch to stay on while the device it controls is turned off. The switch includes instructions on how to change this to on when the device is on, or off at all times. The programming of the blue LED is dependent on your z-wave controller.

these switches work great. When working with single switch locations,4.0 ,"Operationally, these switches work great. When working with single switch locations, I have had no problems installing them and using them with my SmartThings hub. However, I recently did my first 2 gang (4"" box) installation and ran into some space issues. These switches are BIG. I was unable to but two side by side in my junction box due to the metal mud ring/cover (Steel City 5/8"" raised). I replaced the cover with a new one (Raco 5/8"" raised) that has a bigger hole, but they still do not fit comfortably next to each other, even with the aluminum tabs on the common side broken off. I was able to work it out so that they are mostly in the box with the wall plate on, but it does not look very well. This is in my garage, so I am not too concerned. I will try it in my house soon with the 1/2"" raised covers and see if I have any better luck. If anyone has suggestions on which covers to use where these fit nicely next to each other, I would appreciate the input! Update: They are still tight in the 1/2"" raised mud ring, but they do fit. I went back and worked some more on the 5/8"" raised installation and was able to clean it up. I am still very happy with how they work and continue to buy more.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

When working with Zwave...,5.0 ,"One thing to note when working with Zwave is its a very weak frequency. What I mean by that is dont listen to the ad's that say you can turn a light on remotely and thats it. Unless your in 300 sqft studio this will not work. When you jump into Zwave plan on going ""all or nothing"" and replacing EVERY switch zwave. Even if its a room that you dont use, change it out anyways. Zwave hardwired devices (light switch's, tstats, etc) act as repeaters to each other and sheetrock walls or any walls for that matter will knock the signal down 10ft per wall and zwave devices have a 30ft radius. If you have room after room of zwave overlapping with hallways, rooms, downstairs/upstairs, etc the overkill will help you in the long run.

Also, the face plate screws included must be used since the ones on my existing switch were too long and thick. The screws provided are white. Not good on my antique bronze face plate.

I think if it is expected that this be a DIY project they should be smaller. So far none of the switches I've installed has been hard to get a neutral wire to. When I get upstairs I will have to get into the attic to rum more wire. These operate with a soft click sound. The sound doesn't bother anyone in my house.

great while it lasted,2.0 ,"Worked great for about 6 months. Now the z-wave functionality has stopped working. It still works fine as a dumb switch, but I can't connect it to my home automation setup anymore, so it defeats the purpose.

I have used a similar product from Lowes Iris System but encountered problems for one reason or another. The switch is solidly built and don't feel cheap in your hands. It appears that it will hold up to the many years of use. The quality of the switch was above my expectation because I have dealt with switches like this in the past that was very poorly built.

Nice Switch,4.0 ,"This is a nice Z-Wave Switch. Installation was straight forward and it setup and paired with my Vera Lite easily. I would recommend this switch to anyone looking for a good Z-Wave switch. The only drawback and the reason for only 4 stars is that a neutral wire is required. It is stated in the description and I knew when ordering it was needed, but if they would/could make a switch with no neutral required that would be a winner as a lot of older homes don't have them nor can they be easily retrofit to have a neutral.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

DOES NOT HAVE INSTANT STATUS REPORTING BE CAREFUL,2.0 ,"If you want to control a scene with this then LOOK OUT. It's great for certain applications. But....it does not have instant status reporting capabilities. This means that the controller has to poll the device periodically (every 60 seconds) to see the status. Which means that if you are controlling a scene, you flip the switch and have to wait up to a minute for the devices being controlled to respond. I tried all kinds of things including writing code to force it to poll more often. It''s complicated but you can get it to respond a little more quickly that way but it's still not great. Increasing the polling interval too much locks the thing up. See below for my alternative that worked great. Also, the switch just doesn't ""feel right"". It's not a true toggle switch and doesn't ""flip"". Instead it sort of pushes up or down a little and then returns to the center. If you want your switches to feel like traditional wall switches this one is the closest I've seen. But still not there. This solution fixes both problems: I bought the Aeon Labs DSC26103-ZWUS micro controller instead. It's a small device that you install right behind your traditional wall switch inside the box. Since you are still using your original wall switch it feels right. Plus this device can be set to do instant status reporting. By setting that (Variable 80, set it to 1), the main controller will get the status immediately and there is almost no delay when controlling scenes or remote devices.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Wiring Simplicity,5.0 ,"The great thing about these switches is there are 2 connections for hot & neutral each. This means if you have to put two of them next to each other you can simply gang them together. It cuts down greatly on the number of wires you have to stuff into the back of the switch box. Even if putting a single switch into a box with a normal switch you can power the normal switch from this switch. Of course, with an on/off switch you have to live with the relay clicking on & off, but it's not so bad. Z-Wave connectivity was easy and works well, this is the simplest form of a Z-Wave device.

Good Value - Weak Documentation,4.0 ,"So I'm not an electrician by any means but I thought the documentation was a bit lacking. The difficulty I had getting this going was related to the fact that the old switch didn't utilize the neutral wire, whereas this requires it. Not a big deal, but it left me scratching my head. Once the neutral wire was connected everything worked just fine. There was a little issue connecting one of them to Vera, but after a Vera reset it worked just fine. The product feels cheaply made. I would have given this 3 starts if it weren't for the price. But at <$50, I think it was a pretty darn good value. If I wanted super high quality, I could have paid twice as much and bought a Leviton switch. I will likely buy several more of these for switches where I don't need immediate status feedback to Vera.

"Works fine, but some flaws.",3.0 ,"This is a great device. The quality seems very good. Installation is very quick and easy, just like swapping out an outlet. There are a couple things you should know though. First is that this only has a single connection, meaning you will lose functionality if you replace an outlet that is also switch. (Some outlets have the bottom outlet always on and the top outlet is operated with a wall switch.) This isn't a flaw and it isn't implied anywhere that it would work for that application, but I wish I would have realized that before I installed it. I didn't lower my rating because of that. Installation is easy, but functionality is not. The directions are essentially ""install it, the turn on your z wave device and pair it."" There is no directions to indicate how to put the device in pairing mode. Also, I have a Vivint system and they need a serial number, which isn't available when it is installed. Additionally, the instructions say that in some installations initial set up must be done within ten feet of the controller--a big flaw for an outlet that could go anywhere in your house. Mine luckily was within that distance so I didn't get the chance to test the ten foot distance issue. Once I got it set up with Vivint it works flawlessly, and looks great. My biggest complaint is the blue light that cant shut itself off. It is always on when the z-wave enabled signal has shut the power off. So either the outlet is ""on"" and the blue light is off or the outlet is ""off"" and the blue light is on. More and more devices are doing this, which is not needed and adds no functionality. Granted, a small LED doesn't use much power but it is ironic that a device that is marketed as a way to conserve electricity has a light that you can't shut off. And it is definitely bright enough that in a bedroom it would be very bothersome. Had I known that ahead of time I would not have bought this and will not but another. Edit to add faceplate information: It is true there is no faceplate, because there is no way to know which faceplate to include in the package. This could be installed as a single outlet, in a double outlet, etc, or a single outlet and a cable outlet...the possibilities are endless so it doesn't make sense to include an outlet cover. No other outlets come with covers for this same reason. However, that isn't really common knowledge and most people assume that the outlet and the cover are the same product, like a bottle and a lid. So while GE doesn't imply this comes with a faceplate, and I don't think they are under any obligation to say that this doesn't come with a faceplate because that is the industry standard, it would make people happier with the product because they wouldn't be expecting a faceplate and then have to run to the local hardware store and buy a faceplate...the faceplate from the old outlet almost certainly won't work.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Good controllers,3.0 ,"These are good controller for zwave but not great. I find the buttons slightly difficult to operate compared to some other devices. They require a much more deliberate press than a standard switch. The other issue is they do not have a ""check back"" feature with the zwave network meaning that if they send a signal to the network and somehow that signal is lost, the device does not know to resend the signal. This may seem minor but causes many problems in a zwave system.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Awesome but quirky install,5.0 ,"I have about 25 of these switches and they all work flawlessly. I should warn you to be patient with these after you install them.

All of the z-wave appliances in your home go through routing trial and error until they perfect the communication between themselves. By 3-4 days after installation, they are rock solid.

Great Z-Wave device for home automation,5.0 ,Great Z-Wave device for home automation. GE/Jasco have built a really good quality switch.

These are well made and easy to install,5.0 ,"These are well made and easy to install. It is a little hinky, connecting them to a Wink Hub (you need to specify generic Z-Wave light), but that really isn't a criticism of the switch (more of Wink's limited device list, but it works great once connected).

Nice option for SmartThings,5.0 ,"I replaced GE Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Dimmer Switch with the ON/OFF version. I did not like the dimmer version as much since it goes from dim to full brightness in a second or two when turning on and from full brightness to dim when turning off. This switch is instant on or instant off from either the SmartThings app or the wall switches. I used this in a four way setup (three wall switches and the lights). I have a review in the dimmer switch reviews about installation if interested and some more information below. I would purchase again for this application. DETAILS: As I have been implementing my home automation set up, I am faced with a few fundamental choices. One option are smart bulbs that communication with your automation system Quirky Bulb PSB30-SW27 65W Equivalent BR30 Connected LED Light Bulb, Soft White , Philips 432278 Hue Personal Wireless Lighting, BR30 Starter Pack, 3-Pack , and LIFX Edison Screw WiFi Enabled Multicolor Dimmable LED Light Bulb, Pearl White for me) which can provide light-by-light automation through SmartThings or the manufacturers apps. The other option is to automate the wall switches and use ""dumb"" bulbs in the sockets, but then individual light control is not possible. Either option can be linked to motion sensors, programmed scenes, etc. The biggest difference is can you control each light, or just the bank of lights controlled by the switch. In my applications I have used both methods. For my kitchen lights, there are six light bulbs all controlled by wall switches. There are other lights in the area for accent lighting that I use smart bulbs to dim and provide mood lighting. I installed the dimmer master switch referenced above and two auxiliary switches ( GE 45610WB Z-Wave Add On Auxiliary Switch ). The dimmer master switch worked fine, but it limited the bulbs I could use (must be dimmable bulbs or the lights will pulse on/off and never turn on) and I did not like the soft start when using the wall switches. I swapped out the master for this switch and kept the same auxiliary switches. Initially wiring up the dimmer master and auxiliary switches was difficult. I put some info in my review of GE Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Three-Way Dimmer Kit . Swapping out the dimmer master for the on/off master was easy. I did not have to open the auxiliary switch boxes. I just removed the dimmer master and installed the on/off master in its place. The dimmer switch did not require a connection to the neutral wiring, but this switch does. I added the appropriate wire and it worked fine. Set up was easy with SmartThings. It detected the switch right away and setup was as easy as any other device in SmartThings (so not good, not bad).","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Works great, but the ground screw broke right off",4.0 ,"Works great, but the ground screw broke right off! We made it work. With two side-by-side it's tough to make them fit, but we made that work too. Be very careful with the screws that hold wires in. Also do not mix up load with supply wire, and connect all wires!

Painless with VeraLite,5.0 ,"Device pairing with Mi Casa Verde VeraLite was quick and painless. Easily integrated with an existing scene, and was controlling with an Android phone in a few minutes. One thing to note regarding the install: This is a powered device, and as such will require a neutral in the box. This is very easy to check - pull the plastic cover off the existing switch box and have a look. If there is only 1 cable consisting of 2 (or 3) wires and all of them are directly connected to the switch - you don't have a neutral, contact someone qualified.

Work Great! I have them set up with a Samsung ...,5.0 ,"Work Great! I have them set up with a Samsung SmartThings Hub and a Google Home, and I'm having a blast! Took me a while to figure out how to install them, this was my first time working with a light switch box and I spent the whole time worried I was about to kill myself (I kept checking the electrical panel to make sure the circuit was off) but boy was it satisfying when I finished! I like that they go back to neutral position after a satisfying click when you press them manually. I was worried about two fitting in one switch box, but luckily they have removable tabs on the sides, and they fit fine once removed. Some key learnings: 1) This model won't work until all four wires are connected (Ground, Neutral, Lead, Line) 2) If you've set them up properly, by default they are ""off"", and the blue LED is on. When you turn the light ""on"", the Blue LED turns off. 3) My home's wiring used the same color of wire for both the lead and line, and unfortunately I mixed them up on my first attempt. I'm probably super lucky that I didn't blow something up, but the GE switch did not turn on in this configuration. It did start working properly after I swapped the wires, and it seems that i did no permanent damage","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Great switches!,5.0 ,"These switches work flawlessly! My house was built in 2008, and the neutrals were in the junction box pulled together and connected to a wire connector. I bought about 10 feet of 14 gauge of insulated solid copper wire from Home Depot and cut them to ~6"" in length. I then connected one end to the neutral connector on the switch, and ran the other end to the junction of neutrals at the wire connector. Works great! I like the blue LEDs. I think the brightness is just right, not too bright. Also had no problems connecting to my MiCasa Vera2. It connected by putting the Vera2 in Z-Wave listen mode, pushing up on the switch, waiting for the Vera2 to blink rapidly, then pushing down on the switch, and waiting for the Vera2 to blink rapidly. For whatever reason, if I only did one or the other and ended the session, it wouldn't be recognized as a new device in the Vera2. My only complaint about the switch is removing the 3 ears on each side of the switch to make it fit in a multi-switch box. It's a huge pain. I'm worried about flexing the switch too much while twisting the ears back and forth to get them off. So far, so good though.

Easy to Install with some online learning,5.0 ,"These devices are easy to install once you education yourself. These Devices require a neutral wire (mine were white), however they were in the back of my back of my box behind the existing switch with a wire nut on it. I simply bought some romex wire and cut a 6 inch piece and connect it to the white that was in the wire nut and the other to my zwave switch and eveything worked.

I like them.,3.0 ,"I like them.. when they work. Occasionally you will get one that doesn't like to stay connected to the central security system. Its a Z-wave issue of some kind.

Whats not to like about automated lighting?,5.0 ,"I bought one of these to test with my Smartthings Hub v2 in our secondary home and I wanted to make sure it works before spending a lot of $ on light switches. This switch was as easy to install as a normal light switch. Syncing to the ST hub was easy as well and it functions flawlessly. I have this set up to run on a schedule when the family is not home to give the perception that the home is occupied. I will be buying more of these, along with motion sensors, to install throughout the house for a fully automated lighting solution.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
takes persistence to program,4.0 ,"If it weren't for the fact that I had to hit this on/off button 20x times to get the remote controllers to catch its signal, I'd give it a 5-star. When installing, ensure that you know and verify which wires are hot, cold, and load to make it work. Make sure your wire is between the metal plates as you tighten the nuts to ""grab"" the wire, else your wire will come loose. There is a micro-second ""lag"" between hitting this switch and your lights going on/off. Works great with the other Jasco remote switch and my cheap WayneDalton $15 remote, after everything is programmed. I've already ordered 2 more of these switches after seeing that they work so well.

Have installed 5 of these in house - all work as described,5.0 ,"A few of these replaced the Intermatic z wave light switch, which seemed to have issues with the toggle. After a period of time, with the Intermatic, the switch stopped working (probably just a spring). I have not had that problem with these GE switches. The one annoying thing is that they are all set, by default, to ""all on all off"" command, meaning you have to take steps if you don't want the switch to turn off an on when you send an ""all"" command.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

simple,4.0 ,"I love the idea for this product and I will use it to control my Xmas lights. I bought to help control a space heater but the zwave outlet will only control 600 watts, the non zwave will control 1200. I figure down the road they will make one to control higher watt pulling devices. Easy to install, you twist 3wires and u r done.

A perfect addition to any Z Wave network,5.0 ,"I added 6 of these switches to my network for controlling simple on/off of multiple lights around my house. One of the best applications is at my front porch. I have it set to turn on just before arriving home and turn back off about 30 minutes later.

I'd recommend this product to anyone! I'm running MControl V 2.1 on a HP MediaSmart EX470 running Windows Home Server V1.

GE 45605 Z-Wave module installed JUST IN TIME,5.0 ,"We were committed to replacing several old analog timers controlling table lamps and security lighting around our home. We experience 1-2 power outages each month. Most outages are less than an hour or two, but each outage requires us to reset each of the timers. Our home security system uses a Honeywell 6280i Tuxedo Touch Z-Wave keypad. This model also supports Z-Wave so we're using it as our Z-Wave controller. We started replacing the analog timers last night. Installation took about five minutes for each GE 45605 module. If you do not have a copper ground wire or grounded box, this module may not work. Verify this BEFORE opening the sealed GE 45605 package, so you have an option to return the product. Once installed, we pressed the activation button on each of the modules. The modules immediately displayed on our keypad controller. The blue LED light on the module should now be on also indicating it linked to the controller. We created Z-Wave Scenes and programmed the on/off times for each module on the keypad and they worked perfectly. We woke up this morning to yet another power outage. Just by habit family members began to reset the old analog timers. The problem was those old timers were gone. Since our keypad controller receives current time (including Daylight Savings Time) from our security system, no adjustments are required. We will never need to reset timers again. Remember, only the bottom outlet on this module is Z-Wave enabled. The top outlet power is always hot (live). We also installed a Honeywell Z-Wave Thermostat module and also use our keypad to make changes to our HVAC system. With this keypad controller also hardwired to our home network, we can control all Z-Wave modules via any web-enabled device including iPhones, iPads, and PC's.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Good Z-Wave Light Switch,4.0 ,"This product works well with my Z-Wave system. Documentation included was easy to read an follow. Be prepared, the device's control box will take most of the depth of a standard electrical switch box. My box had four switches and a large number of neutral wires inside of it so I had to move them a bit to make sure the switch sited inside properly. The other issue was the way my previous switch was wires. Like I mentioned all the neutrals were ganged into one connector so the switch I was replacing did not have a neutral wire. So I had to pay an electrician to install it. Not the product's fault but due to my individual circumstances. If installed properly (the switch does have an arrow to indicate which side is up). The switch was an led light at the bottom which will light up. The led turns off when the light is turned on and lights up when the switch is turned off. This nay be reversed if the switch is connected to a controlling system like the My Casa Verde controllers. While the switch looks like a rocker switch it really does not ""rock"" when you press the top portion it turns off and when you press the potton portion it turns off. Its more like clicking a mouse button. So this feedback takes a little getting used to. The LED light serves as a positive confirmation of the status of the switch specially useful if switch is turning lights on and off what are not visible from the switch location. In my case the switch controls flood lights outside my house which I don't get to see if that are on of off from the switch location. My only objection to the switch is that the side ""break-away tabs"" do not break-away very easily. As a matter of fact I was unable to break them off, so I had to squeeze the switch between two switches leaving no room between them. SInce the switch fitted even with the tabs on I am still giving it good marks. I hope durability is good. Botton line, switch works as designed, price is reasonable, comes with good documentation and is relatively easy to install. The switch depth while not excessive is considerable and the breakaways tabs don't. So it gets four stars from me.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

I will spend more time tomorrow trying to get my Wink hub to see this device. If not, I'm sending it back. (The GE box says it works with Wink. When I scan the bar code from the wink app, it says not supported - add manually. Why???) So, the pairing part could be Wink or the GE switch. I don't know yet. The bad URLs are GE. Update: I was able to pair with my Wink. I had to unplug my Wink and reset it. Sigh - the Wink is still a little twitchy but I'm liking the hub all the same. Adding it is kind of add. Even though this is a power plug, you have to go to lights to add it (for Wink). Ok - kind of confusing. You just pick ZWave switch. Maybe Wink should add a new category?

Easy way to automate lighting,5.0 ,"I've been automating the lighting in my home for the past year. At first I purchased smart light bulbs for every light and lamp. Eventually I discovered this product and realized that for things like chandeliers with 5 or more light bulbs, kitchen lights with bulbs that are non standard, the only smart way to automate them is with this switch. Now that we've installed it in our kitchen light switch, I can't imagine how we lived without it. Much cheaper/better way to automate lighting. Installation was a breeze, it easily integrated with my existing Samsung Smart Hub and was controllable along with my other devices via voice commands through Amazon Alexa. I plan to purchase more of these switches in the future since its a much better way to control certain lights without having to purchase all those expensive light bulbs.

Works with ADT Pulse,4.0 ,I separately purchased and installed two of these units in my house in July 2013. Cannot complain how fast they shipped under my Prime Account. I received both of them sooner than the 2-day guarantee. Before I purchased them I verified that I had a neutral wire in my electrical outlet box. I have an ADT Pulse system. They were easy to install and easy to link through the ADT Pulse interface. Yes – they do take up more space in your electrical outlet box but it is manageable. Yes- they do have a little blue LED light at the bottom that lights up when the unit is off. But I like that because in the dark you can easily find the switch. Please note that “Jasco” markets and distributes GE branded products.

"Great lights, but read closely!",4.0 ,"This is a great product, but depending on your needs you should be aware of a few things. The footprint for this dimmer is large, and I mean slightly larger than any of the other paddle GE, Jasco, Levitron, etc dimmers and switches I have. What did this mean?- Well, I had to shave the wall box slightly to make room for the ground screw. Also, this will not sit properly next to a Belki WEMO switch in a two or three gang box. I don't think two of these would fit next to each other either. I used it in a three gang and I had to put the smart switches on the side locations to make room. Basically the three extenders on the side will push a WEMO in such a way that the cover plate won't fit properly or if it does go on the switches are clearly out of alignment. The last thing is the toggle switch. It is a little pointy and I can see why some people complain. The good: it works just like I planned. Even if you don't have a smart home/hub, this is a great dimmer for low watt LED lights. Be sure you have a White Nuetral wire and you won't have problems with humming or flickering. I can't find reliable dimmers that don't have ZWave or Zigbee technology included, but I need them for my smartthings hub anyway. We have a very expensive entry way light (Pottery Barn or Restoration Hardware), BUT the stupid thing would only take three 25 watt candle E12 lights (way, way too dim). Now with the more reliable LED light, I can put in three 6w bulbs and the light is super bright. If you take this route, I recommend a dimmer and dimmable bulbs - I use CRLights brand. I recommend the CRLights, 6W 2700K warm color. I've used the 3200k soft white equivilant from this brand and they are very bright. I'd rather use warm light of a higher watt on a dimmer. It produces a great effect when dimmed, but I can crank it I need. Be aware on lights that the LED brands are not all equivilant on the brightness rating (one brands 3200k looks like another's 4000k). I hope this review helps you with your purchase.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Very nice when the curling iron gets left on...,5.0 ,"I put one of these in my bathroom so that I could turn my wife's hair accessories off for those occasions when we're halfway to church and she realizes she forgot to unplug said appliance. We used to have to turn around and go back, but now I just pull over or wait till we get there, pull up the app on my phone and turn it off, no problem honey! Really a great thing to be able to do, haven't had any problems with it, and one other thing, the little blue LED that shines when the outlet is turned off is super handy when all the lights are off.

Stay Away - Cheap Dimmer,2.0 ,"OK zwave dimmer. 1 of 4 didn't include in the network correctly. This caused me to have to exclude and disconnect lots of devices to solve. This same thing happened with 1 of the GE/Jasco decora dimmers. I don't like that you can't double-tap up on the toggle for full brightness. Given that you have to hold the switch to dim, and on returns to the previous dim level, a double-tap up for full brightness would be very useful as on some Lutron dimmers. Finally, and perhaps my biggest complaint given that the rest is overcome once you've setup or gotten used to it... When you set the dim level via zwave, the device doesn't dim to the level. It just jumps to that brightness level instantly. It's an electronically controlled dimmer. There is NO EXCUSE for this behavior. It dims smoothly when turned on and off. It dims smoothly between brightness levels when controlled from the dimmer switch itself. But if you want to go from 80% to 50% via zwave, that's instantaneous. GE did themselves a disservice letting Jasco license their name and produce these things under it.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Ditto What Others Have Said,4.0 ,"I installed two of these switches in the same box over this past weekend, and will echo most of what has been said previously, with a couple of warnings (which is why it's only 4 stars). 1. With the little metal tabs on either side of the switch, it is TIGHT. Further, it was basically impossible for me to break them off. I hesitated resorting to a hack saw, so left the tabs in place. Hence, why it was such a tight fit in the box. 2. A neutral wire is a MUST. Lucky, I had neutral wires bundled in the box that were unused. However, simply taking one of those and plugging it into the neutral location was NOT effective. I needed to purchase another length of wire (all of 3-5 inches), and join THAT to the already existing neutral wire bundle in the box, and connect the NEW wire to the switch. Basically, kep the neutral wires bundled and run a wire off of them for the switches. 3. I used the push-in wire locations (rather than wrapping the wire around the posts). This was easy and the posts tightened down to clamp the wires in place -- except for one neutral. It just would not budge! I actually exchanged it and the new one worked just fine. 4. Did I mention putting two together in a box is TIGHT?! 5. Once these were in place, they each paired with my Vera3 in about 10 seconds. No fuss, no muss, no hassle. I had them set in automated scenes within a couple of minutes and working perfectly. 6. The documentation provided does not cover any of this. The documentation is the one downfall on this product. Rely upon the internet, reviews, and others comments. They are VERY helpful! I would clearly recommend using these switches and plan to add several more to the house in the future, now that I know the ""tricks.""","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

A basic on/off switch you can control with Z-wave,4.0 ,"I have a number of wall switches I wanted to sense and control from my Z-wave (Vera 3) system, and the Jasco seemed like one of the better options. Like most of the other switches of this type, you need a white (neutral) wire running to the box in order to install the switch properly...my understanding is that this is how the internal Z-wave radio is powered. Still, if you don't have the neutral feed in your junction box, it would take some creative wiring (and maybe a professional electrician) to install one of these. If you have any doubts, there are some good YouTube installation videos that help a lot. I was able to pair with my Z-wave controller at a distance of about 30 feet with no trouble - just did a ""full power"" pairing and the device was found with no trouble at all. Once installed, this type of Z-wave switch acts like a range extender to your Z-wave network, so for the price of running an extra transmitter, you get generally better communications every time you install another switch. My only complaint about these switches is that the ""feel"" is a bit cheap. Instead of a nice solid ""thump"" when you switch it on and off, it does feel a bit flimsy. Otherwise, they absolutely work perfectly, were easy to pair with my system and even have a pleasant blue LED to make finding the switch easy in a dark room, or to tell at a glance whether the switch is on or not. Otherwise, these switches function flawlessly and I have no reservations about using them in my home automation system. Definitely recommended.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Works with Alarm.com or Vivint Home security Systems 2GIG-TS1,5.0 ,"I bought this unit and installed it fairly simple. 1. Kill the power to the outlet you use from the breaker panel 2. Confirm power is shut off via a tester or a simple power strip with a light or just a lamp turned on 3. Replace the wall outlet with this one 4. Power back on 5. Test power with a simple power strip with nothing plugged in it and see if the light is red or green etc... NOTE: if your light is half dim you may have the neutral and ground wires mistaken. 6. Once confirmed just link up with Alarm.com System, I happen to have the 2GIG-TS1 ( 2gig ) console for my alarm. 7. Once this is linked up you can login to your app for alarm.com or Vivint and automatically kill the power to say your TV/Receiver/Game systems/ and other non essentials products that you can turn off while you are not home to ensure they don't consume power sitting idle. I plugged mine into a 8 outlet surge protector as only 1 side is controlled by the zwave. With Alarm.com or Vivint you can even schedule a power schedule for this. Also good for grounding kids who want to come home and watch TV and not do their homework. Only con I can think of is that it comes with no wall plate as the one you replace will not just fit over it.

Works great with Samsung Smarthing Hub,5.0 ,"I use two of these in conjunction with my Samsung SmartThings Hub (v2). I did the replacement wiring myself which went well - you just have to follow the directions carefully to make sure you wire in the white neutral wire. I also had the two black hot wires reversed the first time I tried my first switch so look out as it's easy to do that also. No big deal as you just swap the black wires if you get it wrong the first time but worth testing everything before you screw it all back into the outlet box. I also had some challenges getting this to connect to my network for the first time but figured out through trial and error, it was some kind of networking issue with my Hub. Once I deactivated WiFi on my smartphone (and connected to my Hub via cellular) I was able to easily connect the first switch to my Hub. These are nice in that they also act as Z-wave repeaters to effectively extend your range. We have a large house and I have other Z-wave devices in extreme distances outside so these have helped from a Z-wave network range perspective.

"Easy and functional, however the toggle itself looks strange",4.0 ,"I own several GE brand z-wave switches, and overall, I'm happy with this one. It's very simple to hook up with standard screw type connections in the back and even simpler to pair. It takes a standard plate cover, and fits nicely into your normal wall box. The reason I knocked a star off is the look of the switch piece itself. It's shorter and thinner than your average switch, and instead of an up or down flick, it sticks straight out from the body. It has a very short throw, in which it contacts some sort of micro switch inside, and then falls right back to the straight out perpendicular position. If aesthetics are imperative, you may not be completely happy, however I have no complaints about function. I like the switch, and will likely buy more to continue to build out my z-wave based home automation.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Works Well but Size Matters,4.0 ,This item works well and I have had no problems with its' functioning. The problem is it's size. The mechanical enclosure behind the outlet is sizable. This makes a difference in spacing inside the outlet junction box. This may not be a problem for homes that are free standing structures where most of the wiring is run in the ceiling and attic areas but in condos where the outlet junction boxes are sometimes used as splice locations for conductor continuation it could be a problem. Even in your condo not all the outlet boxes will have a large number of wire nuts but some may. I would estimate that the Z-wave outlet back will go an inch inside the box from top to bottom I recommend you confirm the location you have chosen has the space to accommodate this Z-wave outlet. Other wise a fine product that I find does exactly what it says it will do.

"Works perfectly, but be sure you know what's necessary to wire it up or hire an electrician.",5.0 ,"The switch works perfectly. I connected it to my Honeywell Tuxedo within seconds. There are just a few caveats with wiring that everyone should know of ahead of time. As documented in the instructions, this switch requires 4 wires be connected to it (Load/Black, Line/Black, Ground/Green or Copper, Neutral/White). The switch you're replacing may only have 2-3 wires in use (Load/Black, Line/Black, Ground/Green or Copper). Don't assume function by just color - be sure you're using a volt meter or line tester to verify the wires and any voltage. The Neutral wire is required! That will require a new wire be fished through for the neutral connection -- or a new pigtail (piece of wire) ran to the group of neutral wires you may have tucked away in the back of the box. The wire holes in the back work well, but you need to be sure to press the screw down so the wire sits above the connector and then tighten the screw. You should not be able to just pull the wire back out afterwards. I installed this for our front lights and so far so good! I also bought additional units, so I'll update after a few months with any additional info.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Remember White (Neutral) Wire MUST Be Connected,3.0 ,"This product works fine. It took me several repeated installs to finally figure out a key fact - the WHITE neutral wire MUST be connected for this Z-Wave switch to work. The instructions mention this in small print very early on and there is a lot of other distracting information. For a single-pole (1-way) normal wall switch, only the black wire to the load and the hot wire from the breaker panel (line) are connected. The instructions also mislead you by suggesting you wire this switch just like the existing manual switch. The instructions do not mention clearly (or at all) that there is a short white neutral jumper provided to connect from the neutral wires twisted together with a pigtail wire nut to the neutral connector. If you think through that this is an active relay which requires A/C power for the Z-Wave electronics to work, it makes sense but I was trying to follow the instructions exactly. This would be a 4 star product once they fix the instructions.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Installation was a snap & they all paired correctly the first time. We've been using them for the past month or so & they've been reliable - no issues so far.

There is very little room for wire nuts. I put the second one in the garage in a 4"" box. For that one I got a 4"" box extender. It required major surgery to the mounting tabs on the switch and also on the extender. The only reason I got this on was that it is a toggle switch which I needed to fit the cover plates. The toggle sticks straight out and looks a little strange next to conventional switches.

Nice little outlet,4.0 ,"The GE Outlet is a good choice for Z-Wave add-on, for all kinds of devices. We have them running lights, fountain, fan, radio, decorations and others... They work predictably and having had some working for a couple years, we've seen no issues. A couple items that can be considered PLUSs or NEGATIVEs depending on how you see them: - The (very bright) Blue Light on the device glows when the device is OFF - Every time the device kicks in, you hear a little relay CLICK. In general, I consider them both features; some folks I understand think the light is backwards being ON when the outlet's OFF. And some people with home theatre installs find a blue light in a dark room really annoying... And some folks apparently don't like the audible click when going off/on, (like when it wakes the baby turning off lights near the crib).

Does not work with LED low wattage bulbs.,3.0 ,"Well, This review is together with Leviton VRI06-1LZ Vizia RF. I tried both and after many hours of testing and reading and back and forth I finally figured that these will not work with low wattage LED light bulbs. I don't think these are bad products but some how they didn't recognize the current flowing through the bulbs. They are made for regular bulbs, or maybe higher wattage LED bulbs. The bulbs that i used were 2 bulbs each at 3 watts and it failed to recognize them so I assume that the minimum wattage has to be 13 watts( although I never tested that). So since we are all going to use LED soon, I would suggest that the manufactures need to take into consideration how to manage the products that can be compatible with them. I hope it helps and saves some time for other people.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

My home has old knob and tube wire and I could not get them to work at all. Then learned on the smartthings forum that if you don't have a neutral you will need the dimmer version.

Switch works very well,4.0 ,"Completely disagree with the other reviewer. Granted, this could have been more clearly labeled and explained (which is why I'm only giving 4 stars, but it does say ""auxiliary"" in the product title. This switch, sku # 12728, is meant for circuits where you have more than one switch. Example: a foyer light that has three switches. One of these three switches needs to be the main unit (sku #12727), and the two others are auxiliary (this #12728). If your circuit only has a single switch, that single switch must be the main unit (#12727), not the auxiliary unit. It is NOT a good idea to mix Z-Wave with non-Z-Wave (""dumb"") switches on the same circuit. It's the main switch (#12727), not the auxiliary (#12728), that pairs with the Z-Wave network and that gets programmed. I have three of these circuits in my house, all professionally installed, and they work like a charm. Can be programmed into ""scenes"", can be monitored and turned on/off with my smartphone, and can be tied to events (one of these circuits is illuminating the view for security cameras). Yes, they integrate very well into ADT Pulse.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Great Switch - Bad Warranty Support - Consider Another Brand,2.0 ,"Switch installs easily and paired easily with my Wink Hub. Really love the switch. However, the little blue LED indicator light burned out on one of them so I contacted customer support. They do not have an express replacement policy so it becomes a long ordeal for you to get a replacement for the defective one. You must uninstall, then ship to them, then wait, then they ship a replacement. Depending on where you live, that could be 3 weeks without your light switch. Very inconvenient. So, a great switch with a useless warranty. If they improved their customer service, this would be a 5 star product.

"A good switch, but not great, and certainly not awesome",3.0 ,"This is a good switch, but its not deserving of four or five stars. Here's why: 1. It is very deep. I had to go get an ""old work"" box just so that the existing wiring could fit. Changing that box out took me hours. 2. It does not allow reversing the hot/line wires. Plenty of other smart switches allow it, guess they detect it somehow.. this one doesn't. 3. It required me to run my white wire (neutral) into the box.. but never clearly stated it. While it seems obvious to anyone who has installed smart switches before, this was my first, and it wasn't obvious what I should do. Dumb switches usually have hot in, line out, and that's it, so its not intuitive to add the white wire. They should make that clear. 4. Its white wire requirement cost even MORE space (that I didn't have) because I had to add another white wire to the mix 4. It clicks when it turns off or on 5. That blue light is slightly absurd 6. It had little tabs I had to tear off to make two fit next to each other. 7. It is not a specialist switch. The documentation contained information for 3 or 4 switches, and dozens of modes, and I had to wade through some nonsense to find information for my use case. Some might see this as an advantage, instead of a drawback, but not me. I ordered the switch based on my use case, if I had need of a different switch, I would have ordered it. Even though my critique may seem a bit harsh, I am still happy with the purchase. I did not send the product back or shelf it in my shed. I used it, and smiled when it started working. However, in my eyes a product should be perfect to get five stars, and at least have zero undocumented surprises to get four. Most of the switches in my home cost $3, this one cost ~$50.. so I think it should be held to a higher standard. One could argue against any one of my bullet points, but each is an actual drawback. Sure, the clicking is inherent in smart switches, and its deep nature is because of its control board... etc, etc.. but in my view those things are for the manufacturer to figure out, not me.. and when they do, they'll get five stars.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Controlled via Honeywell Lynx5100 You must have a Neutral wire for these to work, the documentation showed a neutral but did not specify you needed one.

Works great for ADT PULSE,5.0 ,"This switch works great as a 2-way switch. If you need to use it as a three way you also need (1) 45610. To use it as a 4-way you will need (2) 45610's. The 45610 is a auxilliary switch and does not have an led on the bottom; it also does NOT have a LOAD terminal just ground, common, and traveler. The 45609 and 45610 do come as a kit called the 45614. The 45614 will contain (1) 45609 and (1) 45610. Very easy to install, directions were pretty clear but i'm not a novice DIY'er and do have an electrical background. These switches WILL work with ADT PULSE.

"Pricey, but does the job",3.0 ,"I use this with my Z-wave system to control my AC when I'm not at home to ensure my pets don't over heat (the ac turns back to the same state after power loss). My only issue is that for the cost, you would think you'd get to choose which outlet is controlled by the Z-wave relay, but unfortunately only the buttom outlet is controllable. This means I had to use a power strip to plugin my AC because my AC plug would otherwise obstruct the entire outlet. My other gripe is the cost, they aren't any cheaper than movable plug adapters (like Belkin's WeMo), and when you consider the cost of the parts, the markup doesn't make much sense; I likely won't buy another until they are $20 or less as I find the wall plugs to be more a better value as you can re-purpose them.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Great Switch,5.0 ,"Only issue I had was that my existing light switch used only a Load and Line wire. I was able to look online and see that it requires a ""white"" wire or common wire to work.

"Works great, but wire per instructions",5.0 ,"I ordered 3 of these switches. Based on other reviews I was a bit worried about the reliability since many reviewers note receiving defective switches. However, all the ones I received worked flawlessly. One word of advice - you must wire the switch according to the labels. Specifically, you cannot interchange the load and line wires as you can with most ""dumb"" switches. I ran into this myself when I wired in one of the switches exactly like the old switch was wired (with the addition of the neutral). When the new switch didn't work I got worried. After mapping out the wiring diagram in the switch box I realized what the problem was. The line and load wires were reversed, which was just fine for the old switch. Because these switches have powered components, they will not work without following the exact wiring instructions. One other note about the wiring. Most existing switches you'll encounter do not wire into the neutral. In my case these were all bundled together inside the box with a wire connector cap. To connect the neutral with the z-wave switch you'll need to provide your own wire that goes from the switch to the bundle. I went to Home Depot and got some extra wire, in addition to a larger wire bundle connector to accommodate the extra gauge of wire.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Great wall switch, plug ins better",3.0 ,"Get the job done. Include button also doubles as on/off manual switch for the top light. They do not come with a face plate, so you will have to buy an extra one. The switch is very deep, so make sure you have room in your electrical boxes to install. Have not had any trouble out of them in the 5 months of having them installed. Excellent connectors make install easier, as no wiring nuts are required. Simply remove the old and connect the wires directly into this switch. Takes <5 minutes to install, but sometimes >10 mins to find the right circuit breaker! Works great with Vera Lite controller. Note that only the top plug is switchable. The bottom plug is live 100% of the time. Looking at it again, I would probably just stick with plug in modules next time.

Great addition to a home automation setup,5.0 ,"I bought three of these with three of the add-on switches(12728) to do a couple rooms in my house and they have worked flawlessly so far. The pictures in the instructions do a pretty good job of helping translate from a usual 3-way setup to these switches. The wiring in my house has always been a mess but with a little testing of the wires I ended up getting them to work fine. Note that these are fairly bulky so if you have gang boxes and you're patient enough it may help to take everything out and shorten the lengths of wire that are unneeded. It took some pushing and using the screws to pull them all the way into the box due to everything behind them. I also had to break some pieces of plastic off my switch plates because they didn't want to sit close to the large metal face. Important note- When attaching the switch plate, you may be tempted to use the screws that were already in it(assumin you are replacing existing switches). The package includes screws for a good reason; the standard ones are usually too long. You'll find that if you tighten a regular screw all the way in the light will suddenly turn off. I don't know if this is some sort of safety feature or if it is shorting the internal circuit, but I found that backing the screw out and cycling the air-gap switch fixed it. The default behavior is to slowly fade on and off but this can be changed through your home automation gateway. We'd prefer that they turn on/off instantly and that requires changing some settings. I have the Veralite and although I couldn't find any documentation there is some on different styles of GE Z-wave dimmers and that ended up working. In device options set Parameter 9 (number of steps. Valid Values: 1-99) to 99 and Parameter 10 (timing of the steps. Valid Values: 1-255) to 1. This affects the settings when using the physical switches. If you want to change how they behave with Z-wave control, use the same logic on parameters 7 and 8, respectively.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Works, but caution they are cheaply made.",3.0 ,"I have used a few of these on my z-wave system. They work , but here are the bad parts.. Electronics are cheap. Have replaced 2 of them so far after about a year, they just stop working, burn up , whatever.. cheap components. The blue LED is to bright at night, It needs to be turned off.. Tape works fine,. but really I don't need a super bright night light in every room. Lastly, while these are about 1/2 the price of a Leviton z-wave outlet, you will over time end up replacing them for component failure, dfo your self a favor go with Levion, solid performers, I have many of them and they have been in the z-wave market much longer.

"Works very well and is reliable, but not trivial to install",5.0 ,"I have nothing but good things to say about this switch. Mine's been turning our porch light on and off automatically (controlled by an alarm.com security system) for many months without a hitch. Beyond doing what it's supposed to, and looking like a normal switch, there's not terribly much more than can be said. Most people won't use any of the advanced features of the switch (like the ability to turn off the blue light) because to do so requires an advanced controller (which I don't have, either). UPDATE: it's now been turning on and off our porch light every day without fail for about a year and a half now. Perhaps the most useful thing I can say in this review is to warn people that installing it is easy, but not trivial. It's not just another switch, which you can wire by just copying the wiring from the switch it replaces. With this Z-wave switch, you need to wire both the load and hot wires in the correct places, but you'll also need to wire in a neutral wire. So, one problem is that if you have an older house, or a poorly wired one, you may not have a neutral in the box at all. You won't be able to use this switch safely, if this is the case. (Please don't try using ground as a neutral! It may work, but its NOT safe.) If you don't have a neutral, or don't know how to figure that out, you can always get the GE 45612 Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control In-Wall Dimmer . The dimmer DOES install just like a regular switch, and can always replace any existing switch. If you aren't confident you can figure out which are the hot, neutral and load wires in your box, you should hire an electrician to install this or just get the dimmer I mention above. It's often not as simple as just going by color, because things aren't always wired the way they should be. You'll need to know how to use a voltage tester to truly determine which is which, and that means getting near live wires. Normal switches couldn't care less if you swap load and hot, but this switch needs all the wires to be exactly correct. This fact is probably why there are a smattering of negative reviews from people who think they have a bad unit. Certainly some are right, but I suspect many of them were trusting the color coding of the wires in their box and just wired the unit with the wrong polarity. Good luck, and have fun!","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Easy Installation, Great Product",5.0 ,"I purchased one of these receptacles, along with a GE 45601 Controller, to allow me to remotely control a recirculation pump. Unfortunately the range wasn't sufficient, so I bought a few more and scattered them around the house. Each works as a ""relay"" station for the controller's signal, so it greatly extended the controller's range and allows me to control the aforementioned pump, as well as any of the other Z-Wave receptacles, when using the controller anywhere in the house. Great. As noted in descriptions, one of the outlets (the upper, in normal installation) is powered all the time. The lower is controlled by the Z-Wave controller, or can be manually turned on and off by a small switch in the center of the outlet. Also, regarding the blue LED that some have complained about: Yes, it is bright. Yes as delivered it is on when the lower outlet is not powered, and not illuminated when the outlet is powered. Counter-intuitive perhaps, but it is user changeable using the 45601. Lastly, installation was a snap. Although larger than a standard outlet, it fits easily into the junction box. Be aware that although the picture shows it with a cover plate, it does not come with one.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

A fantastic addition to my SmartThings & Google Home smart home,5.0 ,"I've replaced 7 of my ""dumb"" switches at home with the GE Z-Wave Plus Wireless Smart Lighting Dimmer & Control Switch. Pros: + The installation process is simple, however, be aware that a pre-existing neutral wire is required. Yes, required. Don't attempt any workarounds at the cost of your safety or the safety of your family. + Integrates seamlessly into my SmartThings/Google Home/Alexa smart home + Signal range is adequate. My SmartThings base is installed on the first floor, and my switches are all over the house on the first and second level of a 3000 sq ft home. + Dimming control is intelligent. It remembers the last level of brightness you set, so if you turn on the switch it returns to its last brightness setting. Handy to set at night and use in the morning when baby duty calls. + This is a cost-effective alternative to replacing an entire series of bulbs with wi-fi enabled smart bulbs. + This is a great option for those who have a handicap or are disabled and need more accessibility to switches in the home through smart connectivity.

Easy install,5.0 ,"This a single switch. On/off simple. Does not rock it only clicks slightly for on or off. No cover plate included. It must be wired with 4 wires. Load, line, neutral and ground. A wall switch is usually just two wires since all it does is breaks the circuit. If your lucky the neutral (white) wire was brought in the same box as where your wall switch is at. Then there is the regular green ground wire. The wire connections are simple. The unit comes with the pre-set screws open. Get your wires ready to push in. With your screw driver push down on the screw first for each connection then push your wire into the hole. This lets the inside pressure plate open up while you got the screw driver ready to tighten. Now slowly tighten down. You should only twist about 5-7 times. The wire should be tight now. Don't over tighten as this will crack the housing! Once it's wired up and powered up go back to your controller to add, then press the bottom of the switch to learn it with your controller. If it doesn't work with your controller delete then add it back. I had to do it twice for the controller to start controlling it. I thought it was broke but that was my fix for it. The unit has a slight clicking noise which is normal from the relay.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

The Echo was a breeze to setup and is working flawlessly - great purchase! The Wink hub connected to the Amazon ...,2.0 ,"After reading a lot of product reviews here on Amazon and checking the questions to see if I would be running into any problems I ordered 3 of these switches. The Amazon Prime order was promptly filled and delivered on time. I also purchased a Wink hub (from Home Depot - cheaper price than Amazon Prime) and an Amazon Echo. My intent was to create a voice control for my patio and office lights. The Echo was a breeze to setup and is working flawlessly - great purchase! The Wink hub connected to the Amazon Echo without a problem, and now I was set to install the smart switches. A little background on my house; it was built in 1946 and therefore did not include a ground wire in any of the switch boxes. No problem, the GE switch install paperwork, the GE switch box and all that I could find on the web said that I only need have a neutral (white) wire and black wire available - no problemo - Installed the switches, they all worked in manual mode, but try as I might, they would not go into pairing mode when attempting to join them to the Wink hub. According to the GE pamphlet all I needed to do was touch the top, or the bottom of the switch after setting the Wink hub to pairing mode and presto! it should work. Son-a-&$#@) - It would not pair. After a long hold on the line I was able to get to the GE tech support department. BAD EXPERIENCE! The woman who was ""helping"" me had a very bad attitude from the get-go. After explaining how I hooked up the wires to the switch and hearing her typing feverously in the background she came back with the ""obvious"" conclusion that I did not have a ground wire attached. This is ""REQUIRED"" she boasted - Well! I responded, If was so damned required why does it not say so anywhere in the literature included with the product, or on the out-side of the box. It clearly says a neutral wire is required. It does NOT say a ground wire is required. It also says it works with any type of switch wiring. Wow! Was I pissed. After a couple of beers I got to thinking that there must be a way to get these working - (light bulb above my head turns on here). I cut a piece of wire and attached it to the ground terminal on the switch (about 4 inches long.). As the switch box I was trying to connect to is made of plastic there was nowhere to ""ground it to"" so I just left it dangle. I set the Wink hub back to pairing mode and as instructed by the switch install guide, I pressed and released the bottom (or top) of the switch . . . . . After about 4 or 5 seconds the switch paired with the hub. I then was able to get Alexa to discover my new devices and I now have a working voice activated light on my patio. I did the same for the switch to my front porch light and to my office and they too paired without complaint. The only thing I can think of for the ground wire needing to be attached is to provide an antenna for the pairing. It does not seem to have any other function as I removed them before closing the switch plates and everything still works normally. So the moral of this story is two-fold. 1) Never believe a tech support person who has to type your questions into a computer to get an answer - that is still wrong. 2) American ingenuity is still alive and well. P.S. I mentioned to her that I had read the reviews and questions here on Amazon before purchasing and was promptly told by her ""We don't pay any attention to Amazon reviews"". Nice to know GE cares about its customers opinions of their products and services. P.S.S. The two stars are not for the product itself but for the install guide and product requirements as listed in their own literature and on the outside of the box and for the lousy tech support I received..

Ideal and Simple (& Works with Schlage/Nexia),5.0 ,"There is not much one can say about a device that either works as intended or it doesn't but I will try in case there are those who, like me a few months ago, are interested in modifying their house to keep up with the modern age: I had installed and set up the Schlage Home Link system beginning with a front door deadbolt lock, a light module and the ""Bridge"" included in the starter package I bought. Slowly I added devices. I bought wall switches and the Trane HVAC control. It was all relatively simple to integrate. I believe the simplest device I added was this Z-Wave outlet. The wiring was very simple and enrolling it as an addition to my ""smart home network"" was a breeze. It works as intended and has not failed yet. Product details: It does NOT come with a wall plate! One of the two plugs in the outlet is Z-Wave enabled while the other is always ""hot"". This means if you plug something in (to this particular plug), it will work as any other household plug. The Z-Wave-enabled plug will be active if it is set to ""active"" through your Z-Wave interface. I use my computers as well as a cell phone application. I leave the light plugged into it ""on"" and activate it through the interface. You can also activate it with the button located between the two plugs (next to a blue LED - described next). One issue some might not like about the outlet is that it puts out a pretty powerful light from the blue LED. This does not bother me in the least and therefore have not looked into whether or not it can be disabled. A bonus to this is that it is useful if attempting to plug something in while the room is dark (or, as previously mentioned, you need to activate the plug when no computer or cell phone app is handy). I will update this if I discover that the LED can be disabled. For those not interested in computer or cell phone control: There are handheld interfaces that will control all your installed Z-Wave devices.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Now I just have an expensive light switch to manually turn the light on and off. I guess the little blue LED light on the switch was worth the $40 premium I paid for this switch.

Top value z wave plus dimmer on the market,4.0 ,"Amazon lumps nearly all of the GE Z wave items under the same reviews, this review is specifically for the z wave plus paddle wall dimmer. Bought a number of these and their Jasco equivalents to connect to my Smarththings hub to control the lights via app and Alexa on echo dots. Evaluating these as a manual dimmer, these are very very good when compared to some Feit and Leviton LED dimmers I've tried. The Feit dimmer from Costco was the worst; it suffered from an ill fitting wall plate that left gaps to the wall, ever so slight buzzing (even with Feit Led's!), and it had power issues; dim it too low and you induce flicker or the light wont' turn back on because the initial power draw is too low. Using it required, dimming to a level that is satisfactory from both a output and power draw standpoint to make sure one can turn the lights on and off. The Leviton unit addressed all these shortcomings but at $20-30 was rather expensive even without z wave, some models are cheaper but none of them are what I would call cheap. This GE or really Jasco unit strikes an excellent compromise on all fronts as a mechanical dimmer; no buzzing with Cree or Feit LED retrofits, dims smoothly with no power on/off issues. The only drawback as a mechanical dimmer is that there is no dedicated slider; you hold he up/down paddle as needed to get to desired light level. The inclusion of Z wave is where this shines and the value proposition increases when compared to a $20-30 mechanical dimmer. With a smartthings hub, it's now a dimmer, a timed switch, alarm signal, etc. I have 3 generations of these in the house; early gen with no neutral wire, z wave with neutral wire, and now z wave plus. The latest gen supports scenes better but I haven't quite explored in that direction yet so the only notable differences to me are in installation and dimming performance; the latter two have about equivalent performance while the early gen was easier to install due to one less wire it also doesn't dim as low. Given minimal cost differences, it makes sense to buy the latest gen for future functionality upgrades. From an install perspective, these are quite big and bulky but manageable. The contact points are clearly labeled (neutral, line, load, ground, remote) and makes me wish regular switches were labeled too but alas that is often not the case since there are a myriad of ways to wire them. With a voltage meter in hand it should be easy to figure out the wires; colors are usually white is neutral, bare is ground, and black can be line or load. The voltage meter makes it easy to figure out and worth the $20 as part of your general toolbox; turn off breaker, pull switch out to expose wires, turn on breaker, set meter to detect 200V AC and touch one lead to ground and the other to either black line withe power on and whichever shows ~120V is the line wire aka ""hot"". Turn off the breaker and proceed to install safely. You'll have quite a bit of wire and switch to cram back in so the flexible neutral white wire they pack in takes at least some of the pain out. All the contacts are push in screw type so no need to break out pliers to bend wire around the screw terminals. Once I got the hang of identifying wires, it became easy to upgrade throughout the house and I'm onto 9 switches already! so buyer beware, these get addictive.....","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Finally looked at the packaging and it stated clear as day that this was not for LED's or CFL bulbs. Dangit!! So, I figured Amazon shipped me the wrong thing, because how could I be wrong?

"Works great, easy install",4.0 ,"I purchased 5 of these 2 way on/off switches to remotely control the lights in my house. Replacing the existing switches with these Z-Wave ones were relatively straightforward. My old switches only used 2 wires (Line [Hot] and Load) while these switches use 4 wires (Line, Load, Neutral, and Ground). Like most electricians would suggest, I also recommend using the screw terminals instead of the push terminals. On one switch I was lazy and used the push terminals and the wire kept popping out (even if I tightened the screw which made no difference). Note that the Z-Wave switch is pretty bulky and will take up about 75-80% of the work box space so if you're installing into a work box that has multiple switches, make sure there's enough room (depth-wise). Adding the switches to my Mi Casa Verde Vera 2 was painless and these switches are detected right away (Just press up and then down to sync). The blue LED is nice and not overpowering. You can easily find the switch in the dark. The relay in the switch makes a clicking noise when you turn it on/off, but it's pretty quiet, no complaints here. Switches work great and I would give them a 5 star rating if the depth was half the size.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Not very good instructions,4.0 ,"First of all, I'm not an electrician but I understand the basic concepts of electricity, since I deal with electricity with my job. I decided to replace a pair of basic light switches with these Z-Wave light switches. The ones I was replacing only had Line, Load and Ground on them, with all of the Neutral wires bundled in the back of the switch box. These Z-Wave switches REQUIRE a Neutral to turn on. I beat my head against a wall for about 30 minutes trying to figure out how to get the Neutral wire to work with this switch. I tried the Neutral wire on the Line side and the Neutral from the Load side. It wouldn't work with either one. The instructions weren't the best, so I went to the trusty internet to find a solution. Turns out if you run an additional Neutral wire from the Z-Wave switch, and bundle it with the other Neutral wires in the switch box it works perfectly. I was able to connect it to my house alarm and am able to operate the lights via my cell phone or computer. They turn on and off my porch and entry lights so if I'm away for a vacation or something like that I can turn them on and off to give the appearance of the house being occupied. Also if I forget to turn the lights off when I leave, I can turn them off remotely. Also, if you are putting 2 of these side by side, you may have to trim off the aluminum tabs that are on the sides. I bought the Lutron CW-2-WH 2-Gang Claro Wall Plate, White face plate to go over the top of my switches, and had to trim the tabs to get the switches to line up with the face plate. Some of my problems may be common sense to an electrician who has installed some of these switches before, but as I said I'm not an electrician, so I gave my layman review. I only gave 4 stars because I had to do some leg work to figure out how to install them, but really if there were some better instructions it would have easily been 5 stars.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Great but needs to improvements,4.0 ,"I had some difficulty setting up the device but that was more related to my SmartThings Hub. Otherwise, setup is very easy. The biggest part that they could improve on is the fit. If you intend on having two of these switches next to each other and having a cover, which most of us will, the metal frame is too large. At first I tried putting one frame in front of the other and it still wouldn't fit. Eventually, I had to take a Dremel to shave down the metal frame to allow for the switches to be close enough to each other to fit a cover. The back of the device is pretty bulky, so you may have to trim some of the wires behind it to allow for room. If you are running the switch solo then it won't be a big deal but I had to make some unwanted modifications. I'd still give it 4 Stars based on its functionality, ease of setup, and range.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Easy to set up & works great with SmartThings and Alexa (Echo, Dot)",5.0 ,"I started with two of the toggle-style switches to get my outdoor lights connected to my SmartThings hub.

It took some working with old wires to get the switches to fit in a smaller 50-year-old gang box, but was still only 15 or 20 minutes for two switches. (An obligatory caution for those who haven't done basic electrical work before: amperage is unforgiving: you can only mess up once!) All in all, I couldn't be happier with this foire into the world of smart home automation. I look forward to the next sale so I can buy a bunch more.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Doesnt fit in older metal multi-gang boxes,2.0 ,"I just attempted to install this switch into a multi gang box that I had in my kitchen. The wiring was simple and the instructions were good, although I didn't really read them. Once wired, I tested the switch and it worked great. When I went to reassemble and push the switch into the switch box it would not fit. The plastic housing with the electronics and z-wave stuff maxemizes every available millimeter available it seems. My metal gang box that I had in my location has raised areas at the top and the bottom between each gang, and though not very big, they are big enough to prevent install of this switch completely.

Great smart dimmer 3-way solution,4.0 ,"This is an add-on that works with the GE Smart Dimmer control. Documentation is lacking, so I'll clarify that you must use this with the GE Smart Dimmer on existing multi-switch (e.g. 3-way or 4-way) wiring; you cannot simply add this switch anywhere in the home where a neutral wire exists and try to ""pair it"" with another GE smart dimmer. Once that limitation is understood, this product works exactly as intended, is easy to install, and has the advantage over regular ""dumb"" 3-way switches in that this also works as a dimmer, allowing you to control the lighting level from any of the GE Smart Dimmers in this wiring configuration. All the great features you get with the primary smart dimmer switch are part of that product's review, since this one is simply an add-on switch. One star removed only due to lacking a nice-to-have feature: would be nice to be able to install anywhere and pair with the ""master"" without requiring 3-way switch wiring.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Stand alone and 3-way switches,5.0 ,"I recently bought two 12722 in-wall paddle switches and one 12723 add-on switch for use in a 3-way setup. I use them with a Wink Hub 2 and Alexa. There was a little trial and error involved, but that was more first-time DIY than any of the switches' fault. That said, once I got past my minor error it was a cinch. It helps to have a multimeter in case you are unsure which black wires are load and line. I swapped them on the first try and didn't think to check with my multimeter until well after. DOH!!! TIPS: -It helps to have a multimeter on hand in case you need to verify things. -If you're wiring a 3-way, you will need a spare wire nut to complete the job. -The backs of these switches are pretty bulky, adjust and move wires in the box as much as possible. -Because these switches make the wiring in the box extra crowded, I recommend placing some electrical tape over all your screw terminals, especially if your ground wires in the box are just bare copper. -Those spacer tabs on the switches are ridiculous and you'll almost definitely need to remove them if it's not the only switch in the box. Do so before you start. -Don't forget to use the jumper wire that comes with these switches to connect to neutral. -The metal plate that frames the switches was thicker than on my old switches that were staying in the box with them. I had to carve a slight recess so that the new switches and old switches would line up flush once the faceplate was on. -I had one electrical box that was installed too deeply into the wall and the screws that come with the switches didn't quite reach due to the extra thickness of the metal plate. I bought some longer screws at the hardware store, #6-32 is the screw type you want if you find yourself in the same boat. I wired one room with a single 12722 and it is pretty straight forward. Assuming you don't mix them up like I did, connect your load (black usually or red depending on what was in the switch you're replacing) and line wires (120V common, black) to the corresponding terminals. It's all labeled on the back of the switch. You'll have to connect a ground wire as well as the white neutral wire. Do not remove a neutral from the bundled wire nut in the box, you'll end up with an open neutral and the switch won't work if you connect it that way. Use the white jumper wire that comes with the switch and add it to the bundle of neutral wires. That's it, switch wired! Next I did a 3-way with a 12722 and the 12723 add-on. This is a little different from wiring regular 3-way switches. I recommend first identifying where your primary (zwave switch) is going with your trusty multimeter because it will determine how much work you will have to do. The way my existing 3-way switches were wired, I had 120V on one side only (primary). If I'd wanted to move my primary to the auxiliary side, I would have had to cut and combine wires, placing another wire nut in the box with multiple wire coming out of it. I opted not to do that since space is at a premium. Basically, you just wire the the 12722 zwave switch up like a stand alone on the primary side, but also add the traveler wire (red in my case). On the auxiliary side, the 12723 add-on switch is only going to need neutral (jumper!), ground, and the traveler (match the color from the primary side). The add-on does not use the load or line wires that were plugged into the old auxiliary switch at all. Instead you need a spare wire nut so you can combine these two together and then shove them into the back of the box. Basically, this means that only the primary zwave switch will be switching power to the load. The add-on switch is only there to tell the primary via the traveler that its button was pressed which causes the primary to switch on/off.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Great product, a little tough for installation without the best instructions",4.0 ,"Okay, first, the product does exactly what it is supposed to. It works as a 3-way or 4-way switch on a circuit in your house as long as you have the GE primary switch in that circuit. One cool feature is that up is always on, down is always off, and if your primary switch is a summer then this one will also dim the lights. So, instead of a single dimmer on a multi-switch circuit, you have dimmer capabilities on every switch. Now, the bad part, the wiring. If you are an electrician don't worry, everyone else, keep reading. The GE primary switch is the only switch in the circuit that has 110V in it. Once you go this route the other switches have only the low voltage signal provided from the extra terminal on the back of the primary. What this means is if your 3 or 4-way wiring has power on one end, and the light on the other, you need to wire it up to pass the power all the way to the switch with the light, directly, and then wire up the low voltage communication wire to reach the switches in the other direction. Before you start you need to figure out which switches are 3-way and which are 4-way. The four way will have two sets of two wires called travelers. You will find two three way switches, they have one less wire. You need to know which is connected to power and which is connected to the light. The simple way to do this is to disconnect the wires, and carefully measure the voltage when you turn the circuit on. Be careful on this step. So, I will talk about a 4-way, since 3-way is the same without the middle switches. On 4-way you will have two wires coming into the switch and two going out called travelers, these are used to switch the four way circuit. On 3-way installation. there is a single set of travelers, use them as I describe below for the two end switches. On 4-way you usually you'll have a red and black traveler coming in and the same going out. So, for all the 4-way switching in your circuit connect the red in to red out with a screw cap, then black to black. I chose to use the black for power and red for low voltage signal. So, connect ground to the white ground bundle in the outlet, connect the red wires to your only other terminal (low voltage signal) in your add on switch, and you're done with this switch. On the end with the light, you will put your master switch. Connect the incoming black traveler to the 110V terminal, white bundle ground to ground, connect the wire to the light to the light terminal, and the incoming red traveler to the low voltage signal terminal after you remove the tape. This is done. Finally, the other end. You will use an add on switch here, and connect the red traveller to the low voltage terminal. You will connect the power into the outgoing black traveller. You connect the ground to the white bundle in the socket. You are now good to go. All the boxes have the red traveller connected to the low voltage connector. The black traveller connects from one end to 110V hot down to the other into the primary switch hot connector. The light connects to the primary switch light connector. They all have ground. Now turn on the power and you're good to go. [...]","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Great Automatic Light Switch with timer that is easy to set and maintain,5.0 ,Really love this switch it was very easy to install and worked perfectly with with my alarm.com / link interactive system and apps. Easy to schedule control of my lights and I used it on a switch that controls 5 outdoor lights. Very happy with this purchase. It has a small spot that glows blue when the lights are turned off. There is a very soft but audible sound when the switch is turned on or off with the switch. I haven't noticed this when it goes on or off with the timer because I haven't been close enough to hear but I assume it does. You have to be very close to the switch to hear the sound though. I wouldn't hesitate to add more of these switches in the future and will be purchasing additional ones as I need them. I hooked it up myself but had basic electrical knowledge and have installed switches in the past. This switch does require a white wire which is usually available but the switch I was replacing didn't use it so I had to find the nut with a bunch of white wires in the back of the back and connect this switch to that but it worked fine and wasn't a problem....just took a few more minutes to install than a plain light switch that doesn't require that wire.,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Better than a traditional 3-way switch,5.0 ,"I recently wired about 22 Z-wave switches into my home for automation through the Wink hub. In doing so, I experimented with a number of configurations, including this GE 12723 paired with a GE12722 switch for a 3-way configuration. Most of my 3-ways used Lutron Caseta dimmers with remote controls since they were actually a little cheaper than the pair of GE switches, and the Lutron’s provided dimming capabilities. However, this particular switch was connected to my outdoor security lights, and I definitely didn’t want them on a dimmer. The way my house was wired, the hot wire for the 3-way was in the garage box while the load wire was by the front door. I wanted the hot wire to be at the front door so I could see the on/off indicator LED on the switch from inside. I changed the recommended wiring provided by GE to use one of the original traveler wires to send hot to the front door GE 12722 switch. The second traveler wire became the traveler for the connection between the GE 12722 and GE 12723. All in all, it worked like a charm. Why is it better than a traditional 3-way switch? Since the traveler connecting the switches sends on/off signals between the switches, the off position is always off on both switches, and the on position is always on; you don’t have to worry about the switch positions changing every time you turn the switch on or off at a different location. The GE 12722 connects into the Wink hub as a generic Z-wave switch. The current version of software has no problem reading the on/off state of the GE switch. The GE 12723 doesn’t have to be paired with the hub since the GE 12722 does all the Z-wave communications.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Very pleased!!!,5.0 ,"We came close to installing Control 4 until it was explained to us we would have to use a vendor every time we wanted to reprogram a device, something that would become very expensive. This is when we started to explore other solutions. We ended up going with Wink and as such looked at several zwave. devices to prototype. We tried two other switches made by other companies, but ended up buying many many more of these GE switches as we continue to automate the whole house. The automation is just incredible and these switches work perfectly with the Wink system (though I am sure they work with any wave system). We have the house programed with these switches for multiple modes throughout the day. Wakeup for Running, Breakfast, midday, evening, and nighttime moods. Of course Wink robots take care of all that. Then we use the switches as part of If/ then scenarios. If somebody walks up to the front door the z-wave motion sends a signal to wink that confirms this switch is on so our porch, foyer, and living rooms lights are on automatically and this switch responds perfectly everytime. You pay a little more, but all I can say is they work every time. Given how frustrating electronics can be, it is nice to get something that works as advertised, everytime!! I also liked how this switch uses slots in the back, much like the push in slot on regular receptacles - except on these they use a screw to tighten them to ensure they are snug! Makes attaching the wires very easy and quick to install, leaving a lot of space to install the larger space taken up by the switch size itself (a downfall of all the zwave switches - resembles a GFI switch in size, so you can appreciate not needing to use the extra wire nuts. Don't leave many reviews, but these switches earned my recommendation. If I could improve one thing, it would be nice if they used a full LED line under or around the entire paddle to act as a night light or simple to highlight where the switch was at night.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Works Great! Love it!,5.0 ,"I was going to give this 4 stars because of how difficult it was to link up to my Wink Hub... but I decided that wouldn't be fair because the issue was with the Wink App / Hub not this device. The device was easy to install and it only actually took about 10 minutes to install in place of my existing fan switch. They include an extra ""White"" wire in the box so you can run the required ""Neutral"" connection to the device. If you aren't comfortable or knowledgeable with electrical wiring, get someone who is to install this as it does require some electrical skill. Once the unit was installed, I was able to test it manually. Tap the top of the switch to turn the fan on... tap the bottom to turn it off. Press and hold the top to increase the fan speed... press and hold the bottom to decrease the speed. Linking to my Wink controller wasn't as straight forward as I'd hoped. Wink includes a Bar-code Scan option to scan the device bar-code you're installing and Wink will automatically load up the configuration options for you. I scanned the bar-code and Wink told me this was an unsupported device... :( It's not really, it's just not automatic-out-of-the-box. So, I went the manual route. Now, when selecting the device to install, I picked a ""GE In Wall Smart Switch"" from the ""Utilities and Climate"" because that section shows ceiling fans. Tried several times and it kept failing with the ""This is taking too long..."" error. I finally called Wink support (They were very helpful BTW) and got it straightened out pretty quick. They told me I needed to install it as a ""Lighting Dimmer Module""... I wish there was something in the documentation that mentioned this. Even the Wink support page for this device just says ""Follow the manufacturers directions to install"". But the included instructions just say to follow the Z-Wave Controllers Instructions to add the device.... kind of a catch 22. Anyway, with Wink support on the phone, we tried adding it as a ""Lighting Dimmer Module"" and that didn't work... still. So, the tech had me put the hub in ""Z-Wave Exclusion Mode"" (if you're not familiar with this, there's online information) to remove the device from the hub... then put the hub in ""Z-Wave Inclusion Mode"" to add the device... kind of ""Back-Dooring it"". Well, this worked fine and the device showed up as a GE Lamp in my device list. I was able to edit the device and correctly show it as a fan controller by picking a custom icon. The thing works great! It says on the box you can set High, Medium and Low speeds... You have to figure out what % Level in Wink triggers each speed as Wink will allow you to set any percent level 0 - 100% to the module just like a dimmer. But, the unit will only drive the fan in 3 speeds. I believe 20 - 35% is low, 36 - 80% is medium, 81 - 100% is high... at least on mine.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works Very Well,5.0 ,"I have tried Caseta (Lutron), which looks really good, but needs a hub. Customer support was helpful, but could not solve my issue, so I sent it back. Leviton (Decora), which seems okay, but one LED flickers. Also, the paddle looks kind of cheap. So, it is going back. I picked up this GE dimmer at a local store, and it installed so easily. The wire hookups did not require wire nuts, so it took up lees room in the box. Also, it is easy to use. Hold down the bottom paddle and the lights dim. Hold down the upper paddle and the lights bright. Hooked it up to Smart Things with no problem. Just add a thing, and tap the up paddle. In Smart Things, the dimmer behaved exactly like I thought it would. What was cool, is that I slid the dimmer in Smart Things to 0%, and the lights turned off. When I turned them back on, it went to the dim setting it had, before I pulled the dimmer to 0%. Also, no lag time. I press the switch and the lights come on. I press the switch off in Smart Things and the lights fade off (maybe a second or two). Looks really cool. Totally happy, and glad to buy an American product.

"Wonderful, but needs some finishing touches",3.0 ,"This is a general review for all of the GE/Jasco smart switches. These are great little switches. I am very impressed with them and will continue buying them. I got one from Lowes that apparently had a bad radio in it, but upon further inspection, this appeared to be a unit that had already been returned and placed back on the shelf. I have a few issues with these though. 1. if setting up a multi switch circuit, many electricians today, only run the two traveler wires to the second box. This saves money. However, these boxes, REQUIRE a neutral wire (not the earth ground). Using the earth ground will result in a back flow of electricity that may cause your light to turn on even when the switches are off. In addition using the earth ground is unsafe. With that said, GE needs to come up with a way to make a switch pair that will work without a neutral at the second switch. All of the other vendors I have found are the same way, and I would rate them down for that short coming as well. 2. The unit ships with two screws to screw the faceplate (that you provide) to the switch. I didn't use mine instead I just used the ones I already had. However on the dimmer switches, there is a air gap switch that allows you to turn off the switch completely rather than just dim to 0. Apparently if you use a full size screw to attach the faceplate, it presses against something that engages the airgap switch. 3. for multi switch circuit installs, the add-on switches do not have a z-wave radio in them. This means that they cannot be used to extend your zwave network. Yes it would cost a little more, but especially in homes that have not embraced smart switches and z-wave devices the way I have, ever z-wave repeater helps.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Awsome product, slightly annoying delay problem",4.0 ,"This review is for the light switch. I already had a different smart light switch but it connected directly to my WiFi which I really liked seeing as I didn't have a zwave hub at the time. However when it came time to install two of these switches in a single box I ran into a problem because it used wire nuts and extra wires and there wasn't any room for it all in the box. At that point I decided to try these GE light switches. It didn't connect the wires via wire nuts and instead the wires connected directly into the light switch, saving a lot of room. It was still a tight fit considering how much larger these smart switches are but at least it fit. Another pro for this light switch is the rocker remains in a neutral position and you touch the top part to turn the lights on and the bottom part to turn the lights off. Intuitive since this is how all light switches work, the one I replaced had the rocker always in the traditional ""on"" position and you pushed the bottom part of the rocker to toggle between off and on, people were confused as to how to work the light switch the first time they used it. The other pro about these light switches is they come ready to be used in a 3 way switch, seeing as I have about six 3 way switches in my house I also thought it would be good to have all switches be the same rather than have some switches be one kind of switch and the 3 ways be a different kind, so this was a major plus too. Also these switches have a blue light on them that you can control to have the light always on when the switch is on or always on when the switch is off, or never on. It's a nice feature to put this in your control. The only drawback (and the reason this is only getting 4 stars instead of 5) is there is a delay between turning the switch on/off and the lights actually turning on/off. It's not a huge delay, I've timed it and it's about .4 seconds, but it's still pretty annoying considering every switch I have ever used in my entire life has been instant, and this includes the smart switch I was using prior to this GE model. This delay is present when manually operating the switch itself, using my Smart Things app, and when using Amazon Alexa. I've timed it with Alexa and it takes about 3 seconds for the lights to turn on via Alexa, whereas my old smart switch took about 1.5 seconds, via the Smart Things app it's really about the same delay as manually touching the switch, about .4 seconds. Again not the end of the world but slightly annoying. I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, just kind of weird that they would design this with a delay seeing as apparently it's possible to create a smart switch that does not have a delay.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

works with wink app and alexa with an addon swtich for 3-way,5.0 ,"works perfect with the wink app and then with alexa too. we ahve a 3way so we also got the add-on switch. your switch will control the light and take power, but hte addon only needs the traveler and the ground - the two switches communicate from zigbee and essentially the main switch is the only one that will control the light. the only issue we had was figuring out our wires. we got the addon for the second swtich and that was the complicated part! :-) our wiring was ridiculous. in the dining room we had 3 black wires, one red, copper, white. so we know the neutral is white and the copper is ground, red should be the traveler (to communicate between switches).... what were the 3 blacks? one was a second traveler we found out and second was power and the third for some reason was the wall circuit in the living room! we had the kitchen light on (what this was for) but the TV in the living room stopped working! ugh! haha. and the dining room connection did not have a wire to the light. (this proved difficult as this is where this swtich has to go and the addon switch goes in the living room - but the addon switch only has a port for the ground and traveler. it has no power or load port. ended up having to double hook up the wall circuit one with the power in (this one has two ports for each connection so YAY) and put the second (blakc) traveler on the load port, the red traveler on the travler port MAKE SURE YOU HOOK UP THE NEUTRAL AND GROUND or it wont work. then on the addon switch, we took the red traveler into the traveler port and connected teh grond (these are the only two ports available). then we had the wire to the light hanging there and the second (blakc) traveler,. we twisted those together and bam! finally worked!!!! now alexa ... turn on the kitchen light works! love it!","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
YOU MIGHT NEED A WIRE NUT,5.0 ,"If you've already installed one of the master switches, one of these is super easy. It doesn't even take load/line wires - just Neutral, Traveler, and Ground. On that note, it's not obviously clear in the instructions that you DO need to connect the line and load wires back together in the box. I guess it's obvious when you actually think about how electricity works, but at least in my box, there was no wire nut on either the load or line wires. Fortunately, I had an extra wire nut I could use to connect them together, and I was good to go. Otherwise - easy install, great result, highly addictive. **Update: Amazon has since consolidated this with the main switch, so I can only add images to this review. I'm adding a basic diagram of what I did to wire up 4 switches in the same gangbox. **Update #2: I've recently discovered you can actually daisy-chain these switches because each one has two connector ports for each wire type. That means you can have a neutral wire coming in and then another coming out that you can route to the next GE switch - no need to route them both individually to a big wire nut in the back!","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Great addition to a home automation setup,5.0 ,"The main thing to start out with is that this is an add-on switch and WILL NOT control lights on it's own. It can't switch 120V itself but is meant to be used with something such as the GE 12729 dimmer. I purchased 3 pairs of the 12729 and 12728 to set up three rooms of my house. Setup- Definitely read the instructions and consult an electrician if you need but I'll describe it in my own words. The easiest was to think of this switch is as a remote that controls the main Z-wave enabled one. Where a normal 3 or 4-way setup will run one power wire(line) to the first switch then through two wires(usually black and red) until the last switch and one(load) to the light, in this case the power(line) goes to the GE 12729, and right on to the light. Because you run the main switch right to the light, where the in-between old switches had a black in and black out, just wire-nut these together so power is uninterrupted to the light. Then, where the old ones had a red in and red out, these are what you hook up to this item. You can daisy chain as many as you want back to the control switch. The wiring in my house has always been a mess but with a little testing of the wires I ended up getting them to work fine. Note that these are fairly bulky so if you have gang boxes and you're patient enough it may help to take everything out and shorten the lengths of wire that are unneeded. It took some pushing and using the screws to pull them all the way into the box due to everything behind them. I also had to break some pieces of plastic off my switch plates because they didn't want to sit close to the large metal face. Important note- When attaching the switch plate, you may be tempted to use the screws that were already in it(assuming you are replacing existing switches). The package includes screws for a good reason; the standard ones are usually too long. You'll find that if you tighten a regular screw all the way in the light will suddenly turn off. I don't know if this is some sort of safety feature or if it is shorting the internal circuit, but I found that backing the screw out and cycling the air-gap switch fixed it. These have worked flawlessly for months now on a Veralite so I would highly recommend. See my review on GE 12729 for some tips on Z-wave control settings.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Works reliably well. Once installed and programmed, you forget it's there",4.0 ,"Switch works reliably well. This switch, #12727 is the main unit in any Z-Wave controlled light circuit. This is the device that pairs with your Z-Wave router and that does get programmed. If your circuits has more than one switch, the other switches need to be ""auxiliaries"" (sku #12728). Example: a foyer light that has three switches. One of these three switches needs to be the main unit (sku #12727), and the two others are auxiliary. If your circuit only has a single switch, that single switch must be the main unit (#12727), not the auxiliary unit. It is NOT a good idea to mix Z-Wave with non-Z-Wave (""dumb"") switches on the same circuit. I have three of these circuits in my house, all professionally installed, and they work like a charm. Can be programmed into ""scenes"", can be monitored and turned on/off with my smartphone, and can be tied to events (one of these circuits is illuminating the view for security cameras). Yes, they integrate very well into ADT Pulse.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works great with Alexa and Google Home,5.0 ,"Finally found a fan switch that I can control the speed of the fan with voice commands. This works great with SmartThings and controlling the fan with the SmartThings app, Alexa or Google Home. It does get recognized as a dimmer with SmartThings but it is just using the 3 speeds and not infinite settings like someone mentioned. When you tell Alexa to set the speed at a range between 1and 32%, it uses the low setting, between 33 and 66% it uses the medium setting and above that, it uses the high setting. So for example, if I say ”Alex, set the fan to 50%”, the fan speed will be set to the medium speed setting. One quirk with Google Home is that she will return a response something like ""setting the fan brightness to 50%"" because of SmartThings recognizing the switch as a dimmer. All in all, I am very satisfied with the switch.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Good, but some info. I wish I had at the beginning.",4.0 ,"I dont normally write reviews but I thought I would since there is some conflicting information here and some info. I wish I had when I started. First, the unit operates as expected and the paring with my hub was no problem. A couple of notes on the install. First the infamous neutral wire. I've seen comments/answers saying you do and you do not need one. I'm experience you absolutely need it. Also, this is not the ground wire. It's different. I was initially confused because my existing switches didnt have a neutral wire but my house is fairly new. Also, it didnt help I didnt know what a neutral wire was. After some research and pulling everything out of the electrical box I found the house had a neutral wire it just wasnt used/needed for the switches I had so it was just twisted into the back of the electrical box. I expect this may be the case for many others. Also, the instructions with the switch dont actually show the neutral connected to the switch in the diagram, it's just mentioned briefly. The second thing to note is that if you are doing this for a 3-way switch install you have to also buy the add on switch(s). A 3-way switch is when you have one light controlled by more than one switch. So one switch has to be this one and all others for that light need to be replaced with the add on switch. This may be obvious to an electrician or networking type person but wasnt to me. Ultimately I'm happy with the finished product I just wish some of the instructions were presented a little more obviously.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

End of line switch users -- BEWARE -- Two updates,3.0 ,"UPDATE ADDED AT END OF INITIAL REVIEW ... I want to write this review because I hope it saves someone from having a wasted two days like i just had after buying this yesterday. Bottom line up front ... if you have an end of line switch -- which can be determined by looking at the switch once removed from the box. If it has one line of wire coming in and within that wire, it contains a white, black and a ground wire -- that's an end of line. What that means is that the electricity is coming from the light fixture to the switch vice the opposite. Now, many reviewers will tell you that you don't need a common (usually white) wire. The reviewers and many experts will tell you that the solution is to determine the load and line and simply install them to their corresponding places on the switch. Well, here's some problems with all that. First, end of line wiring involves (for reasons only real electricians know) that the white wire that ultimately appear in your box is wired to a black wire and thus becomes ""hot."" The black wire goes from the light to the receptacle is used to essentially relay the switch command to the light. Now, if that black wire is going to do that, how does it also perform the function of a common wire, which involves transmitting low level electricity to the switch and guess what? Without it, as Doc Brown would say, ""This damned thing doesn't work!"" Now to say I had an adventure would be a great understatement. I've installed a WEMO switch, installed about ten wireless devices ranging from MyQ, to Rainman, to Arlo, to 110 outlets with USB outlets, to TPC lighting to Nest Thermostats (three, including the most complex -duel fuel). That said, I don't claim to be an electrician and I am smart enough to know that it will kill you or burn your house down or both. But I am capable of reading, research and watching some pretty good videos that are out there. I spent much of the last two days trying the find the answer to my issue ... copy and paste this link [...] ... this is the only reference (and I looked at thousands of pages) that discusses this issue. I tried various tricks and made many mistakes. First mistake was assuming the black was the line and the white the load. That's not right for the reason outlined previously. I tried the white wire (which keep in mind is HOT) into the common position and was lucky to notice the switch was getting warm ... not right. I tried as many will tell you -- hot wire to line and other wire to load ... it won't even power on in that mode. I tried hot wire to line and black wire (common) to common -- it was then that I got the blue LED power indicator .. and Smart Things detected the switch in a few second flat. Here was the problem ... no way to turn the lights off. I was actually using this on a ceiling fan/light that I new when I installed it 15 years ago that I'd be largely reliant on largely pull chains. But when I hooked the switch up hot to line and black wire to common -- in addition to not being able to turn the lights off -- when I put more than one blub in, they went into a blinking mode. The fan also would not respond. So, after a score two of tripping to the basement two floors below, where my main breaker box is located, I found this ... no common wire at the end of the line equals this switch being worthless. I do have two other candidate locations in my house, so I'm going to give those a try there. As bad as I hate to add about the fourth brand name of wireless device, but I'm going to have to shop for one that requires no common wire. My first thought when reflecting on my adventure is that I'm really not only disappointed at GE and the makers for not having this little tidbit in their description or at least more detail about this potential issue. But in the end, I'll just chalk up this adventure as being beneficial for future electrical experiences. UPDATE: I moved this device down to my foyer where there is a double gang that controls the foyer light and the outside porch lights. I decided to relocate the switch there because I thought it might be easier than placing it in a three gang box that controls my flood lights (another location that I'll add a wireless switch). When I got the switch cover off and the screws out to see what was in the box, I saw the bundled white wires and then something I hadn't previously noticed -- I had changed out to paddle switches throughout the house a couple of years ago, so I have some familiarity with the wiring in the house -- but I unexpectedly found one black wire on the switch that controls the foyer lights was wrapped around one of the screws on the paddle -- I'm sure it was wired this way when the house was built and I'd simple moved it when installing the paddle switch. That threw me back a bit as far as determining the load and line, then it hit me that the wrapped around wire would be the LINE wire and the other the load. So, I wired those accordingly to the GE wireless switch and then ran the jumper wire from the white bundle to the common connector. I did have to get a larger connector to work with the expanded wiring. I turned the power on and turned the lights on and immediately had control manually over the lights and got the LED when I turned it off and I went to Smart Things and the app almost immediately recognized the switch and the setup was easy. I programmed the lights to come on for about an hour when I normally walk my pups. I turned off the electricity again because I knew it was going to be a challenge to get the larger GE switch to fit in along side the paddle switch. First step is to break off the three tabs on each side. Doing it with needle nose pliers was a challenge so I switch to larger regular pliers -- I had success just securing each tab with the pliers, then moving the switch back and forth until each one broke off. My load wire kept jumping out even when tightened as tight as I could get it. I removed about another 1/8 inch of insulation on the wire to allow it to go deeper into the switch and once I did that, no more problems. Like I said, a challenge to get the wireless switch seated properly in the gang box -- but when I did -- all worked as intended. Please allow me to say this -- this is where GE goes wrong. Their marketing is designed to show how simple the switch is to install and suggest anyone can do the installation. What they miss is that rarely will you find an outlet that is as easy to wire as the scenario they pick in their promos to make it look easy. Chances are, you will not find too many situations like that and you are more apt to be challenged with the end of line scenario I first described and then the challenges with the pigtail wiring or whatever it's called that I encountered at the second location. So, about 15 hours of work, research and a lot of trial and error, I now have the switch installed and working properly. UPDATE ON SECOND INSTALL: I wanted to add a switch for my flood lights and purchased a second one of these from Amazon. This was quite a bit different install as it was in a three gang box that contained TWO different circuits with one having the third (red) wire for switching. If that wasn't enough, I'd had a real electrician run a 110 outlet a few feet below and centered on the wall. He had tied into one of the circuits in the switch box to run that line. I noticed that when I turned of the circuit breaker at the main box and then came back up stairs that my kitchen lights had no power but my dining area's lights were still on. So, I brought out the reliable circuit tester powered by fresh batteries and sure enough, the line I was going to work on had no power but one of the switches was still hot. Since the hot switch was at one end and the switch I wanted to trade out was at the other end, I thought I could make the swap without turning off more power. However, when i got the flood light switch removed from the gang box, I could see all three switches were going to have to be loosened and moved out to do the wiring and arrang several bundles of wires. The trick is to get those bundles behind the two smaller switches where all space is left open to receive the GE switch. I was further advantaged in that I was working on an older gang box that may be somewhat smaller than today's models. The GE furnished common wire turned out to be far too short since I had to run the wire from the white bundle that would be located at opposite ends of the gang box. I had some extra wire laying around and cut a piece about 5 or 6 inches and it turned out I needed every bit of that length. After several minutes of wrangling, I managed to get everything in place. Hardest part was just getting everything lined up and I ended up getting two longer screws than those provided to seat the switch on the gang. When I powered up, I used the Smart Things app and it detected the new switch in five seconds flat. I assigned a room and programmed to come on when I walk the pups. Worked like a charm last night. Overall, the wiring on this was a cinch after my experience with wiring first one. All the challenges on this one was just getting it to fit.. The dude that wired four of these switches in a four gang box, you got to admire that.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Works great with ADT Pulse!,5.0 ,"This is a review of the GE 12722 Z-Wave on/off switch. I have the ADT Pulse system and this switch has installed and worked perfectly. The physical install is a breeze if you have at least a minimal knowledge of installing switches or outlets. The included instructions are pretty thorough, so if you take your time and follow them you should be fine. The primary issue I encountered was the pairing of the switch to my ADT system. I tried at least 10 times before finally getting it to work. 2 things to remember; 1) you do not need to have the switch near the base for pairing, 2) Push the switch button and release quickly...DO NOT HOLD. I found I was making a fairly common mistake based on other reviews I finally found on here. It seems that most people [like me] have a desire to push and hold the switch button when the ADT system is in learning mode, but that doesn't work. Do this: 1. Log in to your ADT Pulse Portal 2. Select system 3. Select Manage Devices 4. Click in the box showing switches, doors, thermostats, etc... 5. Click Add 6. Read instructions, click Continue, walk to switch, PUSH AND RELEASE QUICKLY. When you go back to your computer you should see the switch has been discovered with a screen displaying all of the device information. Some others have said they had to try up to 3-4 times, but all have had success with this method that I have found.

Good but not perfect,4.0 ,"Works well. The LED is on when the outlet is off (and it's a bright blue LED that is super-annoying at night in a bedroom), but that can be changed if you have a remote or a controller that can send very specific commands. I wish there was a way to program it from the pairing button itself (like a very long press). Other than that, it's a basic/standard GE outlet. The bottom outlet is the one controlled, the top one is always on. The twist connectors coming in the box are likely useless for you if you have more than one wire to connect to in the electricity box. So keep that in mind (get some bigger one based on the size and number of wires to connect together. Also DO NOT forget to buy a faceplate. The faceplates are not included (super cheap on Amazon, so Add-on items for prime. Better order all at the same time.

Good switch & some DIY installation tips,4.0 ,"Identical to GE switches in every way. Like all zwave switches, install is tricky due to space constraints. Includes perfectly with my Vera Lite in earlier firmware versions as well as the latest UI7 and is detected correctly as an on/off switch. To include, just press the switch with the Zwave controller very close by. These are wide switches, but they fit (just) side by side with standard building quality light switches in multi switch boxes. I would not recommend installing 2 of these in the same wall box, but feel free to try. I like the blue LED, which makes it easy to see at night. As they have a neutral, they work with LED and CFL, which turn 100% off when locally or remotely switched to off (unlike the dimmer version, where the LED lights are still at 50% and CFL's flicker as they have no neutral) Install REQUIRES a neutral wire, so make sure you have wire nuts and some extra 20 gauge jumper wire handy. I like the way these switches install, as they have actual contacts, rather than silly 22 gauge braided wire pigtails. The contacts support both push in wiring or you can make a loop and hook around the screw terminal as well. This makes it far easier to retrofit and you do not need extra wire nuts for line/load with the added benefit of requiring less space in an already crowded electrical box. Its likely you will need both jumper wire and 2 x wire nuts for neutral and earth though. The easiest install method (for single pole) is to cut a 7"" long white jumper wire for neutral and a 7"" bare copper wire for ground from some 3 core wire, stripping around 3/4"" from each end. Connect the white (neutral) to the existing bunch of neutral wires in the box by removing the existing wire nut & adding in your new jumper wire then replacing the wire nut. You may need to use a larger wire nut. Connect the ground the same way to the existing ground wire(s). You should now have the 2 original black wires from the standard builders switch (line & load) as well as 6"" long jumpers for neutral (white) and ground (bare copper) for a total of 4 wires coming out of your wall box. Connect all four wires to your new Jasco / GE switch as per the instructions on line/load/neutral/ground and it will work every time. Install for 2 way switches is the same extra work with the neutral wire, but you need 2 DIFFERENT models of Jasco/GE switches and they must be wired in a very specific order. Model 45609 is the main switch and the second switch is a special auxiliary model 45610, connected to each other via a traveler wire. The newbie mistake on these GE/Jasco Zwave switches (and I see a TON of them in opened packages at Lowest after being returned) is to miss the neutral wire, as the original builder switches don't have these. The neutral wire is needed to power the Zwave radio and the blue LED when the switch is in the ""OFF"" position.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

I am no electrician, but the instructions are so easy to follow that even a caveman can do it. Just remember to TURN OFF THE POWER from your BREAKER BOX BEFORE you decide to open the outlet up and start messing with wires. Product requires a NEUTRAL line (white wire) -- be sure you have this in your wall/electric box before disconnecting your old light switch.

Z Wave & Smartthings Success,4.0 ,"A few HOURS later, it works. My 3 way wiring was witchcraft and it took multiple tries to figure out what the heck was going on. Instructions in the box were worthless so Dr. Google was there to save they day as always. I successfully set up a 3 way switch using the toggle dimmer switch paired with the add-on toggle switch. Only problem I currently have is that my LED retrofit from FEIT buzz when dimmed any amount. The switch is silent, so I'm not sure what to do aside from swapping out recessed retrofit light until I find one that works? But I hear some switched work better than others when it comes to this issue. However, I typically find that a switch will buzz and not the fixture. Words of advice: 1) Use the provided short screws for the face plate mount. The original ones from my old switch were longer and when full screwed in, they somehow turn the bottom left/right toggle built-in in OFF. Odd behavior for sure but that's what it is...So there's a REASON they give you them and they are suspiciously shorter. 2) 3 way switch setups will REQUIRE one wire screw nut to tie together the black wires at the add-on switch, since that switch doesn't need them.

"THE FUTURE IS HERE, WELL A VERY SHORT PAIRING DISTANCE FUTURE.",4.0 ,"I am using two of these in my garage attic to turn the lights on automatically when you climb up the retractable stairs. They are connected to a SmartThings hub, and a Samsung motion sensor tells them to turn on when you climb up. Very easy to install with the supplied wire nuts. The only quirky thing is they have a very short range to do the initial connection with the hub. It even states that they have to be within 10 feet of the hub. Well that's easy for a device that is more mobile like a plug, but something that is hardwired you can't really wire up by the hub then wire up in your junction box. I had to bring an old WIFI extender up to the attic of the garage along with my Samsung Hub. Connect the extender to the network and LAN connect the Hub. Then go through the z-wave pairing on the smartphone. It worked great once the Hub was within that short range. So either you have to have these closer to a hub, have a super long LAN cable to bring your hub closer to the outlet, or do as I did. I love that the outlet has one always live plug.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Some Installation Tips And Descriptions,5.0 ,"I purchased this switch to work with my SmartThings hub. This being the first ""SmartThing"", it took a bit of research to install. The product looks great! The LED light at the bottom of the switch can be configured to always off, on when light is on, or on when light is off through the SmartThings app. It's nice to be able to turn the LED to always off for use in a bedroom. I have no experience wiring electrical outlets, but I took this on after watching the installation video a few times. It was pretty straight forward. I just copied the config from the old switch. It is VERY important to have that neutral wire attached. You CANNOT go without it. The switch will not work. There is a neutral wire included in the bottom of the box along with the extra ivory colored paddle. After install, I was a bit confused with getting the switch connected to the hub, but after a bit of research, found that you begin your search with the SmartThings hub and turn the switch on then off. Connected right up. Remember this. It's not stated in the paper directions very clearly. I found that fitting this switch into the box in the wall, the screw mount catches on the neutral wire connection. Since I have another switch to replace with a smart switch for this 2 gang box in the future, I'm unsure if this will interfere with the installation of the face plate cover. This switch can also be used as a 3-way switch and you do have to buy the the add on switch for the other end. The switches are stationary. They ""click"" when you press the on or off button. They do not ""flip"" like traditional paddle switches. The light switch OCD in me loves that because there isn't one switch in the ""on"" position and the other switch in the ""off"" position in a 3-way configuration. They all look the same! I'm looking very forward to completing my switch conversion and will be choosing this GE Z-Wave switches for the entire project.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Intermediate installation knowledge required - more advanced than typical switch replacement,4.0 ,"I would have rated this 4 stars, HOWEVER, installation was a bear for me. I'm just a basic handyman around the house and have installed many a replacement switch, however this one threw several curveballs. a) The marketing and product disclosure could have been more informative. If being used on a 3 way switch (i.e. 2 light switches, then you MUST also buy the ""Add On"" companion switch to replace the other switch that controls the same light. These should be sold as ""Z-wave control for one light switch circuit"" and Z-wave control for 2 light switches (3 way circuit). If using on a light with two switches, this system will only work if you replace BOTH (the primary Z-wave and the add on switch) - it's not a preference, it's a requirement. b) Next you have to figure out which switch box is the wired as the primary and which is the add on. I'm no electrician, but after about 12 hours of youtube based learning, resorted to using a multimeter. I had initially tried a pen / voltage detecter, but it was not able to differentiate between hot wires and cold wires (which I guess technically have a volt or two for carious reasons). With the multimeter (1 hour of youtube learning) I could easily see the hot wire vs cold wire when check each of the 4 combinations of on/off possible (ON/ON ON/OFF, OFF/ON OFF/OFF) among my two switches to determine which had a wire that was always HOT not matter what - this is the primary switch - directly connected to the fuse box. I learned that my primary was the opposite switch than I initially thought. Thank goodness it was within range of my Nexia router. Through additional tests I verified which wires were trailer 1 and 2 also necessary to continue the installation. Perhaps this would have ben quicker if I were an electrician. c) I was also thrown off by the neutral wire, but that was simple enough once I learned more about it. Simple enough. d) the Add on switch requires the installer to use a wire nut (not supplied) to merge the T1 and the Load wire (the one that goes out to the light). I would say I spent 6 hours with the main switch until I learned I needed the add on. After receiving that delivery a week later, I spent another 6 hours learning the wiring knowledge described in B, C and D above. I would say this install is not for rookies who are not able to spend time learning the concept of 3 way wiring and establishing a comfort level with which wire does what in their particular system. My house is only a couple years old and has fresh wiring and gang boxes that follow current city codes, yet most houses don't come with documentation explaining the electrical wiring schema! Once connected, I fired it up and shazaam - it worked great and easily connected to the Nexia. YAY!","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Better than TP Link,5.0 ,"This GE unit is the second brand in my smart home. The first was the TP Link switch. In my experience with this GE unit, I found the installation reasonably comparable to the TP Link unit to install. As a person with very little residential electrical knowledge, the instructions are a bit confusing but luckily the wires are color coded. I originally purchased the TP Link smart switch because it does not require a hub and it has a nice premium look to it. However, I found the TP switch to be frustrating unreliable as other reviewers have experienced. Perhaps I have a bad unit but for my particular unit the connection often cuts off and I'm forced to reset the switch to reconnect. This defeats the purpose of having a smart switch if its so unreliable that I have to walk to the switch to reset to remotely access it again. For the GE unit, a hub is required. So I have paired it to a Samsung Smartthing. So far I have found the connection to be reliable. There have not been a single instances when the light doesn't do what I ask using Alexa due to a bad connection. Another added benefit of being paired to Smartthing is being able to control all the various lights under different smart switches at once. TP link is noticeably missing from being compatible from Smartthings and therefore I cannot add it to a room or scene to control together. Despite the average design (it looks like any normal household light switch), I would go with the GE switch for its reliability and compatibility.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Exactly what I wanted.,5.0 ,"UPDATED REVIEW: I reached out to Jasco about the ramp rates not working as intended. I received a VERY informative response from the Project Managers. Apparently, the device was operating as designed. However, Jasco has since modified the existing firmware with a new parameter to allow you to adjust the behavior. I tested it on my dimmers and it worked as stated. Very happy with the product and Jasco Customer Service. Response from Jasco: Thank you for contacting Jasco Products Company. Here is the response from our Product Managers: We apologize for the amount of information we need to provide to accurately answer your question, but unfortunately there is some bad information being spread about what you are describing. First and foremost, the GE dimmers 12724 and 14294 do not require a patch or bug fix, as there is not a problem or incorrect behavior. Both units operate correctly as they were designed. All of our previous dimmers (including 12724) used to ramp slowly when being sent a level specific command (1-100). We then updated our 12724 product with enhancements that added additional routing options and to take advantage of the latest Z-Wave technology. When we did this, we had to upgrade the behavior of the dimmers to the latest spec as defined for Z-Wave certification. This new specification requires that when receiving a level specific command (1-100) the device is required to immediately jump to that level. · Any Z-Wave Classic Dimmer (including 12724) that has VER 3.0d and EARLIER on the back of the product will ramp slowly to the specific level when issued a level specific command. · Any Z-Wave Classic Dimmer (including 12724) that has “VER 3.0e” (This is the last version produced on our Z-Wave Classic products) on the back carries this new behavior · Any Z-Wave Plus Dimmer (including 14294), will carry this new behavior. Because this is a requirement for Z-Wave certification, the product must ship with the newest behavior as default. HOWEVER, understanding that our customers may want the previous behavior, we developed a new configurable parameter into our latest GE 14294 and Jasco 14321 In-Wall Smart Dimmer. · Dim Up/Down rate · Parameter Number: 6 · Size: 1 Byte · Valid Values: o 0 (Default) – New Required Behavior (Instantly move to level) o 1 – Ramp up and down slowly (3.0d and previous versions behavior) You can determine if the GE 14294/Jasco 14321 has this feature by verifying the manufacturer date code on the front of the Dimmer in the bottom right hand corner. It will be a small white sticker with 4 numbers. · The First 2 numbers are the Year it was Manufactured (example: 17 = 2017) · The Last 2 numbers are the Week it was Manufactured (example: 07 = 7th week 2017, or 3rd week of February 2017 Any GE 14294 manufactured ON OR AFTER 1651 will contain this new parameter 6 Any Jasco 14321 manufactured ON OR AFTER 1705 will contain this new parameter 6 ORIGINAL REVIEW: So this device (14294) was almost what I expected. Apparently, the dimmer does not ramp UP correctly when the command is issued via zwave. It jumps immediately to the set level regardless of the parameter settings. The only time the ramp rate works as designed is when going to 0%. Any other level jumps straight there. The ramp rates work correctly when issued from the switch itself however. Very disappointed. I'm still inside my return window and will likely send these back if I can't find out if a firmware update might correct this behavior.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Easy installation. Solid connection to Wink hub. Good ergonomics.,5.0 ,"I have 8 of these GE 12722 switches scattered throughout the house. I bought them after comparing to the Linear counterpart. The Linear was a cheaper construction, had side tabs that were hard to remove and that bent the metal can while trying, runs enough quiescent power to stay warm continuously, and doesn’t give a tactile feedback when switched when compared to the GE. This GE switch uses connection to the neutral line to enable an internal power supply. This means you don’t have to worry about the impedance of the load to provide “grounding” for the internal power supply, or the need for a dummy load if the impedance is too high. Since the internal power supply runs a relay, the switch can power most any type of device: incandescent lights, CFLs, LEDs, fans, etc. All the switches paired easily with my Wink hub. With the Wink’s hub recent software update, the switches reliably report their on/off status. I wired one in a 3-way configuration using the GE12723 companion auxiliary switch. The instructions would have had me with the master switch in the garage and the auxiliary switch (without a status light) inside. However, I wanted the status light inside, so I modified the suggested wiring, using the spare “traveler” wire to route the hot line to the indoor box. My only suggestion to GE would be to automatically dim the indicator light at night. It can be a bit bright when all the lights are off.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Had some issues with installtion,3.0 ,"I installed this switch in about an hour. I had two problems: 1. The wiring in my house is unconventional (or at least I think so) 2. Had issues pairing with the Wink Hub Even though I had neutrals, they weren't being used. On top of that the traveler wire was connected. I tried following the directions and simply connecting the neutral, load & line in the standard configuration, but the lights wouldn't work. I had to connect the load and the line wires to the LOAD connection and the traveler wire to the LINE (neutral & ground as usual). I included pictures. 2. I tried using the ""scan bar code"" in the Wink app in order to quickly pair the switch. However, I received the message ""This device is supported yet."" If it wasn't for the reviews (and Google), I would've thought I had made a bad purchase. When I was going through the pairing process, I kept getting the message ""This taking longer than usual. Would you like to retry or cancel."" After several times, I decided to go back to Mr Google for help. As I was searching, I so happen to grab my phone when I did I looked at the Wink app and noticed there was a new light icon. I tested the light and it worked as required. So my biggest issue with the device is that it didn't signal me to that the device was paired and the Wink app never gave me a success or looked as if it completed the process. However, after these hurdles, the device worked as expected. Oh as a few other ppl have stated, after I installed it, I was no longer able to use the face/trim plate. The manual slide at th bottom of the toggle prevents the plate from going back on.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Unreliable and difficult to install... but don't require a neutral wire,1.0 ,"I loathe and despise these switches. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, I'm stuck with them if I want a little bit of automation. Why? Because my house is old and has a lot of switch-loop wiring so, unless I want to rewire my house (nope), these are the only Z-wave compatible switches available in beige that don't require a neutral. (My other option is the now-defunct ActiveHome system, which I had and which worked perfectly for the past 15 years, but are now starting to behave erratically.) Barf. Why do I hate them? Let me count the ways. (Just two, really.) 1) They are soooo difficult to install. You insert the wire under the appropriate screw and then tighten it. Sounds easy, right? Nope. The screws kind of float until you tighten them. This isn't uncommon and wouldn't be a problem. Except that GE decided to bury the screws in a freakin' small trench. There isn't enough clearance between the screw & the plastic switch housing around it to just slip a wire around easily - you have to thread it from the opening on the back which, when gravity decides to do it's thang with the floaty screw... becomes an amazing exercise in frustration. Especially when... 2) The switches often don't work. I have 2 lights I need automated. TWO. I am now on switch number.... 5? 6? These things fail like dot.com startups. You fight through getting them wired up, turn on the power and... they don't work. If you look at these things wrong, they'll fuse open or closed and then it's game-over man. They're apparently very sensitive little ... ... devices and the slightest >anything< unusual just breaks them. I have 3 of these pieces of junk sitting on my table, representing about $120 of wasted money.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Very unreliable when sending status back to the hub,1.0 ,"I have a large Lutron Caseta installation at home, and I wanted to try some Z-Wave switches in my network for simple on/off loads. I bought eight of these switches to use with my Wink Hub 2, and installed two of them. They were in the next room from the hub, separated by perhaps ten feet of a drywall/wood stud wall. They paired fairly quickly with the Wink Hub 2, and could be controlled reasonably quickly when I pressed the icon on the Wink app or used Alexa, however feedback from the switch would take about 30 seconds - this would manifest in several ways, one of which was the Wink app not updating the change in status of the controlled light for that period of time, and the other, more troubling and what killed the deal for me - a Wink Robot that I created that would sense when the switch was turned on from the physical switch itself and then turn on another light would take 30 seconds for the other device to react. You can imagine what a horrible user experience this is. I tried several Z-Wave network commands such as rediscovering the network a few times, and resetting the complete network so I had to re-pair all my Z-Wave devices (only the two switches, so no big deal), but nothing seemed to help. I am uninstalling these two switches and returning all eight, I have exceeded my tolerance for trying to get what should be simple technology to work as advertised. I ordered four HomeSeer HS-WS100+ Z-Wave Plus Scene-Capable Wall Switch, Works with Amazon Alexa switches and will try those when they arrive. If I still get marginal bi-directional Z-Wave performance, I'm going to bail on Z-Wave light control (I'll still use it for sensors because the Wink Hub 2 works really well with Z-Wave sensors) and stick with Lutron Caseta switches.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"A Tad More Installation Work, But Worth It",5.0 ,"Pros: Connects to the neutral, wires connect to switch instead of dangling wires out the back, connects to z-wave network easily, works great Cons: Connecting the neutral is more work (but worth it), deeper dimensions than standard switches Overall: Installation requires a little more work than the older version, but it's worth it to avoid the downsides they had, and these switches work great. I've been using z-wave switches for awhile and most of mine were the previous version of GE/Jasco switches. This is definitely a step-up. Here's why... The older generation of switches were mainly designed for incandescent lights. In this system, you really didn't need to connect the neutral wire to the switch. The switch required a very low constant power supply to operate (it's never 100% off), this current would pass on to the lights and it would take the return path via the lights neutral wire. The problem is that with CFL and especially LED bulbs, this causes a flickering in dimmer switches when they brighten or dim, and can can cause LED bulbs to glow when the switch is off because just enough current is going through the line to activate them (it wasn't enough for incandescent bulbs to light up). By having a neutral connected to the switch, though, you don't have these problems since the low current isn't passed on to the lights when off. I also prefer the switches like this where you attach the wires directly to the switch and screw them tight instead of the type that has wires hanging out the back. I don't have to twist wires together and have wire nuts taking up room in the box where I'm usually pretty low on space anyway. The downside is that you might have some unexpected work to do in the switch box. If you start off with standard switches, the electrician most likely took all the neutral wires, twisted them together, and capped them off in the box. You'll have to run a jumper wire from the connected neutrals over to your switch. The box includes a jumper, but it may not be long enough for what you need, especially if you have a multi-gang box and the neutrals are twisted together on the opposite side of the box. I just took some Romex and cut out a length of white wire for the job. And, as others have noted, these switches are a little deeper than normal ones and you might have to do some wire cramming in the box to make everything fit. As for the z-wave, I connected it to my SmartThings hub with no problem and it works perfectly. All in all, I like these, they're better than the older variety in several different ways, and they're a good price for z-wave switches.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Good Product, None Have Failed",5.0 ,"Edit: I tried to review both the Add-on switch and the Z-wave switch, but Amazon keeps lumping them together. So, here is another go at it. First, both these do exactly what they are supposed to. I have a bunch of the switches and the Add-on switches and none have failed. In the original review I took off a star because because the screws are Philips head; household switches are supposed to have Robertson head screws...but really no big deal. The Add-on switches can be a bit hard to hook up at first, but they are simple. You just need a neutral wire (white) from anywhere and a traveller (non-current carrying) wire (usually red or black) back to the main GE Z-wave switch. For the traveller in a rewire, one can just use any wire that goes between the Add-on and the Z-wave switch, providing there is no electricity in it. The neat thing about the Add-ons is that one can have several of them, all in parallel, going back to the GE z-wave switch. So a single light or bank of lights could be controlled from two, three or more locations, providing you have or can install a traveller wire between all the additional Add-on switches. On one re-wiring I messed up and inadvertently had power on the traveller; I was sure I'd blow the switch or the Add-on as the instructions are clear that there should be no power on that terminal. So my surprise nothing blew up.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Perfect for adding voice control to Minka-Aire ceiling fans using Amazon Echo, VeraPlus, and BWS HA gateway.",4.0 ,"Our house has two Minka-Aire fans that had that company's wireless remotes. Certain unnamed family members will leave these fans on 24x7 in the summer whether they are at home or not, so I wanted a way to have them shut off automatically as well as voice control them with our Amazon Echo Dots (yes, I am the grumpy ""put on a sweater!"" thermostat nazi kind of guy). After a little research confirmed that our Minka-Aires were AC fans, this turned into a fairly straightforward install. The first step is to (turn off the appropriate home breaker or course) remove the cowling from the fans - that is the piece next to the ceiling that contains the wireless receiver. I could lower it to access the wiring, where I bypassed the receiver by just jumping white to white, black to black. (I left the receivers there, just bypassed them). I then replaced the Minka-Aire wall switches with this GE fan control (you need a neutral wire). Then you simply pair the switches with your home automation system - in my case a VeraPlus, which can pair Z-Wave switches from a great distance. Although the Vera now has direct Amazon Echo control (in beta), I'm personally using the BWS Systems free HA bridge as the interface between Alexa and home automation which gives you a lot of customization features. The GE fan controls show up as dimmable lamps in home automation, so after some experimentation I had an Alexa ""On"" command map to the medium fan speed at a dimmer level of 55. If we want high speed, we say ""Alexa, set family room fan to 100"" or ""Alexa, set family room fan to 20"" for low speed. It works great. Using the PLEG plugin for Vera I now use an existing alarm system motion sensor to turn the fan off automatically - if no motion is detected after a set period of time. If there is a false negative because no one is moving in the room, you just use your voice to turn the fan back on. It will pay for itself! (in maybe a decade) I would give the control 5 stars but having it appear as a dimmable switch seems like a bit of a Z-Wave compromise - it works fine, but I think could have been better implemented.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Outstanding end result with reliable performance.,5.0 ,"Works great with Vera Edge. Add it as generic z-wave device. great switch. be aware that it is a bit larger than a common switch and will require use of a neutral wire. It does come with a neutral jumper so you can wire it into a neutral pigtail/bundle with little effort. Also, use the supplied switch plate screws and not the screws which come with the switch plate itself - the supplied screws are shorter and essential. I made a small extension cord, used it to power the switches for pairing in close proximity to the Vera controller during pairing. I then disconnected the switches fro the short extension cord and installed them in their permanent locations.

"Quality Device, Difficult to Pair, Extremely Bright Light",5.0 ,"I just installed this receptacle in my kitchen to control the window unit air conditioner we have in there to give a boost to the central air when cooking. I am a master electrician, so the swap of the old receptacle for the new was a breeze. I also have my BS in computer science, but that early 90's degree gets me nowhere with today's computers and apps. After twenty minutes of trying to get this device to pair with my Wink Hub 2 and trying every device configuration in the ""Power"" category in the Wink app, I retreated here to the reviews, looking for someone who had tried to pair this device with a Wink Hub. I found Anastasia's review and she was correct. I paired with the outdoor ""GE Plug-In Outdoor Smart Switch"", it said the paring failed, I killed the app and restarted it and went to the ""Lights + Power"" control group and it showed up there as ""Switch"" with a light bulb icon. We'll see if this switched/controlled receptacle has the fortitude to run an 8000 BTU window unit A/C. As for the blue light on the front of the receptacle, its on when the bottom (controlled) portion of the receptacle is off, it goes off when the receptacle is on. I have mine installed low behind a cabinet and it isn't visible, so the light doesn't bother us. However, if this were installed elsewhere and the receptacle was not hidden the brightness of the light would be a problem, especially in a bedroom where blue light while sleeping, they are discovering is not a good thing.

Doesn't look the same as its mate,3.0 ,"This add-on switch functions as it should, there's no question about it. Wiring was straightforward and simple, and it worked immediately and easily to control a hardwired light from a second location. I knocked two stars off its rating for two separate issues, both of which would be an easy fix and grant a great deal more satisfaction with the product. Both of my negative criticisms of this device are because of its design. While you might think design is secondary to function, it is after all just a switch, whose function should be taken for granted as the very purpose of its existence, therefore design is key. The two issues I have are simple, and I imagine would be easily remedied in the manufacturing process. The problem is that this standalone switch is built to be compatible strictly with GE's smart [dimmer] switches GE Z-Wave Plus Wireless Smart Lighting Control Smart Switch, On/Off, In-Wall, Includes White & Light Almond Paddles, Works with Amazon Alexa, 14291 , but sadly it does not match the design or look of the switch its compatible to. I'm disappointed that at this price point it doesn't appear identically to its mate. The first and most obvious is that the GE's smart switches all have a blue LED in the bottom right of the switch's frame to help you easily locate the switch in the dark. This add-on switch does not have such an LED, therefore breaking up the continuity of a switch bank (I have it installed with two other smart switches) and causing a sort of ""asymmetry"". The second design flaw, likely a result of the omitted LED, is that the switch frame is not the same width, and therefore looks like a totally different brand. Perhaps it would not bother some people, but these subtle differences catch my eye from across the room and detract from its overall satisfaction.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

After the typical mumble and grumble I tend to have when installing these switches into my triple gangbox setup, I am relieved to find the blue light turns on, on the switch, and I am able to manually control the fan. The hard part was supposed to be over, but after attempting to pair the switch with my Wink Hub 2, I found that nothing I did would work. I tried Exclusion Mode, Inclusion Mode, restarting the Wink Hub 2, Resetting the switch, etc. but nothing I did allowed for it to work. My next step was to call Wink and figure out what may be happening. The representative told me that the device was pairing, but coming up as an ""unknown device."" No matter what we did it stilled showed up as such. Basically the device was useless. I called Jasco, the creator of the switches, and they informed me that it was compatible with Wink. However, the representative from Wink informed me that they believed the Wink logo was put on there erroneously, as he couldn't find any documentation on his end that would state the fan controller was a supported device. On top of that, the Jasco rep was very unhelpful and basically told me I had 2 defective switches. Which was wonderful, because I believed him and uninstalled the 2 switches and went back to get more. After installing only 1 of the 2 new ones, I found that, again, the device wasn't able to be paired. The new Jasco rep told me that it was strange that it wasn't working, and that Wink was a registered partner for these devices. He said I could talk to a product manager, but they wouldn't be able to resolve my issue, and it was out of their hands. Such a waste of time. TLDR version: The GE Z-Wave Plus Fan Controller does not work with the Wink Hub 2 as of 6/22/2017. It will pair, but as an unknown device, and only the Wink reps can see this. If you want a Z-Wave Fan controller by GE that works, buy the standard Z-Wave version as denoted by the model number 12730. I can confirm this product currently works with Wink Hub and Wink Hub 2.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
And whoever thought it was a good idea to put the ground screw right above the ...,3.0 ,"Installation was straightforward. Directions said to pair by pushing once. I could not get it to pair until I read a review that said push the top and then the bottom. It paired right away. BTW, to un-enroll, push twice. The screws were so tight I thought I was going to strip them just getting them to loosen. Be sure you have wire nuts a little larger than the original because the extra wires for neutral and ground are difficult to add with the original wire nuts. And whoever thought it was a good idea to put the ground screw right above the mounting screw must not have ever installed a light switch. The mounting screw was definitely in the way. Other units just use wire pigtails and honestly they are not that much harder to deal with. In fact a pigtail gives you extra wire to deal with though they do use a couple of extra wire nuts. Once installed it has been working well and my Vera Lite controls it just fine.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

It's already installed and it works well as a dumb switch so I'll leave it. Apparently the older version that's non plus does work with Home Assistant, but seems silly to purchase old technology.

"3 second delay with Wink 2, bulky size. But it works great.",4.0 ,"I have a pair of these to control my porch lights. They work great with Alexa and my Wink 2. There is about a 3 second delay in comparison to my other products that are near instant, but it's tolerable. These do require a neutral, so older wiring may be an issue. They are quite bulky, and that makes installation a pain if the electrician wired things up like a monkey with a huge rat nest of wires in the box. I ran into a slight issue in a steel dual gang box due to width. It barely fit, but I was not able to push the switch to the side to get the wall plate to line up properly. It wasn't an issue with drywall overhang, but with the width of the steel gang itself just being too narrow by about 2mm. I managed to make it work, but the wall plate screws ended up at a slight angle. That being said, I do like the device and will be getting more. They aren't perfect, but they do the job well enough.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works with Smartthings. No problems so far.,4.0 ,"I bought a Samsung Smartthings hub and have been replacing switches throughout the house. I bought this specifically to work with a celing fan with light, along with their fan control (for some reason no company had a combined fan/light control) installed in a 2 gang box. It works with my Smartthings hub seamlessly, and if we move it will function as a 'normal' switch for the next homeowner. I knocked off 1 star, the switch has captive screws for the wire hookups that are intentionally loose. If anyone has wired up a normal switch the screws will stay put when backed out. This makes it a little harder to wire up, but not impossible.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"No problems with switches, dimmers or ceiling fans. All were found by Vera Edge immediately and easy to setup.",4.0 ,"Alright, I really enjoy what these switches do, but I am not a fan of installation. The back of the items are rather bulky so ramming them back into the box gets tough, but what is really annoying is that there is either no tension or no spring loading on the screws so if you have to do a class wire wrap instead of inserting into the straight connector you're going to bang your head having to wrestle with the screws to get a wire loop in there. Other than the install, they have all worked well. I have dimmers, which seem to go in 1% increments via my Vera edge, i have 8 or so on-off switches and recently started using the ceiling fan switches. All work really well functionalliy, just -1 star for the install. Maybe the bulk is shielding or something but you would think in this day and age the device could have been a bit less bulky. it's almost guaranteed you will want to break off the butterfly wings on both sides if you have more than 1 switch per gang. I'd do that before wiring them in. Once i had enough of these scattered through the house i was able to add more zwave devices without having to move my vera edge around. It is addicting to have these. Next steps will be to incorporate motion sensors into scenes.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Great Z-Wave switch. But doesn’t update controller when manually operated.,4.0 ,"A great Z-wave switch. Easy enrollment in my network. Stays enrolled. Easy control. Dimming works well with the bulbs I’ve used so far. I’d have rated it a 5 except it does not update the controller when operated manually (I.e., at the switch). So it requires polling by the controller (a program you write) to make sure it has the correct status. Not a big deal but eats up some cpu cycles. The documentation does mention this.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Simple & easy to use with SmartThings,5.0 ,"Great zwave switch here. You will need a zwave controller to use the wireless features. At the $35-$40 price point I won't be replacing many switches, but I wanted one to control my outdoor lighting. The outdoor lighting is fluorescent tubes, so one of the few fixtures I don't have smart bulbs for. It was very easy to install, but just barely fit into the single gang box after I removed the old switch. Shut off your circuit breaker first of course. I found a black and white wire only, screwed those in. I had connected the included small neutral wire to the switch, but that's not connected to anything in the wall. Smartthings detected it quickly without any issues. My wife didn't like the blue led indicator so I easily turned it off from the smart things app. There were also options to have the led indicator on when the switch was either on or off. It's really been great to set the light on my patio to come on automatically. Helps keep my dog from getting anxious in the dark and makes it look like somebody is home. The best part is if I hear a suspicious noise or something outside I can turn the light on from my phone or tablet. Lets me light up the backyard very quickly. Update: After several months of use this switch is still working perfectly. I have had absolutely no compatibility issues with smart things. I set the automatic timer in the smart things app to turn this light on and off and it's worked brilliantly.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works Like a Champ with Smartthings,5.0 ,"Works Like champ. One Caveat however... This is easy to wire, but if you are replacing a single pole switch going to a light, you MUST still connect the neutral wire (white) to another White wire, even if you are replacing a simple inline switch. Smart things found it effortlessly. Nice feature is that... through smartthings, you can set the function of the Blue LED light on the switch. ON means light is on (so you know by looking if your outdoor lights are on for example)... or ... On means light is off (so you can find switch in the dark)... or ... no light whatsoever (which is not near as cool). Function - Basic rocker switch style. Switch stays in middle position. Push top... and a solid click will turn on the light. Push Bottom, and a solid click will turn off the light.

Nice with ONE note to be aware of.,4.0 ,"It's a Zwave enabled on/off Decora-style switch and it works. There are both dimmer and switch versions of this unit -- the newer series (12xxx series) work fine with dimmable LEDs; I've seen reports that the older ones do not. There is one thing to be aware of - these do not support the association command class, which means you cannot tell your controller to notify it if you locally change the switch (with the paddle.) Most gateways poll for state but there's a delay before the update is recognized. Leviton's switches, for example, do support this and as such you get instant notification for local changes. Does this matter to you? It might. For most people it probably doesn't but if you wish to ""gang"" things off local control (e.g. you turn on the lights using this switch, your controller sees that as a trigger and turns on three other things) then this limitation suddenly becomes a very material and impossible to solve problem. As long as you're ok with this limitation I like these a lot. They look and feel like standard Decora switches where most others in the marketplace do not, which is IMHO a big plus. Note: Config Parameter 4 sets whether pressing the TOP paddle (as shown in the picture) turns the load ON or OFF. Default is zero, and on. Setting it to ""1"" flips the paddles so the TOP paddle turns the load OFF and vice-versa. Config value ""3"" sets the LED -- zero (default) sets the LED on when the load is OFF and vice-versa, while ""1"" sets the LED to follow the load (on = on, off = off.)","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Works great with Smartthings and Alexa!!!,5.0 ,Installed this in about 10 minutes after rearranging some wires in the gang box so I could install the neutral wire. The switch appears to only support the wire being inserted from the rear instead of a standard screw wrap; narrow depth gang boxes will probably be an issue with anyone that has 2x3 studs. The ground lug is also strangely at the very top of the outlet.. The switch operation is strange because it does not travel like a standard switch and always stays in a 0 position; it just takes some getting used to.

"Great when they work, have had to replace many over the year they have been installed",1.0 ,"Not really sure how to rate these, they are great when they work, however I've had to replace 4 of them on occasions where we have had a power outage; and they are getting expensive to replace. Once the power comes back on, they click on and off constantly and never work again (have had them installed for about a year and every time we lose power it seems one switch goes bad). I figured the first one went bad because I didn't have a surge protector installed, got one installed and have lost 2 more since then. (I installed them all over my entire house along with some of the dimmers when we remodeled our home). Also, I don't think its the same thing, but another switch still works manually, but will not work anymore with smart things (smart things detects that its on and off I just can't control it from the hub).

Details on Alarm.com & finding the neutral wire,5.0 ,"There are two aspects of installing this system. 1) configuring your Z-Wave system and 2) basic switch wiring. 1) Z-Wave: My alarm system includes an Alarm.com module that acts as a Z-Wave controller. In advance of buying these light switches, I called my alarm company and specifically requested that they enable lights, locks, thermostats, etc. It did not cost any extra. Before starting the installation, I logged into the Alarm.com web interface and made sure I saw a message like this. ""Your service plan includes Light Automation, but it doesn't look like you have any light devices."" That helped me realize that the system was ready for the install. 2) Wiring: I installed two Z-Wave switches into a three-gang wall plate. The two Z-Wave switches now control the exterior lights, turning them on at sunset. I didn't want to bother paying extra to automate an interior light. My modern house (built in the last few years) included three wires already attached to the old switches: a copper ground wire, a black line (hot) wire and a black load wire. These were simple on-and-off switches, not three-way switches. Tucked away inside the three-gang wall plate was a bundle of white neutral wires inside a screw cap. Working with the neutral wires was the hardest part of the installation for a non-electrician. I went to a big box store and bought 15 feet of Romex 14-guage wire for around 7 bucks. The Romex included a black and white wire, plus a ground. I just wanted two 8-inch lengths of the white wire. I stripped the ends of each 8-inch white wire to turn it into a ""pigtail"" lead that went to the big bundle of white neutral wires. (I also bought a larger wire nut at the big box store.) My non-contact voltage tester helped me differentiate the line (hot) wire from the load wire. In my installation, both were black, but the hot wire is the one that beeps when you put a voltage tester near it. Also, it provided some extra peace of mind. If you turn off the circuit breaker, you're pretty safe, but I ran back and forth to the breaker box a bunch of times, trying to figure out the wires. If I placed the voltage tester near the wires and did not hear any beeps, I felt more comfortable reaching in there. Here's the voltage tester on Amazon.

Works perfectly with dimmer but requires some electrical rewiring in the box...,5.0 ,"Wiring this accessory switch was weird because it is the opposite of the way a traditional three way switch is installed. You usually have the traveller and the hot going through the switch and the neutral is just connected directly to the load. But not this accessory switch, it is actually the opposite. You still connect the traveller through the switch but this is the neutral that you connect to the switch the hot goes straight to the load. Because of that, it means that you have to identify which of the two switches is the one going to the load before you can replace them. The main switch and the accessory are not interchangeable from an electrical point of view. TLDR: If you are replacing an existing switch, be ready to have some slight rewiring in the box to do. Nothing too difficult but needs some attention. Also, you have to make sure that you have disconnected the both existing switches before doing the installation or you might send hot into the accessory dimmer and that's not good. The documentation is pretty good and easily to follow, just make sure to read it before tackling the install.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
100% Wink Hub Compatible.,5.0 ,"Work 100% of the time with the Wink Hub. You MUST have a neutral wire to use this. Most switches don't have a neutral hooked up, but will have a bundle of 3 or 4 white wires in the back of your box. Typically these are all neutrals, and you just need to get a small piece of wire to tap into the neutrals with a wire nut, then run it into this switch. Very easy to install, first one took around 15 min. can do them in less then 5 now. Have used this with CFL and LED lights they work great because this switch does not dim. No humming or buzzing or anything like that. There is a nice blue LED light on the front of this switch that is ON when the light is OFF. It's nice so you can see the switch easily in the dark. I hear this can be changed with different hubs (LED off when light is on), but not the Wink Hub FYI. It's not a super bright LED light anyway.

"Annoying to pack into electrical box, but works well and appears reliable",4.0 ,"Installed pretty easily, though as is true with similar products from every vendor I have dealt with, it is takes up a lot of room in the box, meaning you have to cram the wires into a very tight space. My guess is that installing two of them into a 2-gang box would be even more painful. Functionally, it has given us no problems, though it took me a couple of go-arounds as a user to prove to myself that it was acting as expected. I wish it was cheaper, I wish you could replace just one of the switches and leave the other 3-way or 4-ways in place rather than having to buy the add-on, but so far that hasn't become available with any vendor.

Once paired its worked fine (about 4 months),3.0 ,"I had a difficult time pairing this switch with my VeraLite controller. I tried various combinations of button presses and power cycles for about an hour, until it finally paired. Once paired its worked fine (about 4 months). The thing I dislike the most is that the flange around the switch is very thick. This causes it to protrude out of the outlet box further than a standard switch. If you have a double gang box with another switch, this one will stick out further and the wall plate will no longer fit correctly. You'll need to either figure out a way to recess this switch (removing about 0.125"" of drywall) or bring the standard switch forward with some spacers. The later option may result in a gap between the back of the wall plate and the wall itself.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Almost perfect.,4.0 ,"Pros: Good feel. No buzz. Clear instructions. Comes with a jumper wire to bring neutral wire to the box. Simple, re-usable straight-in connectors. On button restores to the last dim level with soft on-ramp. Off button gradually dims to turn off. Blue LED light can be programmed to be always off, or (best IMHO) only on when the light is on (default: blue light is on when the light is off). Works well with the Add-On switch. Cons: Switch is deep (can be hard to fit into the box with all the wiring). Metal tabs on the sides need to be broken off to fit next to others in the multi-gang box. (Manual does allow for this; you have to wiggle them off with pliers.) No way to quickly reach 100% brightness at switch. (There is no double tap option for full on.) The metal 'face' is a bit thicker than most older switches (e.g. Lutron) which makes the switch and mounting screws stick out a small bit (1mm?) compared to others in the same box.

I highly recommend these switches!,5.0 ,"Finally, a light switch that looks and fits my old designer faceplates and actually works without having to install a module behind the light switch itself. Some people have said these are large, and yes, compared to a standard light switch they are, but they're the same size as those large toggle switches and more convenient than those zwave modules you have to try and cram behind a standard switch--which is a herculean feat. I bought two to replace a double gang light switch box and at first--positioning them on the inside of the faceplate I was using, they did not fit. The tabs made them too wide. The instructions clearly showed me how to bend and remove the little tabs and after that they were golden. After installing with pigtails so I could see if they would work before I closed it all up--this is not my first rodeo, so working with live circuits isn't something I'd recommend for most people, besides, it freaking hurts and is the oddest feeling when your fingers are pulsating under that momentary electrical contact--it's a real wake me up :) Anyways, after connecting the loads and traveler wires, nothing worked. So they had to be 3 way switches and Jasco is very nice to include a white wire with each unit. Connected those and both were working great. It's a tight fit back into that switch box, but not impossible. Adding them to my Veralite was easy and they work perfectly. There is an audible click when you toggle the light on and off, and I didn't like that at first, but I've grown used to it. Now with my iPhone and Homewave, I can control both lights with my scenes, etc...it's a real relief to know if I've left my lights on after leaving the house I can turn them off, or if I'm late coming back home, I can turn them on to dissuade any would be burglars out there.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
GE 1000w Z-wave dimmer #12725,5.0 ,"So there appears to be a lot of miss understanding about the GE Z-wave dimmer products. Hope this helps. Model #12725 (1000 watts max) doesn't require a neutral (white) wire but only works with the older incandescent lights. Model #12724 (600 watts) requires a neutral wire but works with all bulbs including the newer CFL &LEDs. GE has has only one type of add-on switch #12723 (3 & 4 way) for all it's switces which does require a neutral wire to provide power. Even when using with #12725. Note: This is a cheat that I did (not totally proper). I hooked up the master dimmer #12725 as per diagram but I used a extra wire from the ground to neutral post of the add-on. Grounds and neutrals go to the same place in breaker box. I wouldn't recommend this for any master dimmers but the add-on doesn't handle any high voltages and requires the low power flowing through the neutral/ground to power it. So far these have worked great. I would have liked a little light scale down the side to know % of brightness but then that would make them standard out more. I really like the little blue light to help you find them in the dark. I needed the #12725 because even though my house is newer and has neutrals everywhere, they wire 3 & 4 way switches all crazy different ways. My kitchen happen to have the line & load from the overhead light in the same two wire bundle. 🤔 Small note: The removable tabs on the sides are heat sinks. You can remove them to help fit multiple switches in a box but each time you do you lower the wattage rating. Remove one side and the #12725 goes from 1000 watts to 800 watts. Remove both sides and it drops to 600 watts. I heard one person complain about having to wire dimmer master and add-on together. Suggested a more remote type of add-on. I disagree. I chose these GE switches for my 3-way kitchen lights because they will continue to work independent of a hub or if the Z-wave part isn't working.

At the point where it asks you to turn the switch on just press the button on the outlet. It will sync up and you are ready to go. The installation was really easy. Easier than rewiring a normal outlet. If I have any other outlets I want to connect via wink I'll probably buy another one.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Wonderfully Convenient!,5.0 ,"First and foremost... I have ADVISE for those having installation issues. I'm not an electrician so more details instructions would have been helpful. I bought this light to replace an existing [regular] switch, for our porch light, so I knew the wires were all good. My neutral/white wires were bundled together and stuck in the back of the switch box. I pulled out 1 neutral wire, as is shown on the instructions, and connected it to the switch. Turned on the breaker back on and the blue LED on the switch lit up, but I could not manually switch on the light. I was stumped! After a few hours of research via Google, I finally found the solution. You NEED to KEEP all the NEUTRAL wires in the switch box bundled TOGETHER and simply add the neutral wire from the switch to the bundle. Now the light works like a charm. I've successfully paired and am using this switch with our Honeywell Lynx Touch system (with Z-Wave module). Using the Total Connect app, I was able to program our porch light to come on at sunset and turn off a few hours later. If necessary, we can still manually switch the light on/off as needed. Awesome switch that I highly recommend for anyone with a Z-Wave controller.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Misrepresentation of product, you need a hub to operate!",1.0 ,"I installed several of these switches into my new home. I have also installed 2 wireless security cameras, a nest, and 2 honeywell wifi thermostats. All of the latter were a breeze to install, but not the light switches. I don't mean the physical installation into the wall. I mean actually getting them to work through your phone. After wasting two hours online trying to figure out how to get the right app configured on my phone, I finally figured out I need a hub to get these switches to work (by reading frequently asked questions on Amazon). Why? I didn't need a hub for my other 5 wifi operated products, why do I need to spend an additional $100 on a hub for these stupid light switches. There is nothing in the box, in the manual or online that says these lights only work through a hub.

Very very annoying.,3.0 ,"I bought 5 GE on/off switches. Linked to Smartthings and Alexa. No issue connecting. If you're having trouble, try repeatedly turning the switch on and off while pairing. It worked for me instantly. All my devices were discover in 10 seconds. They work flawlessly with SmartThings. My issue is how they work with Alexa. I'm not sure what the problem is. Alexa can always turn switches off(every single time). But it doesn't always turn them on. Rarely it turns on right away, many times I have to ask twice, more often it doesn turn switches on at all. When I manially turn switch on, and ask Alexa to turn off, it works. Then if I ask Alexa to turn it back on, it usually takes one or two asks but the switch will turn on. Very very annoying.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Great switch! **But need Utube instructions for installation**,5.0 ,"Had to add on to enable the GE Bluetooth Smart Switch (13869) I bought to work with the 3 way outlet. Using it to control the lights on the house. Initially I unpacked the 13869 and tried to wing it without instructions. After quite a bit of frustration realized this add on switch was needed for the switch to function. So that was a bit irritating since it wasn't clear on the original packaging. So I ordered one on Amazon since no stores in town carried the add on switch. Second frustration was the wiring. The instructions are pretty horrible. I tried without the instuctions. Fail. I tried with instructions. Fail. Then I got on U-tube and followed step by step and worked perfectly. definitely not an intuitive install you can wing without guidance. But the product, one installed after all the headaches works flawlessly, at least on day 2. The app is pretty self explanatory.

annoying,2.0 ,"I find the rocker-switch mechanism annoying to use. Additionally, the switch does not respond immediately like a normal switch, even when you're pressing on it manually with your hand. Finally, it takes about 3-4x the tactile force of the usual wall switch to activate when pressing. I prefer the lighter touch of normal switches. one very major praise: you don't have to recognize current switch state in order to flip it, which is easier [up is on, down is off, always] both for normal operation, and for when you have multiple switches controlling the same light. I didn't think of this benefit until writing this review: I'll think some more about it, but the activation-pressure is a significant design flaw.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Nice tactile feel - but...,4.0 ,"These work well. However... There are range limitations, even in our little home. We need to keep our ZWave controller within 40 ft of our switches or they can hang and stutter when commanded. Also if the distance is over 50 ft or so, the status read back from the switch can take three to four times longer to be reported properly. There is also a noticeable delay between the time you press the switch and when the light actually comes on. I perceive it to be around 1/3 of a second delay. Which is just long enough for you to wonder if you need to press it a second time. But they have a nice positive feel. The is a perceivable ""click"" even to the touch when they are pressed. The tactile feedback is VERY welcome. We used X10 switches for years, although the X10 switches work reliably, they had a very spongy, cheap feel. But these have a solid, qualit feel to them! :-)","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

"Works well, very poorly constructed for the price",3.0 ,"I bought this from Discount Home Automation as it was significantly cheaper there. Am very disappointed with the quality of this switch. I'm using this with SmartThings home automation and here's the plus and minus: 1. Compatibility - 10/10 - Works perfectly, paired out of the box, push the switch up to start the pairing process 2. Functionality - 5/10 - for the price, it should have other features which other switches support such as an indicator light which can be programmed via SmartThings 3. Quality/Design - 2/10 - VERY poor build quality/design for the HEFTY price. First of all this is a BIG switch and takes up almost the whole box when using in conjunction with other switches in the same you may run out of space. The switch button that sticks out is VERY long, much longer than the standard switches, it looks very odd a long narrowing piece of plastic sticking horizontally out of the plate (it's doesn't angle and is perpendicular to the plate, it just moves 1 mm up/down to switch on / off). Also the screw holes for the face plate are poorly constructed. A standard size screw didn't fit and got jammed and eventually it snapped off inside the switch while trying to tighten it. I expected much better build quality for this price. End result, it works, but I'll switch to another brand as soon other options are available. It looks very funny sticking out of my face plate.

Switch works and pairs easily with SmartThings,4.0 ,"Great switch, paired very easily with the hub, once it was within range of it. Only negative I will say (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that while I was playing with the screw to tighten the grounding wire, the screw broke off, leaving half in the switch, and half that wouldn't screw into anything anymore. I managed to push the switch back into the box in a way that pressure was holding the ground wire in its place, but a bit bummed that it broke almost straight out of the box. Other than that, the switch works beautifully, and paired with no problems. Makes a bit of a loud click sound when you turn it on and off via the smartthings app, but that is not a serious complaint and is easily overpowered by some background music or conversation. Will be buying more of these for sure","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Needs a little know how to set up,5.0 ,"I wanted to explain a couple of things to those who plan on self installing. I felt pretty confident having done some electrical work in the past. I got a little stuck for a moment on this though. It CAN operate as a regular 2 way switch just fine. Or 3 way or 4 way if desired. Someone said it cant do 2 way and thats not true. It does require a neutral, I knew that going in. My house was wired with them so I purchased with confidence. You can check by opening a switch box and checking to see if you find a bundle of white wires tied together. If you do - then thats your neutral. When you go to install youll find black wires bundled together too, those are your power wires, or ""live"" or ""hot"" depending on who you ask. When you replace a switch youll see that the ""hot"" bundle has a wire going to your switch, and another black wire that runs out to the light fitting - thats called the load, remember which is which. Now when you go to install the new switch youll need to remember the ""live"" and the ""load"" and install into the new switch as labelled. However youll also need to add a neutral and this is where I went wrong. I assumed I should unbundle the white neutral from the ""load"" and use it. When things didnt work I realized that was dumb because now my lights had no neutral. Rather than try to figure out which neutrals came from the power side and which ones came from the light fittings I just added another piece of white wire from some spare romex and that way I knew it would work when plugged in to the switch. So I guess a word of caution that youll need a faceplate (use the ones designed for the bigger switches - they fit perfectly) but if installing into a dual gang box - if you have fans or other switches, you could find it hard to identify the right wires to use. So take your time use an extra piece of white wire into the neutral bundle if needed. If you dont have neutral wires in your boxes then youll need to either use a different kind of z wave switch (which wont work well with LED or CFL bulbs) or youll need to fish some wire down to the wall with a neutral.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Delay when using switch manually // Strange functionality,1.0 ,Unfortunately this switch by GE is a total miss. The actual mechanical functionality returns to a 'Half On/Half Off' position after every use ... which is strange and difficult to use but even more annoying is the delay to turn the lights on when manually pressing the switch.

The box I originally wanted to install this in was a 2 gang but older metal style. The box was two single boxes that linked together. There was an indent at top and bottom of the box where the two boxes come together. It was just enough in the way that the dimmer wouldn't slide in.

"11 days for free shipping really???? hard to install at first, once installed good switch, forget tech support",1.0 ,"Buy at Lowes like I did, why wait for 11 days for Amazon free shipping. Please like my review, really want people to know the switch works, it is just all four wires are needed, not three like the old switches. And want people to know Amazon free shipping is very very long. I remember the days of free 3 or 4 days to get items. The switch itself is a little confusing to install and GE does not really explain the difference between the old on-off switch and this one. Very simple, and makes sense is the unit needs power to run the electronics. So you need the extra neutral wire that is included and MUST be added, that's the short white wire. Without that wire the switch has no power and will not work. So, add the white wire to neutral, the power, black wire goes to line, and the red or black load, wire to light, goes in load. ground is always ground and you should be all set. Tech Support to ask about pairing was a waste of time, as they said they don't help with that. I guess tech support means we answer the phone to tell you we can't help. A recording would have been the same. Home Depot was funny too, I asked where the z-wave switches were and they did not know they carried z-wave, or what it was. At least the direct z-wave support 800 number knew they sold z-wave, were no help but knew they had a job and it existed. The Home Depot guy was funnier. It paired fine while I spoke to tech support about why they did not know how to pair. On the plus side, switch paired no problem, VeraPlus controlled one floor away, the wires fit perfect in the holes provided, and tighten up very easy. the ground wire screw is in a bad place as it just barely fit in the wall, I did not file down the plastic, but that was an option if needed. Another reviewer commented the switch sticks out, not sure what they expect from an electronic switch, it needs to tootle up or down depending on its state, makes perfect sense. As to the unit is larger than the simple on-off switch, well it is a power computer in there, maybe one day they will be smaller, but really, what do you expect ?? As to build quality, it is fine, except for the placement of the ground screw the quality is fine. As to little blue lights, they are a plus or minus, my old swich was not lighted, so not a big deal, would like to have it and be able to turn it off, my wife does not light lighted switches. It's a personal choice, I lie them, she does not, only on basement light has a lighted switch, it is my basement, the rest of the house is hers, so no lighted switches. Need one more switch, and will but this again, the second time should be a breeze, might even try a three switch hall light, well maybe next year, after I rest up from the first one. I ordered three z-wave items, got tired after five days that Amazon did not ship yet so between Home Depot and Lowes got an Outlet and Switch. Home Depot Outlet installed just like the non-z-wave outlet it replaced and worked right away. Next day I did the switch from Lowes, had a little trouble because of the wire that I did not understand the first day, got it all figured out the second day so now two days of everything working. Tomorrow Amazon will deliver my order, 11 days after I ordered. Much easier to stop at Home Depot or Lowes for z-wave, will order from Amazon less and less as they streach free shipping to 7 day hold then ship trying to force PRIME on me. Between Netflix, Comcast, and Fios, not sure I need MORE channels. The PRIME shipping is great, but to try and stall shipping to force it is just driving me to other web sites or to stop at a store.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Often loses connection from my controller; controller will send on/off signal and will say it wasn't successful, but it was, then it will be reporting that it is on when in fact the outlet is off. I've got a mesh network and another zwave device not more than 5 feet away from this outlet that works without issue. Very, very frustrating, especially for the cost of this thing.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Plays nice with Smartthings,5.0 ,"I bought the Lowes branded version and it works great with Smartthings. I was a bit concerned about the instant status that the cheaper z-wave devices don't provide (i.e. software can get out of sync because manual operation of the switch isn't reported back to controller). Smartthings is doing some wizardry to allow instant (or near instant) status. I believe I read that this only works if the switch is in direct communication with the hub, rather than routed through the mesh. I'll have to buy some more and see what the results are. At any rate, the experience so far is much better than the Wemos with Smartthings.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Surprisingly easy to install and link to Wink.,5.0 ,"I bought two of this from Lowes at $39 each. They were easy to install and setup. I just followed the instructions that was included.

After 30 minutes I was able to install the 2 switches. Now it's time to link it to my Wink hub. Here's the tricky thing. This switch cannot be found in the Wink list. But you can set it up using the-- Lights> In-Wall Switch> Leviton. Follow the instructions on your app. When the Wink Hub is blinking, press down (off) on the switch, then up (on).

But how do they work?,5.0 ,"I have not yet used the z-wave capabilities of these switches yet; I will update this review after I have. I had some concerns about their operation prior to purchase, so I would like to share information I was unable to find elsewhere. The switches give a satisfying click when pushed up or down. A quick click up is on, a quick click down is off. They default to a fade in and out of around 1-2 seconds. They turn on to the same dim level at which they were previously turned off. Holding the switch up from an off position will fade up from off until released. The add-on switch acts just like the dimmer it is connected to. The fade and dim is a little choppy; there are noticable levels on the way up and down, but not enough to annoy me. They dim my Philips Warm Glow LED bulbs (A19, B30, and wide base candelabra) down to almost nothing. They will not turn my lights back on at a very low dim level, and must be dimmed back up from off when at a low dim level. Overall, so far very satisfied with these dimmers.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
"Easy to use, very functional.",5.0 ,I love this z-wave power receptacle. There are two outlets but only one is z-wave controlled. The other is always on. I have mostly purchased Leviton but this one is way more cost effective and has a nice button and blue light on it to let you manually turn on the one z-wave controlled outlet. There is a blue light that is on when the Z-wave outlet is off. This light is quite bright. It can almost be used as a night light. I have taken to covering it up with a little white sticker to dim it since one of these are right next to my bed.

Perfect for situations like mine (no neutral wire available). Here is a tip I found useful when using this with an older ceiling fan that has a light.

Huge disappointment!,1.0 ,"Just finished installing two of these switches. The functionality is fine and they are operating normally. However, GE apparently never tested having two in the same wall box. It is very common in a house to have two even three switches in a wall box. I got everything hooked up only to find that when I screwed the switches in the box, they overlapped each other. Now I have two switches that will not sit flush next to each other and can't put the wall plate on. Nice design flaw GE - apparently you can't live up to your name (General Electric) since a wall switch is a very general use electric device.

great regular-UI switch for your smarter home.,5.0 ,"i had competing goals for my automation project: (1) be able to control certain lights from outside the house/over the internet, as well as automating certain processes (lights on upon arrival, etc.) (2) have an as-near-as-possible ""old school"" experience for people using the physical switches inside the house. this review deals only with the second goal, since the first goal is accomplished with the ""brain"" of the system, the hub (smartthings, in my case). as far as a switch goes, this is great! it works just as expected -- as a rocker switch, except that it is actually a momentary switch, meaning that it does not stay in the position that you put it in, but returns to its ""neutral"" position at all times. this is actually great for 3-way applications, as you always hit the upper paddle to turn it on and the lower one to turn it off (unlike with a regular 3-way switch, in which the paddle you have to hit depends on the status of the other switch). this and the linear brand of switches are the only ones i have found that appear to have this configuration, and as this is the norm we're all used to, this is great, since i don't have to explain to my in-laws how to work the switches in my house. the tactile ""click"" feedback is perfect -- it feels just like a regular decora-style switch, so no one should be confused by it. there is almost no delay between hitting the light switch and having the lights come on, and this is with LED bulbs which are sometimes finicky to begin with. there is a barely audible click of the relay when the switch is triggered either locally or remotely, so if you are a light sleeper, perhaps don't stick it near your bed if you expect it to be triggered on/off remotely while you sleep. installation was a breeze, that is assuming you can install a regular light switch. it's actually easier to install in a 3-way configuration, because you don't need to worry about common terminals; just one traveler wire between the two switches. installation does require a neutral (not ground) wire inside your junction box, but it is incredibly rare to have ""power-through-light"" configurations that do not send the neutral down to the switch from the light. don't know what you'd have to do in one of those cases, as i haven't run into it yet.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY
Works Perfectly!,5.0 ,"The ge jasco zwave plus line of smart home products shows why ge jasco is truly an industry leader. This fan switch is an evolutionary product compared to the regular zwave option, with improved speed, range and processing power. The fan switch acts like a dimmer, holding up or down to go to any of the 3 speed levels. We couldn't find a way to turn off blue LED completely, however with a quick google search, Tapping the on button 3 times, then the off button once, will do the trick to toggle on when off, or off when on. It would be great if the zwave command parameter 3 byte 1, value 3 would work, but no luck. And that's litterly the only thing we found an issue with. That being said, this is hands down the best option for zwave plus fan switches out there! Sleek and clean and additional available colors in faceplates to match any decore style. We tested with wink, smarthings and vera and setup and use was fun and easy. See attached photo of how the interface works in samsung smartthings. Zwave plus is litterly so fast with this product that press ON the app would turn on before your figure left the screen! An important note, this switch cannot control lights on a fan, like the unreleased zigbee remote and module from hunter Bay can. However since our fans didn't have lights this was truly a beautiful fit. The ge jasco zwave plus line of decora style rocker dimmers and switches blend in to any home or business cleanly and simply. We experienced no problems or issues with usability or operations. In the below photo we used a lutron claro wall plate for extra clean lines and simplicity. If you just getting into smart home this is a great start.

Works With Fluorescents!,5.0 ,"Quick Review: If you're converting your light switches to z-wave controlled ones but want to use fluorescent bulbs, this is the answer. Installation is easy as long as you know a little bit about electrical wiring, otherwise it might be a little more difficult for you. Get them for around $40 here on Amazon Full Review: I decided to start switching over my home to use z-wave for home automation and needed to find light switches to use around my house. After reading some of the reviews for the dimmer version of this switch, I opted to go for these to convert my home. I already have fluorescent light bulbs for almost every light fixture and being able to dim most of the lights was not a priority for me. This product the same as the one included in the 3-way package GE 45614 Z-Wave 3-Way On/Off Switch Kit which includes an auxiliary switch (GE 45610) so that you can have it control a 3-way (or 4-way, you'll need another aux switch) circuit. I used these instead of the GE 45606 Z-Wave Technology 2-Way Dimmer Switch due to the fact almost every single light in my house is florescent. To wire in the switch, you need to have ground, neutral, line (hot), and load (to the light) in the electrical box. Now you should be able to check your wiring and verify you have all the needed wires before tearing everything apart. For me, all the neutral wires were bound together, capped off, and shoved to the back of the box. I have installed a total of 5 of these now. The first one took about 20min. The next ones went a lot faster and installed in about 10min or less. Quick hints: -Mark the wires as you take them off the switch! -Check and double-check you're hooking up the correct wire to the correct spot on the switch. You'll feel stupid having to undo it all when you mix up the line and load wires. -If you have 2 or more of these installed next to one another, you'll need to break off the tabs on the side so they can fit close enough together to put the decorative plate over them. Only break off the ones you need to get them to fit. -For double- and triple-gang installations, I just daisy-chained the neutral (same with the hot/line) because it was just easier than pulling out the whole bundle for me. (No idea if this follows local wiring code but it's working just fine.) Other Thoughts; The blue LED isn't extremely bright and doesn't bother me. By default, it is ON when the switch if OFF and OFF when the switch is ON. It can help someone unfamiliar with the light switch location to find it in the dark. If you have an advanced remote, you can switch it so the LED is ON when the switch is ON. You can also install the switch upside-down and flip it to the correct way using an advanced remote. I haven't tested either of these because the default is what I needed. I have paired these switches to a couple different types of remotes and it has worked fine with all of them, A Go Control panel, one of the basic GE remotes, and a Intermatic HA-07 remote. Hurray for interoperability! You can hear the relay in the switch click when your turn it on and off. Not really a big deal because my old switches clicked when I flipped them on and off.

Pretty infuriating experience,1.0 ,"Bought 6 of these. One of them worked. Pairing with a SmartThings hub was the issue. Even attempting device exclusion didn't work. The manual button to toggle outlet seemed faulty. This is needed to toggle the device into pairing mode but as mentioned, the button would not operate on 5 out of 6 of these devices.

I wish I could put them in my whole house.,4.0 ,"I recently added the GE Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Switch & Dimmer to my smart home collection and they have both been a great addition to the system. I first got the switch because I wanted to control my outside lights. Every night before I went to bed I would always have to go down and make sure the lights were such off. Most of the time I would forget and they were left on all night. Now I don’t even think about it because they are set up on my SmartThings system to automatically come on when the sun sets and automatically shut off at a specific time. Then I got the dimmer switch to control my family room lights. Sometimes when we watch movies we like to have a little bit of light but most of the time we like them off. Well, now we can do both and what makes it better is we can speak to Alexa and say, “Turn the family room lights to 30%” or “Turn the family room lights off” and we don’t have to run over to the switch to do it. The connection between SmartThings and the Echo allow us to use voice commands to control them. Just in case the lights get left on, through SmartThings I have them automatically shut off so they don’t get left on. I really like the switches and they have been a great addition to my smart home. I decided to go with the GE version because 1, they could be mounted on my wall and look like all the other switches that I have in my house. 2, they could be used by the SmartThings system but I could also manually turn them on and off. 3, because they were the cheapest. I would love to put these in my whole house but the price isn’t where in needs to be to get widely adopted. I hope that changes soon. With all the smart home stuff being so new, the price points are still a little too high for the value it provides. As for the installation, it was fairly easy. I did run into some problems with the neutral wire that you need to connect because the instructions were not all that clear on it. I watched a couple of the install videos that I found online and then I was able to quickly get them set up and working. Because the product is bulkier than a normal switch, I do have a problem with getting the face plate flush with the wall. I either need to adjust the box in the wall so it sits back a little more or find a faceplate that can cover the gap that the switch has made. Not a big deal but just a pesky little thing that I think about every time I manually use the switch. Getting the switched paired to the SmartThings system was simple. All you need to do is go the ‘Connect new device’ and they get instantly recognized and lets you go through the setup process. Overall, great product and would recommend it for any smart home users.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Works great...but installation a little tricky if more complex than a single gang box,4.0 ,"Installed two of these as my first foray into Z-wave using alarm.com. The technology and range work great. I have mine on outside lights set to turn on at dusk and off at dawn and they both work very well. Installation is another story. Given my limited electrical experience and the fact that these will be installed by a lot of diy'ers like me, the installation instructions could have been a little more clear. If I hadn't looked at some of the reviews on Amazon, I wouldn't have known how to handle the neutral wire. All mine were wrapped up in the box, and given the likelihood this is will be the case for many of these installations, that additional little tidbit of information would have been helpful. In a multiple gang box, you have to find the one that goes to the light you're trying to control and use the included jumper to go back into the cluster of neutral wires.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Be prepared to return.,2.0 ,"I have installed numerous switch and outlets over time and this went in just like any other. However, the reason for a 2 star rating is simple. The switch only worked for about 2 minutes and then stopped working. I tested it during installation and it worked. When I put the face plate on and checked it again it didn't work. I took the switch out and triple checked my connections and they were all secure. I am disappointed because I really did want this to work. I was going to give it a 1 but its possible I got a defective switch, however, unlikely since it did work at one point. The other downside to this brand of switch is that this switch wont work with a dumb switch for a 3 way light. Not sure why you need the add on switch for it to work properly when there is already a traveler wire going between the switches. This switch should be smart enough to know if the dumb switch is in the on or off position. The switch itself also has a slight delay when turning the lights on or off.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Lazy people sing the praise...,4.0 ,I installed this unit as I have a bad back and I like to vary my lighting in my office. It does what it advertises but if there is one fault it is that you can tap the off (down) and the lights go all-off. If you tap on (up) the lights only go to the last level thay were at. If you want full bright you have to hold the switch until the room glows fully bright. I bought the remote control that accompanies this wall switch and you have to do the same thing with the remote switch that links to the wall switch. No big deal using the remote as I am already sitting and can hold itt down to go full bright but for the price I would like to see a bit more on the lighting variance control.

Can't use manual on/off to wireslessly switch a lightbulb using Wink Hub. Installation Issues,1.0 ,"I wanted to use this wall switch to wirelessly turn on/off an LED lightbulb located elsewhere in my house without running a lot of wire from the switch to the bulb. The command chain should have been: push wall switch --> switch sends signal via z-wave to wink hub --> wink hub sends signal to GE Link LED bulb to turn on. Sounds easy, right? Here's the issue: the switch does not send a signal to the Wink hub when it is manually turned on or off. The documentation does not make this clear. Apparently the Lutron Caseta switch will do this, so I'm trying this next. The second issue is that the wiring of this product, without a neutral, REQUIRES AN INCANDESCENT BULB TO BE PLUGGED IN AT ALL TIMES. What, did you read that right? Yes you did. Here's why: the switch draws a little bit of power. If you have an old house like mine, power goes to your wall outlet, then the hot (120 V) wire of your outlet runs to the switch. The old manual switch simply connect and disconnects this hot wire. However, a new switch like the Jasco requires a hot wire and a neutral, so that current can flow from hot, through the Jasco, to the neutral (and power the z-wave functions of the switch). If there's not neutral, where does the current flow? Well the people at Jasco want the current to flow, from the hot, through the Jasco switch, through an incandescent bulb, and into neutral. Probably not the greatest design. This is a problem with all switches which require power. There are several (bad) alternatives to this wiring scheme, so this remains an open problem to be solved.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Also you now have a bulk of wires behind the outlet. Sure you could cut the wire off and strip it down, but why should you have too?

I have the regular zwave version installed for a bedroom fan and it paired up just fine as a dimmable light using inclusion mode,2.0 ,"THis review is for the ""zwave plus"" version used along with the wink hub. I have the regular zwave version installed for a bedroom fan and it paired up just fine as a dimmable light using inclusion mode in the wink 2 hub. This works great for fan speed control. I purchased this newer zwave plus version this time as it was newer technology. This newer ""plus"" version will not show up in the wink app, it does pair with the hub as the wink customer service rep could see it as an unknown device on his end when I called for help. The rep said it is likely a bug in the wink system and will be fixed by wink at some point but as of June 2017, it does not pair. Otherwise, it does work manual at the switch, and if it were to pair I would give it 5 stars. While it is likely an issue in winks system, the switch is advertised as working with the wink hub. So as of June 2017 you might be better off with the less expensive previous version.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721",B0013V1SRY

Very disappointed,1.0 ,"Very disappointed. After spending nearly 4 hours trying to get a 3-way setup (using this and the add-on switch) I had zero luck. I checked and double checked my electrical wiring setup and did exactly as told with no success. I thought perhaps that the switch needed to be paired to even function as a light switch but was not able to get the smartthings hub to see it. I also tryied a a single pole setup with the other switch I bought with zero success. Only with the single pole setup was I able to actually hear a sound from the device indicating it was attempting to switch on but it was not doing anything. I was actually able to get that switch to be recognized by the hub but turning the lights on and off did nothing. Suffice it to say, I am extremely disappointed in these GE devices. I have numerous other smartthings devices and acknowledge the sometimes difficult setup process (especially with pairing) but I can tolerate that. This experience was downright frustrating and turned me off these switches.

Just removed a ton of these stupid things.,1.0 ,I just pulled 13 of these out of a house I recently purchased. They suck. I hated pressing the buttons because sometimes nothing would even happen. Then when it did happen the light was dim and I would have to turn it up. The whole concept of turning a light on from your phone is stupid and a waste of money. Not to mention none of the reviews I read were by licensed electricians. This brings me to my next point. For those of you planning on using these as a 3-way switch you shouldn't do it unless your house has 4-wire going into the boxes. In my house the ground was used as a neutral in all the switches because it was only wired with 3 wire. I would also like to point out that these switches were heating up too. I actually had to let them cool before removing them. Now after reading these I can see that you're all the most brilliant people who obviously know everything about electricity. I would still recommend having a LICENSED electrician look at your wiring and see if you should do it or not. My friend is a licensed electrician and helped me with this. He said it was unsafe not to mention stupid. Just a word of caution. I replaced all these switches with safer ones for less than the cost of one switch. What is wrong with people?

"Took a little tweaking to set up, but works perfectly",5.0 ,"I was a bit hesitant to spend this much on a smart controller for our pool pump, but the old mechanical timer we had was not working right, so it was worth whatever it took to not have to walk outside twice a day to turn the stupid thing on and off. The setup was fairly straightforward. I decided to pair it with a Wink hub. I can't remember exactly the issue I ran into, but I did have some problems that prompted me to first call Wink (who couldn't help), then to call Z-wave directly (they answer the issues customers have in leiu of GE). Z-wave was able to get me on the right track. The only thing I don't like about it, which is more of a Wink problem I think, is that I had to set this switch up as a ""light"", since lights and switches are on the same interface in the Wink app. That doesn't make sense to me, but Alexa still listens when I say ""Turn on the pool pump"", so whatever. I ended up making a Wink robot for it to turn on from 4:00pm to 8:00pm, and time out after 4 hours anytime (for when I run it ""manually"", it will turn off in 4 hours). Those things work perfectly. I'm very happy now that it all runs smoothly.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Used for sprinkler pump,5.0 ,"Honestly, I can't speak to the z-wave programming much since I use the most basic of aspects (on, off, schedule). But so far, this was the easiest one to include in my Wink Hub 2. First off, I'm far from an electrical expert. I lucked out that the previous electrician labeled the cables in the old timer; making swapping out a million times easier. Now your set up may vary, but from the sprinkler pump came 2 cables only for me. Both are load since it is a 230 V motor. This timer handles up to 240 V. I'm not sure if it matters which is ""load 1"" or ""load 2,"" but they attach to terminals 5 and 6 when doing a single pole setup (in other words only 1 item is being attached). This timer supposedly can handle 2 things being attached though. This is where the one and only issue with this service came up. The diagram shows load 1 goes to terminal 6 and load 2 to terminal 4. The 120 V setup also shows the load going to terminal 6. This tells me that terminal 6 is the main load bearing terminal. Yet the written instructions for 240 V single pole have the load wires connecting in reverse (load 1 to terminal 4 and load 2 to terminal 6)! This confused me quite a deal, but then I thought ""aren't sprinkler pumps DC connections?"" If so, then it shouldn't matter which lots goes to which since there is no positive note negative polarity. Long story short, I test ran out before screwing the box to the wall and the pump turned on. I followed the diagram, so proof following diagram for sprinkler pump works. The line cables attach to terminals 1 and 2. Ground goes to the ground screw on bottom center. I did find this an odd location since the old mechanical timer has the ground physically attached to the mechanism. Part of me doesn't fully believe the timer mechanism of this service is sufficiently grounded based on the designs of the old one. I'm also slightly concerned about a lack of ground to the motor itself. This isn't an issue with this item, more like I'm assuming the previous electrician may have cut it off. Now if you followed the terminals, you'll notice I have used terminals 1, 2, 4, and, 6. Terminals 3 and 5 get connected using a jumper cable that isn't included. I got lucky that I had some good electrical cable hanging around since we were remodeling. If not, I'd have to buy a spool just for about 4 inches of wire! It recommended to use the same type of wire used within walls (I believe 16 gauge solid copper) for the jumper. I had some 16 gauge stranded copper wire, but the package clearly states ""low voltage use only."" I'd say a 240 V application is far from low voltage. Pairing depends on your z-wave setup. Since I have Wink, there is no official compatibility for this device. Wink sees it as a light switch. I have emailed them a recommendation to add this device as a new category for heavy applications. Either way, it was included faster than any of the other switches I have. The day of writing this review was also the second time the schedule ran. I need to be out the door by the second zone being active. I woke up to the motor running. This is final proof that Wink is communicating the schedule to this device and it turns on and off accordingly. Funny final note: I feel this looks like a very fat antique cell phone once you attach the antenna 😂","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

"Works Fine with Z-Wave, Doesn't Pair With Z-Wave Plus",2.0 ,"The switch works fine with a regular Z-Wave controller, such as the Aeon Labs ZStick 2E. It has pretty good range and is the only module I could find that's enclosed for use outdoors. While it's designed to be used outdoors, you must use it in a location that's protected from the elements. It's not designed to be put on the ground and get rained on, for example. However, when I upgraded to a ZWave Plus controller, the Aeon Labs ZStick Plus, the switch won't pair with Z-Wave Plus, and neither will the other GE module I have, a wall socket. Aeon Labs tells me that it's using an old version of Z-Wave but I can't upgrade the firmware, so I'm stuck having two networks, one regular and one Plus, if I want to use the GE modules.

Love these,5.0 ,"First off they are fantastic repeaters. I had an issue where one of the light switch controllers wouldn't work once in a while as if it was just within range so loses communication sometimes. I got one of these and plugged it in a socket further away than the light switch and now problem solved! The metal housing of the electric switches really limit its range so you may need repeaters like this. I also now use it for my humidifier so it automatically turns itself off after 8 hours, maybe an hour before all the water gets used up since I hate when that happens. I use another to charge a battery that has an absolute limit of 8 hours on the dumb charger so it'll turn off after seven hours. I use the Vera3 and this works perfectly with it.

Works like a champ / integrated seamlessly with existing Vivint alarm system,5.0 ,"First off, this is cheaper than the standard indoor Z-Wave small appliance outlet. The only difference beyond the ""outdoor"" (better seals) characteristic, is that this unit doesn't have a variable output (dimming) feature. Which is fine since we've never utilized this function. Once unpackaged, I plugged it into an open AC outlet and went to the alarm system control panel and told it I wanted to add a switch. As soon as the link button on the module was pressed, the control panel immediately beeped and recognized the new device. That was it! The remote outlet was ready to be moved to its permanent location. And because it's recognized by the alarm system, it can be controlled and automated like any other device as if it were part of the original setup. Two of the great selling points of Z-Wave devices: 1. I haven't found one that is incompatible with our existing network, and; 2. the Z-Wave network is bidirectional. A wireless 802.11a/b/g/n network range is limited by the router's transmission radius, but Z-Wave uses each component as a repeater. The control panel is not a limiting factor because each device can relay communications from any other device as long as one of them in the chain is close enough to link with the control panel. For the sake of full disclosure, we're not using this outside and cannot attest to how it stands up to the elements. But since it works so well, we may be getting a couple more for some project ideas and I'll let you know how they work out if that comes to be.

Sometimes I'll have to send the on/off command multiple times. Once it finds the plug again, it works fine. I am either going to get a wifi repeater, or another GE Z-Wave device since they also repeat the signal. If the wifi repeater does the trick, and I confirm that's the only issue, I will bump this review up to 5 stars.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

"OK but range is limited - review for GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module,",3.0 ,I bought 3 of these to use outside for my landscape lights. I found the range to be a lot smaller than advertised. I could not get the product to connect from outside the house. I use them with Iris so tried an Iris smart plug in the same outlet. The iris plug worked well - no problems with range. I still have one of these plugged in to a set of lights outside.

"Nice, when it works",2.0 ,"Nice design, easy to pair with SmartThings, and I like that it has one controllable outlet and one pass-through. It works well when it actually works, but it only responds maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of the time. I put it on an outlet under my couch to control a lamp next to the couch, but now I end up having to lay down and reach under the couch to hit the button on it when I want to use the lamp. It' turned out to be more of a hassle than it's worth.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Some design faults,2.0 ,"This unit would not connect to the Wink Hub, and I had to return it. I spent hours on the phone with the Wink folks, but they couldn't help. They said that either the device was defective or there was a radio channel defective on the Wink. They couldn't tell. If it had worked, I am not sure I would have liked it. It's rather large ad takes up a lot of space. The push switch in the center of the device is hard to push with the way it is recessed. Also, I wasn't sure that I was making a positive connection as it is spongy and does not click. No light to show that it is working or not. If it worked, I would probably have kept it, but would not buy another one because of the size.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Perfect for power cycling a PI (read the review!),5.0 ,"Have a Z-Wave system and need the ability to turn power on and off remotely, this is perfect for you. I use this to power cycle a raspberry PI located in an out of the way part of an inaccessible attic above our garage. Sometimes the PI freezes and needs to be rebooted - even if I am home, I had to go into the garage, lower the ladder, get up inside, tread over the insulation very carefully and unplug and replug the PI (reverse steps to get down) - when I am away from home - not possible. Now, I just open up my VERA app and power cycle and the PI is back up and running.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

"Quality build, reliable function, and ease of installation on SmartThings/Echo networks",5.0 ,Well constructed weather proofed switch. Slightly bigger footprint than otherwise anticipated but again it's of quality construction. Most importantly the switch does exactly what it is supposed to do and could not be any more simple to set-up and configure. A voice command to my Amazon Echo linked to my SmartThings hub turns my outdoor Christmas lights on or off without having to step outside. Even better I just configured them to turn on and off on a schedule coinciding with daylight and dusk.

Great add on to your smart home,4.0 ,"I bought this to control the lamp in my living room. I was tired of having to keep running around the house to turn off all of the lights before bed, and having to come home to a dark house after work. I had bought this to put on the lamp in my living room. This has been a great product. I also have 1 in my bedroom. This has an outlet on both sides, so it's perfect for living rooms and bedrooms which have lamps on 2 sides. The dimmer doesn't work all that great with CFL's or IKEA LEDARE Bulbs.

Great working z-wave enabled wireless plug adapter,5.0 ,"This is a review for the GE 45603 z wave wireless control plug. They call it a lighting control module, but it can actually be used to control anything you want to plug in. The back of the module has your normal 3 prong plug that goes right into your normal electrical wall outlet. Then on the left side and right side of the module, you find your AC plug outlets. Only one side is z wave enabled, the other side is always on, just like your regular wall plug. I love these more than the duplex wall outlet because it doesn't require any installation. That means no wires, no electrical box & fuses to mess with, no screwdriver or electrician. Just plug and play. The center button works as the on off button for the z-wave enabled outlet. I would make sure not to put this in a place where it can easily be kicked or knocked. Note: This works with Aeon, Smart Things & Mi Casa Verde. Overall, great product. Works like a champ. GE guaranteed. Would recommend this over any other option out there.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Great as a ZWave Bridge between buildings,3.0 ,"Works well however the antenna seems rather directional and not in the way I originally wanted. My intended setup was to use this to bridge my ZWave network between my house and my detached garage which is ~50ft away to support a ZWave door lock. Due to the better than average but still limited operating temperature range, the unit needed to be indoors for me - Canadian Winters. By facing the unit 'button' side towards the house I was able to complete the network and can now control devices in my garage; The face with the switch on it appears to have the best antenna exposure.

Works great to control my garage lights via my SmartThings hub,4.0 ,"Works great to control my garage lights via my SmartThings hub. I wish it were a bit slimmer (or perhaps had an external plug?), because it takes up a lot of space around the outlet.

NOT a right-angle plug,4.0 ,"I haven't actually tested out the functionality of this producdt yet, but one issue is that this does NOT have a right-angle plug, but rather a normal plug. The image is incorrect. It looks like it did have a right-angle plug at one time, but does not now. In my situation this makes it harder to install in the space I wanted to install it in. The other issue is that the power cord is quite thick and not that flexible. The thickness may be by design and I understand that, but still makes some installations more difficult.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
used with both the Nexia bridge and VeraLite - works very well! Unpair from one before trying to pair to another controller.,5.0 ,"I've been immersed in ZWave for nearly 2 years now. This GE outdoor control module is perfect to year-round outdoor use, whether it be to control holiday lighting displays, to turn on/off a heating element in a pond or water bucket, to control the heat tape under a mobile home, to control a pump on a pond, to control a bug zapper in the yard, a fan in the barn or dog kennels, etc. I often think of this when a friend is dehydrating liver to make homemade liver treats, her husband kicks her and her dehydrator out of the house but there are times she's said she had to wait around at home to unplug the dehydrator at a set time - she could use this to turn off the dehydrator remotely if needed. The uses are quite endless! I successfully used this outdoor controller with both Nexia as well as VeraLite controllers, no issues with either. Always unpair a Z-Wave device from one controller before trying to pair with a new controller.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Good product with one glaring flaw,4.0 ,I ordered this to control newly purchased landscape lighting. I have it paired via Z-Wave to my Wink Hub and everything works as described. That said there is one GLARING issue with this product and it is cord length -- it's way to short. The manual states to connect it to a GFCI circuit and I did but to connect it to a horizontally mounted box and close the cover it severely limits placement (the device must be mounted vertically with outlet facing down). GE: please double the length of the cord and you have a 5 star winner.

Awesome Way To Control Outdoor Lights & Christmas Lights,5.0 ,I live this thing mated with the Samsung SmartThings hub. Now when someone knocks on the front door my outdoor lights flash to let me know someone is there when I'm in the back yard and don't hear the door. The distance from the hub scared me because it's probably 75 feet or more from the switch. It was intermittent on getting a signal from the hub until I installed another z-wave wall switche nearby which acts as a repeater. Since then it's never missed a signal to turn on or off and responses very quickly.,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Great z-wave product,5.0 ,"I just got started with home automation and this was the first device that I purchased to test out if I wanted to invest in more devices. Sure enough, I'm now hooked. PROS: 1) It has 2 outlets on the sides of the device. Since the device measures 4 inches wide and 1-1/2 inches deep, having the plugs on the side of the device minimizes the depth of the device. 2) It has one outlet that is controlled by z-wave and a separate outlet on the other side that is ""always on"" (i.e., not controlled by z-wave). This ""always on"" outlet means that you don't lose access to an outlet just because the device is plugged in. Very cleaver design. 3) The device has a button on the front of the device, which is used to (a) pair the device with a controller and (b) turn the z-wave outlet on/off. The on/off function is handy when you are close to the device (and not a controller) and want to use the light/appliance that is connected to the z-wave outlet. 4) The device pairs well and easily with the GE controller (which is very inexpensive through Amazon) and Mi Casa Verde Vera Lite controller (also available through Amazon and other distributors). When the device is paired with the Vera Lite, it can be controlled by computer, phones, tablets, etc. ITEMS TO CONSIDER: I don't want to call these ""cons"" because these items are not a problem for me, but may be a concern to others. 1) the device measures about 4 inches wide and 1-1/2 inches deep. You should measure your space before purchasing if you think it will be problematic. However, from what I have read, the size of the device helps with the z-wave ""mesh network"" and provides stronger signals/boosts compared to ""permanently"" installed receptacles/outlets. (So the size is actually a benefit to the system). 2) there is a noticeable ""click"" sound when the z-wave outlet is activated (on or off). The sound is present when the outlet is activated with the button on the front of the device or through an app, but it is only present when turning on/off the outlet and not at any other time. It isn't super loud, but it is noticeable (kind of like a soft finger snap sound).","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
"Built well, and works well w/ my Z-wave system",5.0 ,"My MiCasaVera system was very easy to add this unit in to. I use it to control a bug zapper Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Insect Killer, 1/2 Acre Coverage so it only goes on at dusk, and off in the AM. Though it's certainly not cheap at around $50, it is something you can hold in your hand and recognize ""ok, this is built well."" The grounded plug is able to be plugged into my in-use (covered) GFCI, and not block the outlet or the reset buttons, and the female receptacle seems well engineered in its slightly recessed location, and the rubber flap to cover it when not using it (though I don't know why you'd have the Z-wave adapter plugged in) is also well made. There are strain reliefs built into the cord at both the male plug end and the z-wave adapter end. Anecdotally, however this thing is engineered, it also rarely (if ever) trips the very sensitive GFCI I have it plugged into (whereas plugging in, or turning on certain things that are plugged into this outlet, often trip it). My outlet itself might be slowly failing, but I thought it's worth mentioning that if you're reluctant to put a switch on an outdoor load plugged into a GFCI, thinking that adding more ""hard"" switches on/off to that GFCI in the form of a z-wave adapter would be a bad idea, it has been smooth sailing for me with this one.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Now with the press of a button, I can turn on all my lights in the backyard, and even press a button to dim the light fixtures to the same brightness as the rope lights and have an amazing ambient lighting scene. Best of all, I am no longer turning on 3 switches in different rooms, attempting to match up the dimming level to look good with the rope lights, and also then having to kneel on the ground behind outdoor furniture to turn on the two sets of rope lights and then have to do it again when I go in at the end of the night. Beware of Amazon Warehouse Deals - I bought one of these discounted and it did not work properly.

GE Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control,5.0 ,"After my experience with the Z-Wave equipped Kwikset lock, I decided to purchase this item when it was on sale. I am very happy with this device. Again, using my DMP 50 system with this switch required that I have a company tech person come out for initial install and programming (cost!). Once that was done, and it was easy, I can move the devices around and turn different items on and off. Simple remote operation is enable, and it can be done also using the DMP 50 favorites, schedules, and so forth as provided in the security system. Action (lights actually coming or whatever) again take perhaps 15-20 second to actually occur once commands are issued, as with the lock unit. Still, not a big issue! I strongly recommend these after a few weeks usage. Also, BTW, it is said that these devices extend the range of the other devices on the Z-Wave ""network"". That is one of the reasons I purchased one. I cannot tell for sure, as there are other variables, but I think this may be working with lock status and some other commends not related to this switch. In any case, as a switch, it works well!","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Replaces my grow timers,5.0 ,"I don't even use this for floor lamps, I programmed them through my Frontpoint home automation system to be the electronic timers (using rules under empower) to run a grow schedule for my plants & their lights, air, and water pumps. Mechanical timers are great, but every time you bump them they fall out of adjustment, sometimes they fail, sometimes they work slow... Home automation lets me schedule when I want my plants to wake up and when I want them to go to sleep. I can even set separate veg and flower schedules. If these were marketed as intelligent grow timers they'd probably sell a lot more of them. I think I'm up to 8 so far, as long as you don't go beyond the amp rating (15A) you should be fine.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Works great!,5.0 ,"Worked great with my ADT Pulse system. I have a Z Wave door lock that was installed by ADT. The ADT tech told us that we'd need to purchase our first light control from them {$69) but after reading some reviews here it sounded like I could just buy them elsewhere. On Amazon they are less than half price and abput $10 less expensive than the big box stores. The directions were scanty. Now that I figured out how to activate and get my Pulse to recognize and schedule, it works great. I love that I can turn the light on or off at a scheduled time or from my phone. I have ordered more of these. The more of these controls you have, the better the system works because the form a network inside your home.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Great for controlling Intex pump and saltwater generator,5.0 ,"I purchased 2 of these to control my Intex pool pump/filter and saltwater generator. I hated the timer built into the pump, as you needed to turn it on at the exact time you want it to run and then set it for how many hours you want it to run. If the power went out, the GFI on the pump would trip which meant no filter running even when the power came back on. This was a problem when leaving for an extended weekend and not being home to babysit it. So I got 2 of these, cut off the GFI plugs and put regular ones on and plugged them into these and then into a GFI outlet. I paired these with my Vera3 Lite and then had total control of when the pumps came on/off, didn't matter if power went out, and I could control them remotely through my phone. Now that swimming season is over I am going to use them for outdoor Christmas lights. Keep in mind this was used with a small Intex pump that was within the specs. Larger pool pumps will most likely max this thing out.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Simple & easy to use ZWave light switch,5.0 ,"I recently purchased the MiCasaVerde Vera Lite Zwave controller. I purchased this as my first test device. Without reading the instructions, I was able to easily add it to my Vera Lite UI 5 version 1.5.408 easily. Just pushed the include button on the Vera Lite and the on/off switch on the GE adapter. Now I can control a room light on my iPhone or through the web. I was also able to include it in scenes for automation. Pros: * Simple to use and install without requiring swapping out wall units. * great to use as a portable zwave controller. Easily transportable throughout the house. Cons: * Not a biggie but makes a loud clicking noise when device switches on and off. Might be an issue if you have a few of these in the same room. * Your lamp's switch should be set to on and power toggle handled by the GE device. If you want to manually turn on your lamp you may have to reach down to the ground to push the on/off switch if you have this plugged to an outlet near the floor. * A bit bulky looking. If they could miniaturize so at least it is the width of the wall outlet it would be more pleasing aesthetically.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

This is a bit of a pain, especially if your outlet is not easy to get to.

Very Nice and Easy to Setup,5.0 ,"Purchased two of these for my lamps in my living room. Very easy to setup and I love how it doesn't block the electrical outlet. One Side of the device has a Zwave written on it and the other is a pass through, This way you don't lose an plug in the process. Super easy to add to my Zwave network. Brought my Z wave controller in Add mode up to the device. Clicked the manual button on the GE device, to add it. Plugged My Aeon Labs Z stick back into my computer and worked right away. Many ideas you can use this item for I have seen people use them for Air conditioners that are in your window.

Works well but watch the pricing,4.0 ,"I have this outlet connected to my Samsung Smartthings hub to control our outdoor low voltage landscape lighting. It works well but I have had some inconsistencies in the reliability of it turning on at times. Frankly, I suspect the Smartthings firmware as things seem to change every time Samsung updates their firmware (which has occurred 4 times in the past 6 weeks). So I am giving this outlet 4 stars as I'm not 100% sure where the problem lies. However, I just bought a second one to control an outdoor water fountain and a third one for the same purpose so I will report back on these next two in a few weeks. I paid $33 for my first one on Amazon just 5 weeks ago, $26 for my second one 2 weeks ago and just noticed these same GE outlets are now priced at $48 on Amazon. So I went to my local Lowe's and paid $37 for my third device.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

I get around this by just turning it off with my phone, but for an outdoor product, I would've expected this to be not an issue.

Great when working - Updates - Now working,5.0 ,"I purchased two of these to use with my home alarm and automation system. Can turn lights on and off via a cell phone application or by events such as door sensors opening. This is all incredibly easy to do. One of the units recently started indicating fault conditions. These self resolve in a few hours but may be signs of impending failure. I purchased another just in case. Hope it is a fluke as I really like these. Updates - The device finally failed totally, or so I thought. When I next visited the property where it is installed I found that the CFL it controlled was burned out. I replaced it with another and the controller is now working perfectly. Perhaps the problem all along was with the CFL being deficient. In any event I'm raising my rating as the issue does not appear to have been correctly diagnosed the first time.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

bad range,2.0 ,"I got this to work with my Revolv home automation hub, and found that it doesn't work well because a) the range on z-wave devices is quite bad, and b) they work better with mutiple z-wave devices. This is outside on my patio, one story and about 10 feet from my insteon hub and only works sporadically - 1 out of 10 times at best. Revolv support says: it is a known issue that the exterior walls of your home will diminish the Z-wave signal a lot based on the way those walls are typically constructed. According to a chart included in one of GE's instruction manuals, the range can be as little as 21 feet if the exterior walls are constructed of brick, tile or concrete. Since you already have a few Insteon devices in your home and Insteon communicates both via radio and through your home's electrical wiring, it may be best to pick up one of these for outdoor use: Insteon 2634-222 On/Off Dual-Band Outdoor Module If you'd like to stick with Z-wave devices, then I recommend adding at least 2 more Z-wave devices to your system so that the signal can be repeated via multiple paths to your outdoor module. You'll also want to place one of those devices within 20 to 30 ft of your outdoor module for best performance. Also, make sure the Z-wave devices are not battery powered or else they won't relay the signal. So if you are looking to use this with revolv, especially, keep all this in mind.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

I'm able to setup automation routines to turn lights on/off at certain times and when certain actions occur (such as when I disable the alarm at night). I've also used these modules to replace timers. I no longer have to reprogram the timers every time the power goes out. Also, when daylight savings occurs, I simply go into the ADT Pulse web site and adjust the on/off times in one place. Nice - no more climbing behind furniture to get the the timers.

Great if you have a smart home and need outside control,5.0 ,"Last year at Christmas I have a dusk/dawn timer with hours to keep on. It had a remote that I could turn on/off from house if needed. This year I added some more lights and since I have a smartthings control and alexa I decided to try these GE Z-Wave Outdoor lights. I used two of them. I started with one on each side of the house with the older dusk/dawn time in middle. My smartthings is located in the house near the right side. The GE outlet on the right worked fine, (it also on the wall of my master bedroom where I have two zwave switches which helps spread the z wave signal. The one on the loft side of the house only turned off at night, but wouldn't turn on the next day. I figure the signal is weak, but like listening to radio late at night, the night signal carried. No worries, I switched the left GE ZWave with the dumber Dawn/Dusk outlet and everything worked. I set up automation in the Smartthings app for dusk + 6 hours with match the dumer Dawn/Dusk outlet. I'm not sure what the smartthings app uses for Dusk but it came on about half hour after the Dawn/Dusk light with uses a sensor. Overall, I was happy and didn't need worry about my lights and they were always on when I came home which was nice.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Scroll down on the device list to <Lights> and tap on it 5. Scroll down on the 2nd list to <Zwave Switch> and tap on it 6. Tap 3 times next until you see a green <connect now> button 7. Press the 1 small button on your GE Controller 8. Tap the green <Next> and the Wink Hub goes into find and install mode. 9. About a few seconds after the Wink Hub went into device setup mode the new Z-Wave Switch should show up as new device on your iPhone. It really couldn't be much easier.

Use with our ADT pulse system,5.0 ,"We got the Pulse system a few months ago which we recommend. We wanted to add a few more of these light controllers so we can fully automate our lights in the house. These work perfect and are half the price if you bought them via the security company. Easy to program to our existing system that uses z wave technology and will be purchasing more items in the future as we continually upgrade our system. Control them via my iPad, or my android samsung galaxy III, or via a desk or laptop. Nice to be on our cruise and monitor our home and check on our house sitter and dogs from our cameras.

It's not very bright for use in an exterior fixture, but that's not important in this application - I never even turn it on. The price is better than most Z-Wave Plus devices. It's in an enclosed fixture, so hopefully it will last outdoors.

Love Z-wave devices but this seems a bit too large for the purpose,4.0 ,"I have many different types of Zwave devices in my house. Originally I bought a few of these as they can be moved around the house more easily than those which are installed to replace a traditional outlet ( GE 45605 ). I took off one star because of the design on the piece. It is big and bulky and the size seems to be unnecessary considering how it does nothing more than the GE 45605. If you will always use this in the same location, install the GE 45605 instead. If you need something to move around at will, then this is the best solution.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Flawless Control for my Outdoor Greenhouse!,5.0 ,"I picked up this module to add to my Smartthings Z-Wave network. Right now, they are controlling the lighting and heating in my outdoor greenhouse. The modules easily paired with my hub and the integration with the SmartApps and Alexa was easy. I like that the button on the front turns the switched outlet on and off so I don't always have to have my phone with me while in the greenhouse to activate the lights or heater. As someone mentioned, they are a bit beefy, so that after plugging them on on a normal power strip, you'll lose at least 2-3 outlets on that strip because the module's size will cover the nearby outlets. I've used both the Smartthings Outlet and now this one from GE and I prefer this because of the manual on/off and dual outlet feature. Pros: Rapid Response to hub commands Button for manual on/off control Easy integration with Smartthings and Alexa Works as a Z-Wave repeater and can be used to strengthen your Z-Wave network connectivity Two outlets - one controllable via smart hub (Smartthings/Alexa/Iris, etc.) and one always ""on"" Can hear an slight audible ""click"" when switched on which gives me a positive confirmation that my hub properly communicated with the module Cons: Rather ""beefy"" - when plugged into a wall outlet, it shouldn't cover the bottom outlet but can block outlets on a crowded power strip","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

If you found this review in anyway HELPFUL, PLEASE VOTE YES!!! My Star Ratings (with Amazon Ratings in parenthesis): 1 Star (I hate it!) : The lowest score possible. Definitely not worth the money and time and effort! should only use this when the product really does not reflect the product listing. If there are any positives at all to the product or its use, you should not give it 1 star. 2 Stars (I don't like it.): The product is not exactly as described, either appearance-wise or functionally. The product may still be usable but it’s very different to what was described. The product may have a few faults. I'm not a fan of this item as it is no where close to my expectations and I won't order it again, but I can imagine a few others might find it functional as it has at least one positive quality. 3 Stars (It's okay): This item has both positive and negative qualities. I can definitely see some people loving or liking it as it may work for them, but I would likely not purchase in future. While you might think a 3-star score equates to average, 3 stars counts against the product as a negative score. So if you’re not meaning to give it a negative score, rethink your 3-star rating! 4 Stars (I like it): The product is as described and functions well. There may be a few minor issues, but all in all, the product is solid. This item arrived and functions as advertised. I would change a few things about this, but is a good product overall. I would use this item. 5 Stars (I love it!): This item is AWESOME. I will use it and recommend it to others! I just LOVE it! It works as advertised and is an all-around great product. product is amazing! You love it! This is the highest of the highs. If you would recommend it to your friends, family — it’s definitely a 5-star score.

The whole point of having it is to control the lights remotely while I am away from the house. Additionally, the design of the plug makes it tough, I have a box cover on my outlets and they are rotated 90 degrees, so that the ground pin faces east instead of south. The cord has too short of lead to have the module mounted somewhere, since it bends out awkwardly from the box cover.

Finally! How to add to your Wink Hub,5.0 ,"Love these! Took me forever to figure out how to get this product to connect to our Wink Hub as this product is not recognized as a supported Wink product. If you need to connect to your Wink Hub, do this: 1) Plug your GE Z-Waze control into an outlet near your Wink Hub (needs to be within probably 6 feet of the hub) - this is just to connect it to your hub as you can move he control switch later to where you want to use it 2) Go into your Wink app on your phone 3) Click on your Wink Hub in your list of products 4) Click on the gear button at the top right hand corner to open settings 5) Click on your Wink Hub under settings 6) Scroll down until you see ""Settings"" in the middle and click on ""Z-Wave"" 7) Click on Z-Wave 8) Click on the ""Inclusion Mode"" 9) Look to see that your Wink Hub is flashing 10) Double click on the center button on your GE Z-Wave control switch until you hear it click (don't hold down the switch) - keep clicking on it until you hear a slight pop sound 11) Watch your Wink hub as it flashes green and then goes back to solid blue light 12) You should be good to go and can now see your switch now in your Wink Hub app as ""Lights + Power"") 13) Unplug your switch and move it to the appliance/lamp that you want to use 14) Hold down on the lightbulb when you open up the ""Lights + Power"" so that you can edit the name of your appliance. For example, we named one lamp ""Living Room Couch Lamp"" Hope this helps! I invested many hours in figuring out how to do this through Wink!

I even called GE Tech Support (if you can call it that), I could hear the rep typing in the question, and then she dutifully regurgitated back the script on her screen, told me to just push the button, and then she pointed the finger at Samsung. Now, whenever tech support points fingers, they're only pointing it at their own incompetence. This item was returned. Just a note -- I replaced this order with a Smartthings outlet -- which paired immediately and without issue. Guess it wasn't the hub, eh? Have a household full of devices, all of which connected to this hub without issue -- just not this GE outlet. There are numerous comments on this item not pairing with Smartthings. I thought I'd give it a try anyway. I just confirmed what many others have experienced. Evidently some others have made it work, but I, along with many, could not. The Smartthings outlet costs a few bucks more -- that's why I tried this GE outlet -- but the experience says the few bucks more are worth it.

These allow movement around the house at night in subdued light that doesn't disturb the other kids if one gets up to go down the hallway in the middle of the night.

Works better than Intermatic products,4.0 ,"But saying that, I have had some problems with these outdoor modules. I have 3 of them and two have exhibited problems: One was DOA out of the package - nothing worked, including manually. One quit after about a year - can't turn it off wirelessly but everything else works. I am using six GE plug-in appliance and lamp modules and they are all working fine. So far. About Intermatic or Wayne-Dalton units: I have experienced nearly a 50% failure rate on all of the Intermatic and Wayne-Dalton modules after 2 years. The failures have been total RF transceiver failure (no communication at all), will not turn off wirelessly or will not turn on wirelessly. The ones that manage to get past the initial 1-2 years of use usually keep working, however. I even installed a whole-house surge suppressor - no improvement. Naturally, they quit after all warranties are long gone. That's why I have been changing over to GE as the others die hoping for better reliability but now I am begining to wonder if all versions of these modules might have issues. I have a couple of the light switch dimmer modules (the ones that replace 2 or 3 way wall switches - they are brands other than Intermatic or Wayne-Dalton) and have had no issues. What's interesting is that the Intermatic controllers appear to work fine. I have one that's nearly 8 years old that still works great. However, the GE controller is easier to program and use. Addendum 11/23/2012: the second GE 45604 unit is now not usable. I can't turn it on wirelessly, only off. Note the addendum below. Addendum 3/31/2013: Fortunately I did not toss any of the ""defective"" units. Instead I used the GE 45601 remote control and all but one of the ""bad"" units worked. It would seem that 90% of my problems were the controller and not the modules so I strongly recommend NOT using the Intermatic controller but use the GE. IMPORTANT: you have to ""DELETE"" all of the modules from the network of the old controller (remove the pairing) before attempting to pair it with a new controller. If you don't, you will find that the module will not respond. I have never seen anyone mention this critical requirement. Note: the GE instructions are not 100% perfect. When setting the on/off times for groups, make sure that when you select the correct group that you want to program since it defaults to group 1. They do not mention anything about this.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

... Appliance Module + 2x Aeon Labs DSC06106-ZWUS - Z-wave Smart Energy Switch,4.0 ,"Mi Casa Verde VeraLite + 2x GE 45603 Z-Wave Technology Wireless Lighting Control Fluorescent Light & Appliance Module + 2x Aeon Labs DSC06106-ZWUS - Z-wave Smart Energy Switch: 12/12/14 First Impressions and info that wasn't immediately obvious: VeraLite: 4 Stars. Install instructions were poor - unit required an update but then then has worked well so far. Accompanying Android Vera U17 App seems a little flaky but an off/on reset seems to resolve. App permissions appear to make sense within Google's broad sweeping categories. Aeon devices set up easily as specifically listed in GUI, GE devices not listed and were added as generic devices. Options for blanket instructions based on being Home/Away/Night/Vacation & scenarios such as turn on or off at give time/days were easily set up. Energy monitoring options require sharing data with a 3rd party - did not read or accept their privacy policy so that functionality is disabled. Guessing system requires contact with the mothership so is perhaps constantly reliant on Mi Casa Verde company servers. If anyone can clarify details on that point it would be helpful - Thanks! Would buy again! GE 45603 -4 Stars - Works as described. Switches don't have an LED indicator. One controlled outlet and one pass through. As set up, they do not report current being used when switch is on - but I didn't see that indicated as a feature. If it's possible to set up within VeraLite software I'd welcome some instructions - Thanks! Two year warranty which suggests they stand by the product (assuming warranty procedure is reasonable and low cost process). Would buy again! Aeon Labs DSC06106-ZWUS - 2 stars. Works as described. Switches have an LED indicator built into toggle switch. They report current load in the Android App and VeraLite web interface when turned on. This is a nice feature -reporting that the switch is on and that the connected appliance is also functioning. Design improves accesibility relative to GE wall wart. Only 3 month warranty - that doesn't suggest confidence in their build quality (hence 2 stars) - would not have bought had I known in advance. With a more respectable warranty would have been 5 stars. Will update with any device reliability issues.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
"easy setup, convenient pass-thru outlet",4.0 ,"I got one of these with my ADT alarm system, and then decided to buy more. So now I have 6 of them, on several different things. In the past, I had a Leviton Z-Wave system, and it was difficult to set up. Over the course of a few years, one by one, the lamp modules all blew up... literally. As in sparks, smoke, loud pop, and an ever increasing dis-trust of the system. Leviton customer support was VERY quick to tell me that it was too bad, they had none left, and they had long since stopped selling them. To my interpretation, that means they KNEW there was a problem and never did anything about it. Glad none of them caught fire. So... the APPLIANCE modules, the ones that do not dim but rather just turn off and on with a physical relay... those have all been fine, and the original Leviton ones are still chugging away with no problems. So I thought... I'll get some more of those appliance ones since they don't have the dimming circuits that explode. The GE ones are VERY nice because they have the added feature of an always-on passthru outlet. the RIGHT side plug is always on. The LEFT side outlet is controlled by the switch. This serves a couple purposes. First, these devices are bigger than a single outlet on the wall, so they block the other outlet on the plate. So the passthru is helpful to regain that lost outlet. Second, both outlets face to the sides, so you don't get kinked cords. Third, the manual activation / learn button is recessed on the face, so if you push furniture up against it, it doesn't press the button. It would however, be nicer if the learn button was on the TOP of the unit, so that you could reach over the back of a couch or behind something and press it on the rare ocassion you might need to. Setup was super easy, it detected right away. So far, these units seem reliable. However, it might take a year or 2 of use to determine if they are going to go the way of the Leviton garbage ones.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

They are separated by 38 feet and the control is VERY UNRELIABLE. I have the GE controller in a piece of plastic sewer pipe to keep it from getting rained on, so the control is vertical, the way it was meant to be mounted. I have noticed that when the pipe gets knocked down and becomes horizontal, that the control seems to improve, leading me to believe there is an issue with the polarization of the antennas in each of the units. You can imagine the antenna in this controller is horizontal. By laying that GE controller down, it may be that the controller's antenna becomes horizontal, putting them in the same plane.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Awesome plug and play - but outlet is turned and not usuable by some devices,4.0 ,"These are smaller than I expected which is nice. They are very easy to install. As close to plug and play as a z-wave device could ever be. I like the easy push button on the front as well. The only thing I've found that I don't like about it so far is that the outlet's are turned inward to wall. So any plug of size won't plug into the device. I had to can appliance module and swap to wall outlet in some locations which I didn't originally want to do. I find it odd that they use this configuration for the outlets. Of course in America 99% of all outlets are installed upside down anyways. The 3rd prong as we call it, is supposed to be on the up side of the outlet. This is so that if something isn't plugged all the way in and something fell on it it won't energize the item. This could also be said for this module. Why is the 3 prong inward and not outward to reduce risk of shock???","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Great Appliance Module; Not a Dimmer,4.0 ,"If you're looking for a z-wave device that will help you improve the reliability of communications with a z-wave lock such as the Kwikset or Schlage locks, this is by far the best device to go with - it works great in this capacity, is very easy to install and connect to your network and has a pretty smart design that keeps you from losing use of an outlet as many plug-in modules tend to. It supports 'beaming', unlike some older z-wave devices, which is a must to interface with z-wave locks. However, as another reviewer noted, this is NOT a dimmer - it's designed for fluorescent lights, motors, appliances and other loads that will be either on or off and won't be dimmed. The device reports itself as a ""Z-Wave Switch Binary"", not ""Z-Wave Switch Multilevel"" or ""Z-Wave Dimmer Switch"" as it would if it was a dimmer. I've used this to turn lights on and off as well as to control the operation of an air filter whose motor didn't run well at all when plugged up to a dimmer module. Adding the module to your z-wave network couldn't be easier - put your controller in Add mode and then tap the button on the front, which also serves as a manual on/off switch for the z-wave controlled outlet. This module includes 2 outlets - one on each side; one is always on and the other is controlled by z-wave. If you plug it into the top outlet in a 2 outlet block you can still easily plug in a lamp or other device on the other outlet underneath it, so this module can actually give you 3 outlets where you previously had 2, unlike other modules that turn your 2 outlet block into basically just 1 usable outlet.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

the Mothership is an Unreliable Vendor,3.0 ,"AmazonLLC sent me a previously opened package (the clear tape-circles that seal the box had been cut and one of them had been replaced with a black tape-circle (the manuals were crinkly too). I think, legally, they're supposed to sell that as a refurb. I'd have been delighted to have been offered a refurb - - at a discount. What really ticks me off is that they didn't delink the failed install by the previous purchaser. That should be *Step One* in getting a refurb of a zwave device ready for resale. Figuring out that the module had a failed link and then delinking it consumed an hour of my life that I'm not going to get back. (Once I figured that out, delinking, relinking, & confirming the connection took all of 2 minutes.) The product (so far) works great.

Epic Fail in less than a year,1.0 ,"UPDATE January 2014: The original unit failed after less than a year. I will test the 2 year warranty by sending it back. So I bought another last week because the reviews still are so good for this device. FAIL: the new unit was DOA. I am done with this brand of Z-wave. Almost all of the original Intermatic HomeSettings modules I installed 7 years ago are still going strong. So this performance is not the norm for Z-wave. ORIGINAL Review - I gave it 4 stars: I've added this controller to my Homeseer 3 z-wave system and it is working great. I had used Intermatic Homesettings modules, but they are hard to find now. The deduction of a star is because of the shape and configuration of this module. The manual on/off button is not reachable when the unit is located behind a piece of furniture and the wider size means it sticks out more beyond the faceplate of the receptacle. The Intermatic units were exactly the size of a faceplate and the button on top is more accessible for manual operation. Despite the limitations, this module is a good value and works very well, but consider the location you will use it in before buying.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Great for pool pumps!,5.0 ,"Excellent pool pump switch! I've got mine programmed with Samsung SmartThings hub and it works great! I also really like that the pump can be manually switched without having to open the case (just push the big grey button)! There are no programming instructions provided so I had to figure that out on my own. I used the ""Smart Lighting"" app that is included with the Samsung SmartThings hub. To program, go to Automation, then SmartApps, tap ""Add a SmartApp"", then tap ""Lights & Switches"", then tap ""Smart Lights"" and follow the instructions. I've posted a couple pictures that show the settings I've used. This switch was also helpful in determining what has causing huge electric bills in our house. Surprisingly, it's not the pool pumps! The energy monitoring feature of this switch is mostly a novelty but interesting none the less. I bought initially because I thought it'd be a fun novelty to be able to turn the pump on with Alexa, but its really much more useful than that. I can control and/or reprogram the run-time of the pump from anywhere. Perfect example is that I recently had to run the pump for 24 hours after adding chemicals. I manually started the pump on a Thursday evening and went out of town the following morning but forgot to turn off the timer, so the pump shut off, as scheduled, at noon Friday (6 hours shy of 24 hours). I was able to turn the pump back on 200 miles away and complete the 24 hour cycle. I never would have been able to do this without this switch. The only issue I initially had was signal range, due to the placement of my hub and pump (approximately 50 feet apart with several interior walls, a brick fireplace and two stone walls the way). I imagine this isn't a common issue, but if it happens to you, I solved the problem by buying a Z-Wave dimmer to control my patio lights (mid way between my hub and this switch) and that solved the problem. All Z-Wave products act as a signal repeater, so the patio dimmer bridged the gap between my hub and pool pump, and I got really cool patio lighting!","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Head to Head comparison,4.0 ,"I bought the Intermatic HA04C and the GE45604 Z-Wave outdoor modules because they were the same price and I needed two to reach the pump I wanted to control. My intention was to use one halfway to relay the signal to the other one controlling the pump. The GE unit has a well built rubber cap that completely protects the outlet when nothing is plugged in. If your intention is to leave this unit outside all year when nothing is plugged in then this GE is the hands down best choice. The Intermatic has an exposed outlet with no cover. The nice feature on the Intermatic though is a light to indicate power to the outlet. The GE module has no such indication. Both modules have a button on the face to manually turn the outlet on and off. The button on the GE is slightly recessed and and a little harder to press. I tested the range on both units using an extension cord measuring the distance that the Z-Wave signal worked reliably with no retries. The Intermatic's range was 64' and the GE's range was 74' or 90' depending on orientation. The GE module range is 16' further if the power cord on the unit is facing the Z-Wave signal source which in my case is a Vera Lite. I also have the AEON LABS indoor Smart Energy Switch which I brought outside and established its range was 95'. All three of these switches were very easy to pair with the Vera and work well in my home automation application. I subtract one star from the GE 45604 otherwise flawless performance due to it not having a light to indicate power to the outlet, a power button that is slightly difficult to work manually and concerns of rain shorting the circuit while an appliance is plugged into it. I have to believe there is a boot that could water proof the outlet when the appliance is in use. Otherwise the GE works well, has superior range and seals up nicely when nothing is plugged in making it ideal for an outside signal relay. At this point I am inclined to stick with GE outdoor modules on my future purchases.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Great Addition to the ADT Pulse,5.0 ,"This product is great. It was very easy to add to my ADT Pulse and is very versatile. I bought two of them when they were a little cheaper. I keep one programmed to turn on a table lamp every night just around sunset, I have them both programmed to randomly turn on/off lights when I travel and turn on lights in the event of a general alarm or a fire alarm. The unit has two outlets on it and it only covers one outlet on the wall plate when plugging it in. One outlet is the programmed side and the other is a constant open so plugging it in to your wall gives you three available outlets. All programming is done through the ADT Pulse website and there are a variety of options for days, times, and events for the unit to turn on/off. I can turn the unit on/off through the website, my phone or the push button. Finally, the programming does not just toggle the switch. It recognizes if the unit is on or off so if you turn it on manually at 6:45 and it is set to turn on 7:00, the Pulse will not send a toggle command. It recognizes it is on and there is no change. Nice feature, great product, far more reliable than the store bought power timers.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Fantastic pool switch for any smart home!,5.0 ,"What this device offers: -a clean, simple box to control multiple 120V or 240V devices -an interface with your smart home devices, which can allow remote control from anywhere -I have it connected with Wink, which allows me to turn the pool on or off with my voice, and has a schedule that will turn the system on and off automatically every day -Peace of mind knowing your pool isn't using electricity when it doesn't have to This device is worth every penny. It took me about 4 hours (including a couple trips to the hardware store to get some wiring parts I forgot) to set it up, including taking down the electrical box it replaced, but now I can fully automate my outdoor pool pump and salt chlorination system with one device! I found this looking for a better outdoor switch for my 240V Hayward SP pump and new salt chlorinator, which turn on and off together. Before this there was a two-gang box attached to the house which had a covered switch and an electrical outlet that was taped over, so this is a major improvement. Wiring could not be more simple. The four punch-out holes are well placed, although I wish there was one on the top of the box. I know that wouldn't work without making the box bigger, and it may interfere with the wifi antenna, so I understand where there isn't one. I have it mounted directly to brick, and it looks very clean and professional. The screw terminals for the wiring are very robust, and are easy to get to and identify with the clear plastic cover. I have two circuits come in on the left side (boxes right), with the 240V controlled by the box, and the 120 for the pool light passing through to another switch by the pool (which I plan on replacing with a smart switch as well). Connecting it to Wink took a bit of trial and error, as the product isn't listed verbatim in the Wink app, but by selecting a generic GE Z-Wave switch (I think it is the same as the other GE outdoor switch) I was able to have it connected in less than five minutes. Wireless Range seems good; my next closest Z-wave device is a few rooms and about 50' away, so it's nothing crazy, but have had no connectivity issues for two weeks. I have also set the Wink app to turn the pump on and off with a schedule, making it a very robust pool timer. The override button is also super convenient; a short travel tactile button turns the pump on or off when you need to clear the basket of debris, or change the filter, etc. The two lights are also a very clean and clear way to identify if the system works.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Loses connection and needs resetting too often.,4.0 ,"** see update below** While made well and encased in a hard plastic shell, as advertised, this device continuously hangs and loses connection with the zwave/Wink network rendering it's remote on/off capabilities and the scheduled on/off operation useless.

I had this device at the end of a long extension cord, with my pond pump plugged into it until I can get my underground line in. By moving the device to the outlet, and plugging the extension cord into it that goes to the pump the problem is solved.

Waste of time and money,1.0 ,"I purchased two of these to go with my security system. Setting them up with the security system was a breeze. The problem is: one would recognize a lamp and turn it off and on for me, but after that I would have to rearrange living room furniture, unplug it and plug it back in for it to work the next time, and then put all of the furniture back. That plug is in a ridiculous location, hence why I wanted it in the first place. The other one recognized a lamp once. One time. That's all. I could plug anything else into it and it would work, but not the lamps (bit of which at least worked with the other plug ...once...) and I wanted these for lamps so when the sunset is 4:45, I can come home to a light without leaving it on all day. As I don't enjoy paying so much for things that don't work like they're supposed to, I am returning both. Maybe sometime the technology will work in the future.

Problems with 2 out of 3,1.0 ,"BEWARE. Original Review, June 2012: I give this one star as an outdoor module. It doesn't connect reliably to my Homeseer and Z-Troller zwave network. I sent 2 back thinking they were defective and got 2 more. Same exact problem. After a lot of troubleshooting and frustration, I ordered the Intermatic Homesettings outdoor module. It looks very similar but is not the same when you see it in person. It is controlling my landscape lighting perfectly with no tinkering. This GE model has such great reviews that I'm wondering if it just doesn't like my house's concrete block walls. It is just outside the room where the controller is. Works inside the house, so I'm keeping 2 for inside use because you can't beat the price. UPDATE 12/3/12: I bought an extra to have on hand to use inside. Opened it today and it is DOA. 5 months Too late to send it back to Amazon. I checked JASCO's GE warranty page and there is no record of this item. $30 down the drain.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

"Unreliable, no support",1.0 ,"This review is regarding model 12726, the 40A 240-277V split phase model. Purchased July 30, 2017. Installed on August 3 on pool waterfall pump. Switching worked fine. kW and kW-hr readouts worked intermittently. The breaker at my electrical box tripped on September 10, 2017 and would not reset. Disconnected the switch from all wiring. Multimeter shows 0 resistance between input and output terminals. There is an internal short. It lasted 38 days in operation, and less than 100 switching events. Can't return to Amazon because the return period is only 30 days. Called Jasco, waited on hold for 20 minutes before being dumped into a voicemail box. Update 2017-Nov-6 I eventually did reach Jassco and they proved an RMA number. Emailed Jassco 4 weeks after the return was delivered to them. They said that the item was not in stock at that time. 2 weeks go by and I emailed them again. No response to that email. Will update if I ever receive a response. Update 2017-Nov-11 I finally got a response from Jassco that a replacement was on its way. Received but not installed yet. If it fails again I am going to put the pool waterfall back to its original configuration- Intermatic mechanical timer and 240V manual switch.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Terrible fumble by GE - switch is unusable with grounded plugs,1.0 ,"This product is worthless garbage if you want to use a grounded plug with it. The switch plugs in to the wall, and as advertised, allows you to use the bottom outlet in your wall receptacle. There are two outlets on the switch, but both of them have the ground prong *closest to the back of the switch* (toward the wall)...you cannot plug a standard grounded plug into this switch!

What a great light with easy setup.,5.0 ,"This is an awesome way to add a zwave bulb if you just can't figure out the light switch. I wasn't going to add a bulb that can potentially die out in a couple of years, however this should last quite sometime. My tenant is annoying with leaving the light on all night so I added a zwave bulb and connected to vera within 3 minutes. Pretty easy. Now I can turn it on a dusk and turn it off well whenever I want. :) The bulb comes with everything needed. They even added a little plastic clip that slides over the switch to keep it from being accident entry turned off manually. They truly were thinking when packaging this for the consumer. I'm thinking of buying more. Only time will tell if they last 22 yrs like it states. I don't need full 100 % illumination so it should get closed to 10. Anything less is a disappointment. Although these bulbs will probably be way cheaper in 10 yrs I just don't want to keep shelling out 25 bucks every yr for a light. This needs some kind of hub like vera just in case anyone is wondering. If this fails for any reason in the near future I will be sure to update my rating. I have not been paid nor do I work for the company that sells or manufacturers this product.

Varying Plug Design + Poor Range,2.0 ,"I purchased the GE Z-Wave outdoor plug to control my patio string lights via Smartthings control. Unfortunately, two factors forced me to return the unit. The main deal breaker was a straight plug vs. the 90 degree plug as depicted in the Amazon product picture. The plug was to be placed in an enclosed outlet box that required a 90 degree prong to fit and allow for closing of the box (gotta keep that water out). I made sure to check the product pictures on Amazon to make sure it was angled, which is what the current pictures show (see my uploaded photo). Unfortunately, there must be two different versions of the smart switch with either the straight or 90 degree plug and I got the former. Since it wouldn't work where I had initially planned, I had another spot in my yard for some other lights that I decided to try rather than returning the product. This is where I encountered the second issue, poor range. The new location for the switch was about 40 feet away from my Smartthings hub, going through two walls. The switch wouldn't connect/function at that distance. I tried it on an outlet about 15 feet closer (still outdoors) and it picked up just fine, so that extra open-air distance must be too much for the unit. You would think a product intended to be used outdoors would have a strong range, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I will be checking into the other options for an outdoor smart plug offered through Amazon.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
And you have to track down the controller and software - this is more like a GE con,1.0 ,"They do NOT tell you that to make this work you will have to buy a Z-wave controller (a variety of manufacturers and types work, nearly all over $50) then you will have to buy controller software (again mostly over $50) THEN you can use your smartphone or tablet to control your outdoor lights! So almost $50 switch actually costs near $150 to make it work as advertised! And you have to track down the controller and software - this is more like a GE con, sadly in this case seemingly aided by Amazon!","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
"Good, but tricky to initialize",3.0 ,"This works well once I was able to connect it to my SmartThings Hub, but getting it into a pairing mode was tricky. There is only 1 button, but you have to push it just hard and quick enough to turn on pairing. Push the button wrong and the device does nothing. You may think to yourself, how can you push a button wrong? I was there with you, and it took me quite a while of trial and error and head scratching before I finally got the first controlled to enter a pairing mode. The other 2 were a bit quicker, but still took a minute or more to just push the button right and have it turn on and pair. It would be better if they kept the manual override button and added a dedicated pen-push pairing button.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
GE Z-Wave Wireless Controller Doesn't live up to its advertising,1.0 ,"I got the GE Z-Wave controller to control lights in my office. It was very expensive. $100 total for the remote control and the device that plugs into an outlet. From one side of my office to the other is approximately 25 feet. The device is plugged in at a wall which is about 25 from the office door opening. If I stand outside the door and attempt to control the lights, it fails almost 100% of the time and mutiple attempts are required to turn lights off or on. Sometimes I have to walk into the office and stretch my arm out to make it work. Contrast this with three remote controllers I got from Home Depot for $15 at Christmas to control outside Christmas lights. They work just fine. No problem at all turning the lights on/off with any one of them. The GE Z-Wave advertises that it can control multiple devices at a distance of up to 100 feet. In my experience that is a lie. Originally, I thought that I could control my office lights from downstairs (office is on the second floor). That didn't work at all even though the distance was only about 50 feet max. Then I thought that I could leave the controller on a shelf outside of the office and turn off everything as I left the office or turn on everything when entering the office. That has not work either. I gave it one star for the excessive cost of a device that doesn't work as advertised. The cost isn't just the remote control, but also the device that plugs into the wall socket. Both were expensive. When I found that simple, inexpensive Christmas light remote controls worked fine for 15% of the cost, I felt taken by GE, a company with a big name that just doesn't live up to its reputation in this case. I highly recommend skipping this product and looking for something else.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Poor range?,1.0 ,"I got it to plug outside on my patio to control a string of LED lights out there. It's OK -- when it works. But it appears to constantly lose connection with the rest of my zwave mesh network. My Smartthings app is always showing that this device is ""not available."" Same thing with Alexa, she tells me it's currently not available. There's only the one button for manual on/off, and to pair with your hub. But it's confusing as each time I press it, it will just turn on and off. A third press (to pair) would just turn it back on again?? I'm going to try adding a Zwave Plus smart outlet somewhere nearby, to see if that will improve the range. I will update my review later.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

"1 year in and this never stops, great for christmas lights",5.0 ,"I have been using this with a SmartThings hub for over a year now and it has worked 100% of the time. It was first set up on some out door christmas decorations, but after the holidays I took it inside and hooked it to a string of christmas lights I left up in my house as nice evening lighting. Connecting to the hub was easy, and I have a schedule set to have it come on at sundown, and off at 10:30PM. This has worked every night with no missed times. This plug is kind of large so and they put the screw hole in a strange spot but it was working even in the real cold and snowy weather, where I have had some switch plugs fail when it is too cold. If you have an outdoor application for automation and a SmartThings hub this will work good. I do wish the plug was more protected or flush with the end but its good for my use.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Nice product - but not an angle plug as pictured,4.0 ,"The outdoor Z-wave timer from GE is a solid product. It feels like it is well made and ready to withstand rain, snow, sleet, ice, heat, and kids. I use them to control outdoor lighting like Christmas lights and deck lights. I also use them inside since they have a cord (vs. the interior ones which plug directly into the outlet). I bought it so I could use centralized timing from my SmartThings hub and ditch a series of manual, digital, photoelectric, and astrological timers that I had been using. My only beef is that the item pictured has a NEMA-90 plug on it (right angle plug) but the item actually doesn't. I've ordered a few of these and none of them are angled - all straight. Not sure what the deal is as everything else looks identical. Having a straight plug is a hassle since it makes it challenging to plug it into an outdoor continuous-use outlet cover which are required by code for this use case.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

It wasn't very far from my Zwave controller (smart things) but it would constantly drop off the network. I got another device using the same technology but not as waterproof and it works fine, I enclosed it in a plastic box to prevent any issues. I had to bring this right next to the hub to pair it, and even with a repeater between it and the main hub (which shouldn't have been required) it would keep dropping. I have other zwave products much further out than this was and they worked fine.

GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control,4.0 ,"Picked up this to control a living room table lamp with a Switch LED bulb. Using it with the Smartthings hub, it set up very easy and works pretty well. Since the bulb is dimmable it is nice to finally be able to use that feature of it. Using it with the Samsung app and Alexa it controls consistently and dims the light very well. My only complaint is a feature of this is to be able to cycle power on the lamp switch itself and have the light turn on instead of using the z wave to control it, but that does not work. The feature is disabled by default and you need a controller to enable it which makes no sense. Would be 5 stars if not for that but otherwise I am happy with it.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Good zwave controller for my pool pump - but sometimes has problems with wireless operation,3.0 ,I am using this product to control my pool pump while connected to my z-wave network. It is located not far away and almost line of sight from the zwave controller so I know its not the signal strength that causes issues. Pros: - Solid and waterproof enclosure. - Big button on front for easy manual operation. - Nice indicator lights on the front. - Nice terminals and and lots of space for easy wiring Cons: - Not reliable operation with zwave network - commands I send for on/of are sometimes not always executed. I'd say 90% of the times it works perfect by remote but the few times it does not place doubt so I have to double check now to make sure the pool pump truly turned on. - At times it is not being able to be seen by the network for no apparent reasons.,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
YOU HAVE THE POWER,5.0 ,"I bought this to replace a Intermatic P1121 Heavy Duty Outdoor Timer that was used to run an aeration pump for a pond. Having recently installed a Smartthings hub, it was nice to find a power outlet made for being outdoors that works with it. No problem with setup. The initial setup was done close to the Smartthings hub. Once acknowledged and in the system it was moved outside about 70 feet away. The signal only has to go through one wall and it's a straight shot between hub and outlet. Works good. Within the Smarthings app was able to schedule on/off times. I'm expecting this to last longer than the Intermatic.

SmartThings + Alexa,5.0 ,"I'm using this with a SmartThings hub + Alexa and it works great. By mounting it in the lower receptacle I actually gain a receptacle. The top one is not blocked, and this unit contains a z-wave outlet + pass-through outlet. The outlets are conveniently located on the ends of the unit so you plug in from the side when the unit is plugged into the wall. That works well in my application since I have it behind a nightstand which I want as close to the wall as possible. I'm using it for my wall-mounted bedside lamp which is just barely out of reach from bed. When I'm done reading, I now just ask Alexa to turn it off. The button on the front adds manual control to the outlet. The only gotcha is if someone doesn't understand the setup and turns the lamp off at the lamp switch.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Not useful with an adapter,3.0 ,"The switch works, and pairs fine with Z-Wave. I want to use it with Christmas lights that have an adapter (wall wart) at the end of the cord, but the socket of this GE light control is recessed, and I can't plug the adapter in directly. I need another short extension cord. It has a large rubber cover for the end, which I guess will help keep out water if nothing is plugged in, but they could have made that a cap, and still had the socket flush. Lots of things you'd want to plug into this will have adapters, and you should look for another controller if that's your application.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
"Reliable, and some nice touches",5.0 ,"This is a Z-Wave module. Meaning it requires a Home Automation system such as HomeSeer, Samsung SmartThings Hub, or Vera, and then can be used to turn devices on/off remotely. This review is of the appliance module - it switches on and off but doesn't dim, ideal for heaters, TVs, etc. The main alternative to this would be the Leviton DZPA1-1LW or something from Aeon; there are several clones of this unit by Go and Linear that, I presume, are the same item relabeled. So why get this rather than the others? After all, it's uglier and slightly larger. But... it is cheaper, it's reliable, and has two fantastic features... It has a pass-through; it plugs in (of course), providing a switched outlet on one side and an always-on outlet on the other side. So you may not need that power strip to provide another plug for another device. And it is sized/shaped to take less space in some layouts. The Leviton requires, including device cord, probably twice as much vertical space. Really, these are commodities.

"Plan on getting these for all the lamps - controls lights and appliances, repeats the z-wave signal for enhanced coverage",5.0 ,"In my household Someone is always leaving a lamp on in every room of our home; GE has come to the rescue with this nifty module! Someone also occasionally forgets to lock up before leaving our home. I now have these modules on the most used lamps in our home. I configured our Nexia account with a scene called ""Lock Up, Lights Out"". Now at scheduled times the program runs the scene which then locks up our home and switches the selected lamps to Off. I also created a scene called ""movie time"" which is very similar allowing the room to darken while we are watching tv. So nifty! Each of these powered modules also acts as a repeater, rebroadcasting the Z-Wave commands from device to device to enhance the overall Z-Wave network to be solidly reliable. Since installing and configuring a number of these lamp modules our Trane TZEMT400BB3NX N N SL Home Energy Management Thermostat with Nexia Home Intelligence, White (Z-Wave) has remained in perfect contact with the bridge control module thereby resolving the communication issue we previously encountered only having a single repeater on our system.

Works great with Amazon Echo and SmartThings hub to automate an outlet.,5.0 ,"I use this to control a 1700 watt dual boiler espresso machine with my SmartThings and Alexa devices. As stated, there are 2 outlets on this unit. Only one of them is 'smart' and the other is always active.

It was very easy to setup with SmartThings and Alexa. I just tell Alexa to ""Turn on Espresso"" and she takes care of heating up my machine so that when I get downstairs in the morning the device is warm and ready to brew. My machine, a Quickmill Vetrano 2B, takes a good 15 minutes to heat up both boilers so this smart controller ensures my machine is ready to brew when I finally get downstairs.

Great for Smartthings Control of Christmas Lights,5.0 ,"Over the past few years I've been working to turn our home into a ""smart home"". The one area I have not tackled, until now, has been outside. All of our indoor lights are controlled via our Smartthings Hub and various Z-Wave outlets and Zigbee lightbulbs. So this year when we put up our Christmas lights, and our solar powered outdoor plug died on us, I had to come up with a solution. The GE Z-Wave Outdoor control module was my choice. I purchased one for the front and back of our home and hoped for the best. Pairing was very simple. The Smartthings hub found them as a ""new device"" as soon as I plugged the modules in. After that it was just a matter of working them into our lighting scheme and our Christmas lights are now fully controlled from inside our home. It's great being able to set a very precise schedule for turning the lights on and off based on our needs, and having the flexibility and access without needing to physically be in contact with the lights. The construction of these modules seems pretty substantial. There's just one outlet on each and a plug to cover that outlet if it's not in use. The materials were a bit confusing as they state that these should not be used outside in very in-climate weather, yet they're outdoor modules. Shouldn't they be able to withstand a good rain storm? Blizzard? I am going to take the chance and use them all holiday season regardless of the weather situation and see what happens. The module out back is not protected from the elements in any way, but the front one is under our porch cover.

Great for home security!,5.0 ,"I have a self-install security system, but one that is actively managed by a third-party company (like ADT). I purchased the lighting control as it connects with a number of systems, control panels and third-party software that uses Z-Wave technology. My intent was to use this device to allow me to remotely control lights while we're away to give the appearance that someone is home. The installation was quite simple. I plugged it in, called the third-party security company, and they provided instructions for how to sync the control panel with the lighting control. From there, it showed up on the app (alarm.com), and worked great. You should know; however, that if you're thinking this will work without some sort of receiver/control panel, believe you may be mistaken. In the beginning, I thought this would work just fine with some third-party app, but I believe you must also use their receiver box in the event it doesn't sync with your security system control panel. I believe it's referred to as a ""gateway"". A number of companies offer them.

When I installed the unit and went through the process to connect it to my Z-Wave network, it showed up immediately on my Android Smartthings App and just worked. The unit provides you both power (Watts) and Kilowatt hours, and also has external status lights so you can immediately tell if AC power is flowing into unit and if power is flowing to the load (hot water heater). As I stated, I installed it using 220 VAC with 10 awg wire. Unit came with very clear instructions, and had no issues at all. Instructions show multiple connections for 120VAC, 220VAC, single load and dual load. The case is solid metal and looks very well made. It is also weather resistant. This unit gives me peace of mind that I can turn ON/OFF the hot water heater to either save money or control it when I'm away on vacation.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Great Budget Switch to add to non-essential rooms,5.0 ,"For its current pricing, it is a great addition to any Z-Wave enabled smart home. It does use the older Z-Wave technology, but pairs seamlessly with my Wink Hub 2. This device has an ""Always On"" side and a controllable side. So you are only able to turn on and off the device plugged into the controllable. This isn't terrible, as there are many applications that can require an always on, non-controllable port. However, in my house I would prefer to have both controlled. Another great features is the fact that it can extender your Z-Wave signal. With some strategic placing of this device, you can get a good signal all throughout your home. If you are looking for the newer version, I would highly suggest you look into the GE 28177 or the GE 28175 (Dimmable). Both of these come with two controllable sides, USB charging port, and Z-Wave Plus technology. All-in-all, for a budget, this is a great product. Especially for guest rooms and non-essential rooms.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Works as expected and pairs with ADT Pulse.,5.0 ,"I installed this unit as a water heater timer for my home. I followed the instructions and the install went as expected. I paired the unit with the ADT Pulse system and it paired instantly. Since it has the ability to monitor energy use, ADT Pulse now provides a graph of my Water Heater's energy use, per hour, in the history section of the ADT portal. Now I can turn off the heater when we set the alarm to AWAY or Vacation mode. I calculated this unit will pay for itself in about 7 months in energy savings. I like the external button as that makes it easy for other family members (eg Wife) to turn on the water heater if they need to use the unit on a off-period. Also the LED lights are a nice touch to tell my family members if the water heater is on. I will probably buy 2 more of these units to replace a couple manual timers we use for outdoor lighting.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Goes offline with every power flicker and must be reset.,1.0 ,"Endlessly goes off line and must be reset with Wink hub 2. It enters reset mode by applying and removing power to the bulb. That’s a problem, because if you live in an area where storms or other issues cause power to flicker in storms or when the electric utility preforms maintenance all of these lights will turn on then go off line. To place them back in service, the need to be removed from what ever fixture there in and plug them in next to the Wink hub, them begin a process of reprogramming that works about 60 % of the time. Then you need to clean up the Wink network, Google home or Alexia by removing the old entries for the bulbs. What was needed is a button on the bulb to enter programming mode. By relying on the power on/off method to enter the programming mode they made a high maintenance monster that sooner or later you’ll come to the conclusion is just not worth the trouble of resetting again so it can rejoin the network.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
DIED IN 5 MONTHS - But Jasco Sent new ones,4.0 ,"UPDATE, SEPT. 21, 2016: Well, it worked great ... for almost five months. Went to turn off my lamp this week and heard a loud pop. Thought the bulb burned out. This morning, turns out the wireless outlet on this device died. However, manufacturer Jasco sent replacement after 15 minute phone wait ... (hoping it was just a fluke) MAY 2016: Bought a couple of these and connected to 2 lamps in the house so that we could control and program to automatically turn on during vacations. Works great! Only thing to know is that the fixture plugged in to this device must be ON in order to control it remotely (duh). TIP: If you turn the lamp on and off during regular use, you have to remember to turn it on before you leave for vacation-mode use. Works similarly to the LED light bulbs, but you can use this device for more than one item at a time, and for different types of fixtures.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Nexia/SmartThings,3.0 ,"This thing work as a contactor only, expensive for that purpose. But with zwave capabilities, then it's worth it (only if I can get to connect with nexia). This thing doesn't connect at all, been trying multiple times with no success. Even got a replacement from Amazon but same problem. I went to Home Depot and bought a SmartThings hub to see if it is the switch. Still no connection, so not sure now. My nexia is working fine and the SmartThings hub working fine.

Lights are still powered when the switch is off - Current leak is unacceptable,1.0 ,"The device connected fine to my Z-wave hub and was responded appropriately most of the time. I have noticed a response time of a few seconds sometimes which may be due to the distance between the switch and the hub. What I found unacceptable is the fact that when the switch is off, there is still some current delivered (about 2.2v). I have noticed it at night when my LED were showing a faint light. I guess many users may not notice, but this is a waste of money and energy. I like the concepts of home automation, but draining energy when switches are off is not appealing. I have tested two of these items and they both have this issue.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
You can reset your router!,5.0 ,"This switch was the perfect solution for schedule a router reset every night! I've paired this up with a Samsung Smarthub V2 and it allows me to schedule a router reset everynight. You may be wondering how does it reset the router if there is no internet when it's cut off? Well, the smart hub has batteries in it which allow it to remain connected to the Z-Wave devices! The only difficulty I encountered was pairing this. I had to put the hub in exclusion mode (it magically connected by itself) and then I was able to pair it as normal.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
"Great addition to the Z-wave lineup. Weatherproof Z-wave module, note, it's on and off only, no dim.",5.0 ,"This is great.

This one has a heavy duty weatherproof cord. It's designed to hang down, just as the picture shows. That keeps the water dripping off and not onto the plug and into the module.

Instead I set that to always on, plugged it into this control in my boiler room, and through zwave can turn it on whenever I want. Using OpenHAB on Raspberry Pi, was very easy to add to zwave network, set up a rule to have it turn on every morning, and another rule so that whenever I turn it on manually, it turns itself off in 10 minutes.

Affordable smart plug!,4.0 ,I like the fact that it has two outlets one on each side it's very easy to set up and it's very reliable I've never had it not turn on or off. Works great with the Wink Hub even though others may say otherwise. Some of the cons are that I don't like the way it will partially block your other plug on your outlet when the module is plugged in so that's kind of a drawback also only one of the plugs on the module is for Z wave the other one is just a standard plug that cannot be controlled it would be nice of both of them were Z wave controllable,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Works well,5.0 ,"I've purchased four or five of these things to complement my 90+ ZWave devices throughout my house and property. They work well and seem to have good range. FWIW, the latest one purchased is now plugged in-line with my garage door opener power cord because I found that potential crooks have been driving around the neighborhood during the day with devices that try all 10,000 garage door opener codes to see whose garage they can open up, to mark for a subsequent theft. This way, I can completely disable the opener. It's now a three-step process (all automated via a MicasaVera ""scene"") to turn on this device to power the motor, two seconds later press the ""unlock garage"" button (which is a GarageDoorLock device that controls another Zwave relay on the garage door button, coordinated with a Zwave garage door open/close sensor), and finally15 minutes later turns off this device again to remove power. The 15 minutes is plenty of time for me to get in my car, back it out of the garage, then use the normal garage door opener remote control button on my visor to close the door again. When coming home, I have to open the garage using my cellphone, with the ""Home Buddy"" app, to trigger the garage door open scene. Again, the power is left on for 15 minutes so that I can close the door with the regular garage push-button before entering the house. OK, that's a lot more information than anyone really needed to know. Suffice it to say that this GE Z-Wave controller works well, even way out on the garage ceiling.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Not ready for prime-time,1.0 ,"With a name brand product like GE, I had expected a product with adequately simple setup, instructions, ease of use and a basic level of customer support. I found none of these. It came packaged well, with a single page instruction sheet (three pages total, but only a page for each language). First, I bought this to use with the WINK hub, and on the package, it has the wink app ready symbol, so I expected it to work and be supported. The wink app doesn't support this product, so the easy setup isn't so easy. It can be added as a generic zwave switch, but the information and feedback from the app on how to do it and when is very limited, which is understandable, since Wink doesn't support it, they don't have specific instruction and troubleshooting in the app like they do for setup of most of their supported products (generic instructions for generic switch, ok...). However, the instructions with the switch are virtually non existent, so a supposedly simple setup failed after dozens of attempts (long press, single press, reset the hub, etc..) I asked Wink, they said to factory reset the switch, ""it should say how in the instructions"". NOPE, the instructions contain little information about the process of pairing, resetting (turns out you can't), or troubleshooting. Jasco, the maker of the product (under contract for GE I guess?) took 2 days to respond to a support request, and then only to say what amounted to ""it's not our problem, talk to Wink"". In the end after 3 days of attempts, I was able to pair it to the wink hub, thanks to Wink for figuring out someone else's product and helping me make it work. This product was intended to be used to control an automatic chicken coop door on a schedule, with the option of manually switching as necessary. The push button doesn't feel very sturdy, and time will tell, but given the overall experience with the company, this switch and the interaction with my controller, I don't feel it to be a reliable solution, so I may ultimately move to a different product. In all, I would avoid this product in the future, given the seeming lack of reliability, poor customer service, poor instructions, lack of troubleshooting, and difficulty in pairing. Update: After a couple of weeks of use, after finally successfully pairing, the switch intermittently fails to function. I don't think the issue is with the Wink server, as the app shows the properly scheduled change of state, but the switch hasn't actuated. Given this is used to control the chicken door, to let them out each morning and close them in at night, particularly if we are away, intermittent failure is not acceptable. It may be an issue with distance to hub, and environmental conditions, (roughly 30ft, through one wall) and the low relative power of zigbee vs zwave? In any case It doesn't meet basic expectations that an automated switch can work reliably, automatically. I'd try troubleshooting, but the maker (as described above) clearly doesn't feel accountable to the end-user, so I'll be returning it, and looking for alternatives","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

"It's ""plug and play""!",5.0 ,"I bought two. These modules are my 7th type of zwave device since I began installing them in July 2016 (SmartThings v2). If you don't want to install an in-wall device, maybe just need a temporary solution, or are just adding a zwave 'repeater' to a difficult area this device should be on your list. One 'feature' which I didn't notice when initially researching these, but did find before I bought any, is that only one outlet is zwave and one is 'normal'. I wasn't sure if this was what I wanted/preferred or not but that's the way they are and I've had no issues. After having these installed for 2 months now they've worked flawlessly. Set up/pairing was straightforward as well. One thing I like to mention in my zwave device reviews is this... I'm sure some people have unique situations but for the most part I believe that most problems encountered with zwave connectivity is the range. I've made sure that I have at least one device no further than 15 feet from the next device, more of then and closer as much as possible. Keep your mesh network nice and tight and build out from your hub. I have had ZERO issues now after 6 months with approx 20 devices covering sockets, switches, water sensor, garage door opener/sensor.

In what sense is this an outdoor plug?,1.0 ,"Bought this to remotely control an outdoor water fountain. Knew I was going to return it the instant I read the instructions. Although it states that the unit is ""suitable for outdoor use in damp locations"" it then says: ""do not expose to rain."" It also states that it should be installed at least 3 ft above the ground. This might be OK if it had a cord longer than 6"", but it doesn't and 3 ft off the ground is not exactly standard placement for electrical conduits, at least not in my backyard. A further annoyance is that it requires a hub to work. I knew it required a hub to interface with Alexa but I didn't realize it needs a hub to work with my iPhone. Most smart plugs like TP-Link connect to my iPhone instantly without a hub for half the price.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O
Unreliable,1.0 ,"I easily paired this to my Samsung Smart Things Hub and plugged in one set of string lights. I set up routines for automatic on and off times and was able to turn the lights on and off with the app. After that, the routines worked very sporadically, but mostly the app said the device was unavailable. I'll note that the one other device I have on my Smart Things Hub is always available and it is always dependable (a smart plug for a fan). That's actually true for all of my other Smart Home products - Nest, Hue, August, Ecobee, Echo. I exchanged the first one I had because I thought it was defective, but this one does the same thing. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but I can't depend on it to work and basically it mostly doesn't work unless I go outside and push the button to reset it, but then it might or might not fail again before the time that the lights are set to go on or off again. I'm returning this one and trying an IDevice, which is more expensive, but it has 2 plugs and it is compatible with Apple Home Kit (yay). I am really disappointed that GE is producing this inferior product, but I was getting ready to order a more complicated GE device to run our pool equipment, etc. so I'm glad I got the warning that GE isn't up to Smart Home yet with this little device.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Reminder: only 1 of the plugs is Zwave enabled...but it works!,5.0 ,"OK, product works so that is important. Connected to Wink. Easy. Love the offset application when you plug it in so the bottom plug can still be used. Also having 2 outlets is a great idea... The only thing that surprised me was I expected both outlets (on either side of the adapter) to be Zwave controlled. That is not the case - ONLY 1 plug is Z wave controlled for your lamp and the other outlet is NOT. That is most likely on me, probably overlooked it or misread the fact that 1 was a grounded (3 holes) outlet and one wasn't. I wanted to control 2 lamps at once that sit on a sofa table and this was a perfect option, so I thought. But keep in mind - it works perfectly and is represented correctly - just if you happen to have the same application that I was looking for, this adapter will only enable 1 side to be Zwave controlled. I will simply use it on another single lamp and all will be good. I am giving it 4 stars ONLY because I would like to have an option available from this product where I could control 2 plugs at the same time.....on second thought that really isn't fair to the product or the seller...I'll change it to 5 star and look forward to finding an adapter that can control 2 lamps at the same time.","GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720",B0013V8K3O

Works great with the Wink Hub. Be sure you have the space to plug it in,4.0 ,I use this to control my outside cafe lights and Christmas lights. It paired with my Wink Hub just fine and it controls them well. The only issue is that it a three prong plug that plugs in at a 90 degree angle. This makes it difficult to put into some outside wall outlets that have a weatherproof cover on them or are recessed.

Does it's job.,5.0 ,"I have 2 models in this listing, the appliance module and the outdoor module. My indoor appliance module is a little disappointing, it does seem to work properly, but doesn't seem to report back to the SmartThings hub what the switch status is. It appears that it will turn on if load is removed and replaced, but this will require more testing on my part and is not mentioned in the documentation. My outdoor module is controlling 2 48"" Fluorescent tubes. It works wonderfully and reliably.

READ before buying this!,1.0 ,"I've had 99.5% satisfaction with all Amazon orders. But this purchase made me see RED! After the large font description of this item, Amazon added (also in large font): ""works with Alexa Echo"". As I already had an Echo and 6 Phillips Hue smart bulbs, I bought this because I wanted a bulb with more lumens than my A19's. Yes, I should've read the numerous small print lines of text following ""see more"", but I trusted Amazon that the ""headline"" was accurate not deceptive. After spending 45 minutes on the phone with an Amazon rep who was stymied by my bulb not working with Alexa, followed by 10 minutes of talking to HIS supervisor, I was finally told: Contact the manufacturer, which I did. Mfr. quickly told me this bulb is only compatible with Alexa Echo if used with a WINK HUB. Why should I spend $69 - $80 for a WINK hub when I already have a Phillips hub? All this could have been avoided if the description of item stated clearly up front that there were conditions under which Alexa was not compatible. I'm stuck with a bulb with no smart control OR sending it back! The fault lies in Amazon's deceptive description of item.

I had to use my own mounting screws onto the rack, they weren't included) As far as power, I have 3 dual socket workstation class machines; with this unit it is projecting 40 minutes of runtime with battery. It also has a nice feature of the secondary battery group, that allows small blips of power to keep everything running, and longer downtimes to keep the critical stuff still going. The frontend display has three very important pieces of information; kw usage, capacity, and projected backup time. This is great to see as I was hooking up the unit so I could make sure I wasn't putting too much onto the machine. I just got it, but, so far, I think its a winner.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S
UPS killed my UPS,3.0 ,"Its a really nice and heavy unit. The biggest you can get with out upgraded wiring. I believe in over kill when it comes to electrical power. I never like to get near the maximum load ratings. I try to keep loads around 50% to 60% of ratings. But it arrived damaged. The front panel was broken in transit. Amazon is sending out a replacement. But until the replacement arrives I can't add much more So far all I can say is it looses 2 stars for aggravation, delay in setup and packaging. When I called Cyberpower about the damage the Rep. with attitude said that the pancaking meets or exceeds the standards. Obviously those ""standards"" are inadequate and do not take UPS drivers in to account. The CyberPower Rep. also warned that if it took that strong an impact the unit might also have internal damage making it unsafe to use. I will update when I receive the replacement. With the recent storms both I and my parents have taken power hits and had some damages as a result. I also ordered a second unit sent to my parents. I am hoping when I go to set it up this weekend it will have arrived in good condition. They need it to protect the computer equipment, router and most importantly the cable/VOIP-phone modem and phone attached to it. For safety they must have at least 1 working phone when the power goes out. Gone are the days of the old POTS Land Line phones. now everything needs power to work. UPDATE: 11/05/12 The second unit I order arrived in good condition!! The package containing the rack mount rail kit had burst open but no damage to the UPS. Better yet no scratches from the rails bouncing around in the box. The UPS is to heavy for the high shelf I have the equipment on so I have it temporarily setup until I can do some rearranging and cable management. I have the network switch, NAS etc. plugged in to the critical outlets. I have the router and cable modem plugged in to the noncritical outlets. That way I can use the installed rmcard202 network card and web interface to cycle the noncritical outlets to reset the router and cable modem when needed with out running all the way down to the basement back closet. The web interface has its limitations but will do what I need it to. The drawback is with the router and modem on the noncritical outlets I can not set up priority and shut that bank down to conserve battery during an outage. I have yet to play with the included software. I have only explored the embedded web interface so far. I have tested wit a simulated ""unplugged"" a power outage the Qnap ts-659-proII NAS shutdown as configured with a USB connection. The NAS must be rebooted once the USB cable is connected for the NAS to recognize the UPS. The UPS is reporting a NAS only load of between 5% and 7% The display is rotatable as mentioned in other reviews take care with the ribbon cable. I had difficulty rotating the display no slack at all. I found the cable was kinked and pinched under the front panel. I loosened the 6 screws holding the front panel on remove it and had all the slack needed to easily rotate the display. The power button safety cover is very difficult to open with my sausage fingers. UPDATE: 11/15/12 The replacement arrived the other day in good condition witch is amazing considering the large gash and boot print in the box. So far I just have them temporally situated with the critical devices. They are heavy and the rats nest of cables is going to be a challenge and an all day task to retie and make look pretty again. But so far so good. The real test will be the next time there is a power event.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S

Wow !!,5.0 ,"This thing is a beast. It's big, it's HEAVY it's sort of ugly. Oddly enough they delivered a (other brand) 1500 VA ups to me at work today. That one is maybe 1/5 the weight of this one. It looks a lot nicer. It costs about as much. If you want pretty and small, look at other models. This one is rated to hold up a full load for a while. The little guy at work might last a minute at 1500 VA. There's 5X the batteries in this one. I can't imagine what else you would want in a UPS other than a built in ethernet control rather than an optional one. There is every other form of alarm and i/o you would ever want already on this. It'll handle cable and Ethernet suppression along with UPS duties. It comes with a full set of rack mount rails and handles if you want to mount it that way. There's some interesting chat about the watt ratings on this beast. If you go to the manufacturer's web site, it's rated at 1500 VA *and* 1500 W when running on batteries. More or less, if it doesn't blow the fuse, you can depend on this UPS to handle your load. Power factor does not matter. Since most ""stuff"" these days is power factor corrected, it's the watt ratings rather than the VA ratings that matter. One other note - the nice looking feet in the picture are not the feet that come with the unit. What you get is a metal plate assembly and some tiny screw on rubber feet. Very sturdy, not very pretty.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S
Battery Capacity drops to 80% immediately,4.0 ,"Just got this 3 weeks ago, and pulled the plug (breaker switch in house circuit breaker) and was shocked to see the battery capacity drop to 80% immediately on a 15% load! Further dropped to 60% in two minutes, while all the while continuing to report >60 minutes runtime on the load. Not sure what is going on here, but has anyone else actually tried the cutover to the battery and see anything similar? [Update] Feb 19, 2013: I gave this 1-star originally, but after contacting support and calibrating the UPS myself, it seems the immediate drop in % is ""normal"", i.e run times originally predicted still hold true, but while the UPS is on battery, the voltage drops as soon as power is drawn and the % drops quickly as mentioned above to 80%. However, after that the % drops linearly. P.S. it is LOUD when on battery!","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S

2 Units Broken on arrival!,1.0 ,"I've had 2 replacements so far. Both of them were damaged. One had the front faceplate smashed in, the other had the rear outlets smashed in. I'm not sure if this was done during shipping or at the cyberpower factory. The dents looked as if it left the factory that way, which makes me even more concerned on the quality of the unit. The packaging of the item was well protected. Wish I could comment on the actual usefulness of the UPS. But it seems to be nearly impossible to receive a working unit. Extremely disappointed in both CyberPower and Amazon.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S
This is the best one I have ever had,5.0 ,"I have been using for more than 4 years and it still works well. Just replaced the batteries for the first time even though they still were holding a charge. Through the years I have used at lest 25 battery backups. I normally have at least 10 running at any given moment for TV's lights etc. This is the best one I have ever had. It is quiet, and with the clean sine wave when I lose power my devices don't make buzzing noises unlike my non pure sine wave battery backups. I have read some negative reviews about this item however mine has been great. Some of negative reviews say it is loud, mine is almost silent. If I lose power and it kicks on it becomes a lot louder but that is normal. All my battery backups get loud when I lose power. That is because the fans have to go fast enough to cool the inverter when it is in use.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S
Nice UPS - Good Price - Noisy Inverter,4.0 ,"The Chinese made (see photo) ""CyberPower PR1500LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave Green UPS - 1500VA/1125W AVR LCD SNMP/HTTP XL (Black)"" arrived in a solid, well engineered box (see photo). The gross weight of the box is 42 Kg/92.5 lbs (see photo). On the whole, the unit appears attractive and well made as there were no noticeable blemishes and flaws on the finish and surface of the unit. In short, the product projects the appearance of having been assembled in a factory with well define processes and quality control measures. On the electrical rating of the unit itself, I find the manufactures claim of 1125 watts of net output power a bit disingenuous. According to the affixed manufacturers electrical label, the device is UL rated to draw 12 Amps at 125 VAC or 1500 VA for a net output of 1125 Watts (see photo) with 75% efficiency. That works out to a total of 1440 VA at the wall plug and 1080 watts for a typical 120 VAC house and only 1320 VA and 990 watts for a house running on 110 VAC. Maybe they exist, but I don't know of any house that is operating at 125 VAC. Hence, presuming normal load and source conditions, it would be more forthright to advertise this device with a maximum output rating of 990-1080 Watts at 110-120 VAC. The CyberPower PR1500, though called a ""UPS"" by name, is in fact not a true UPS and uninterrupted. This product, by electrical design, is not a double conversion device and therefore has a transfer time up to 6 milli seconds. A true UPS, with double conversion circuitry (AC-DC-AC) has zero transfer time and truly uninterrupted with AC line lost. But, because of noise levels, electrical efficiency issues and popular perception, CyberPower, APC and other manufactures include devices such as this under the heading of UPS. The set up and configuration instructions are incomplete and uses very small hard to read type. Also no hard copy of the manual is supplied. The only manual available is one that can be down loaded or obtain from the supplied CDROM. Not all of my power backup applications are near a computer(s) and to presume so or to disregard other applications is a bit near sighted. As for tech support, twice this week I called the phone number listed on the company web site during normal working hours (1:30pm CST) and the phone rang for several minutes with no one answering. Although not mentioned in the instructions, the front LED display block can be removed and rotated (see photo) to accommodate horizontal and vertical placement. To rotate the LED display block, one has to insert a flat tip (standard) screw driver into a small slot (see photo) and gently and carefully lift and extract the display block. The display block is attached in the rear with a ribbon cable to the face panel so be careful not to extend this part too far. Somewhat disappointing, given today's technology and ease to set, but the displayed input voltage is off by +2 VAC as per a Fluke 187 DVM. The on/off switch has a plastic protective flip cover (see photo) to prevent accidental cycling of the AC source. This is a nice hardware feature and one that I feel other manufactures would do well to adopt. The unit comes with a 10 foot power cord with the AC prongs set in a protective plastic sheath (see photo). Batteries were fully charged on arrival. As an observation, during the power cycle/transfer test and yet to be quantified, I noticed that the CyberPower PR1500 produces more inverter, cooling fan noise and vibration than the combined effect produced by an APC SU1400RM2U and SU2200RM2U sine wave units I have protecting an audio system. That's because the inverter fan in the CyberPower PR1500 is not a variable speed fan and operates at full speed at all times the inverter is functioning. Though minor, at the rear of the unit, the space between the ether cable (line out) and the AC power cord grommet (see photo) is too tight. Even though I have small hands, I still found it necessary to use a flat tip device to depress the plastic ether cable release tab to disconnect the ether cable. This clearance problem could be alleviated if the chassis designers were to rotated the ether ports in their mounts by 180 degrees, placing the ether cable depression release tab opposite to that of the power cord grommet. Included is a set of rack mount ears (see photo), pseudo dovetail, sliding rail kit (see photo) and shoes/chock (see photo) for freestanding. The steel rails and slides are of the non roller bearing type but still very functional. The two supplied plastic shoes for setting up the UPS in the vertical orientation can be separated (see photo) into four separate chocks for setting up the device in a horizontal non rack mount placement. For a heavy product, not having to be flush with the resting surface can be very helpful such that one can get their fingers underneath the unit for easer lifting. The CyberPower PR1500 came supplied with a full complement of cables (see photo), two 9 pin serial cables, one USB 2.0 cable, one RJ-11 telephone cable, one RJ-45 CAT5 ether cable along with a CDROM containing the management software. Last, a three display workstation (23"", 24"", 22"") with an Intel i7 860 CPU, 8GB DDR3, XTC Memory Cooler, Radeon 5850, NEC USB3.0/SATA6 PCIe, AVer HDTV PCIe, 2TB RAID 01, 1.5 TB eSATA HD, Scythe Fan Controller, 3X 120mm fans, 3x 100mm fans, Ultra 600W PS, BT, GB ether hub, speaker bar drawing a total of 304Ws as per the UPS, reports having an estimated run time of 44 minutes with fully charged batteries. Minus 0.25 for how the UPS output is electrically rated. Minus 0.25 for high noise level of the AC inverter sub system. Minus 0.25 for incomplete and too small a print used on the instructions. Minus 0.25 for not supplying a hard copy of the user manual.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S

Solid,5.0 ,"I have owned around 10 Battery Backup systems, this one puts them all to shame. Love how this comes with the hardware in the box that allows you to setup it up for a rack or on the floor setting on its edge with feet. The LCD can rotate to match your install so you can few the settings properly. I also picked up the CyberPower RMCARD202 Remote Management Card, this will allow me to remote in form anywhere and reset my network if needs be. Wished the Card came with the unit, but for how this UPS is priced its a great deal and value and the extra $130 still make this one of the best deals. Loved using my prime to get free shipping on a heavy UPS, though they don't allow two days on this. I have 5 dell PowerConnect 24 port switches, a 5 Drive NAS, Comcast and DSL Modems, a Router, a Firewall, and a Cisco Aoronet Access Point. This unit will provide over an hour of battery power for all of those devices allowing our office generator to kick on and take over at that point. In reality I only need 10 - 15 mins. Also is the largest unit you can use on a 15 amp plug.

Defective unit,1.0 ,"Received my pR1500LCDRTXL2U and it's defective. When I plug it into AC power and turn it on, I get a quick beep and a long beep. The UPS stays on for a few minutes, in those minutes I determined that the UPS was incorrectly detecting an under voltage condition. Here's a paste from the PowerPanel page: Input Status Under Voltage Voltage 76.0 V Frequency 60.10 Hz Model PR1500LCDRTXL2U Firmware Version 4.3.5 UPS Type Sinewave Line Interactive Power Rating 1500 VA / 1500 W Current Rating 12.0 Amp Voltage Rating 120 V Frequency Rating 47~53 / 57~63 Hz Just for fun, I tried several outlets, including my washing machine outlet which is on its own 30A circuit. Same results. Obviously, if my electrical service was only providing 76V as indicated by the UPS status, nothing would be working in my apartment. But this isn't the case. The UPS is wrong. Just to verify this, I measured the voltage with my multimeter (see picture). I put in a Support request with CyberPower with all the details, but so far haven't heard back from them. I'm hoping that it can be repaired, and that I won't have to return it, since the thing and accessories in its box is 90lbs and would be a BIG pain to haul down to a shipping facility. Awaiting response from CyberPower. (Note that the picture shows the multimeter plugged into a power strip which I used just for convenience. The UPS was plugged directly into a wall socket).","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S
Don't buy it!,1.0 ,"CyberPower PR1500LCDRTXL2U . I bought this item and installed on Oct 1, 2010 for my home entertainment system. The items we had connected to the Critical outlet were the HD television, Dishnetwork receiver, and a Yamaha Receiver. The HD TV has a fan that runs on the bulb for 2 minutes after it is shut off {Sony} to cool it down. And if the power is disconnect from the Dishnetwork receiver it goes through a reboot program that lasts from a few minutes to 10 minutes, even if the power goes off for a second! So if your watching TV and there is a power loss you are going to miss a large part, or if you are recording you will lose everything after the power goes off even for a split second. First I would like to say this item appears to work as described. When the power went off or we had a brown-out it would kick right in. But, I don't see how anyone could watch television or listen to music with the sound level of the cooling fans! My wife has an 1800 watt hair dryer that makes less noise. This CyberPower system is REALLY LOUD! We would turn it off or leave the room when it came on! Ok, here is the really bad part. Like another user giving a review here this unit kicked on last Monday morning at 3:AM. The LOUD FANS and beeping woke me up so I went in the living room and turned it off. The next morning I tried to turn it on with no luck. I left it plugged in with nothing on for about 10 hours and tried to turn it on again with no luck. I took the top cover off and checked the voltage to the circuit board and it was 120 volts. I pulled the battery pack out and checked voltage of all 4 batteries {I disconnected batteries one at a time while checking} and each battery had 13.4 volts. {fully charged}. I checked the switch and it was OK. From these tests and others I did indicates a bad circuit board. I called tech support at CyberPower and the first thing the guy said was the batteries are bad! After I explained that I had checked the batteries and what the result was, he basically said I have a $600.00 paper weight! So, I called back today and got a different guy with the same result. I ask if I could buy the circuit board from them or somewhere else and he said no. Every thing checks out good but the small 6""x 6"" circuit board. I think this is the worst review I have posted at Amazon. I would not buy again! My background: I use to teach a Specialized Electronics class for General Motors. I have worked on computers since 1992. I have installed a partial solar system at my home. {Used to charge our home phone system, cell phones, rechargeable AA & AAA batteries, and every other item that is rechargeable. It also basically runs out video security system too.}.

Excellent UPS and a Value Price point in its Class with Benefit of Safe Modular Enclosure. Fan Noise. Beep requires wire snip.,5.0 ,"Bought this in Sep 2013. It is now Dec 2013. We just had an ice storm...a lot of power fluctuations and today we had a second outage for about an hour and forty minutes. Last night I operated this from the simple software downloadable from the Cyberpower site onto my Windows 7 laptop. I put the unit into a test mode. I have one EBM hooked up. I have disabled the alarm from the s/w. You cannot do it from the front panel as I had hoped. However, There is STILL an Alarm that goes beep beep every few minutes, while the fan whirs. The trade off is you DO have real power. Last night I had to abort the test. It indicated I had 10 hours and 52 minutes of runtime. The load was about 80 watts, this includes a robust desk set up with most appliances off, just like I would do in an outage. However, I left the laptop powered up. After hours of the annoying beep (which I probably will open the unit and snip the wire in time to get rid of that sound. I recommend that anyone not familiar with electricity not to fool around inside these units. There is high voltage and current present and I am sure you could get injured if you do not know what you are doing. Never open it with it plugged into the wall and know that if you intend to do what I am contemplating that you cannot touch capacitors, etc and should have one hand behind your back and likely use an insulating glove (for electrical work). Goggles are also recommended. Even sealed Lead Acid Batteries may leak some acid or hydrogen. I do not endorse fooling around inside the units. I am a EE and may do this however. But, the noise is mostly annoying to the woman I share the house with. When I first hooked it up, I put the HP 4 Laserjet hog on it. Honestly, it was within specifications, but I thought momentary peak current draws would cause a problem. Nothing. Ran fine without a glitch. They DO tell you not to hook laser printers up. But, I am going to tell you that there is a good chance you could be fine. The main reason not to do it is that you are going to burn through your run time. Now I decided to get greedy and see what would happen if I connected the Microwave to it...we did have power out. The microwave started clearly power starved, struggled and the Cyberpower UPS unit took itself offline obviously due to an overload condition. The microwave draws 1500 Watts...and sure it would have been gravy if that actually ran. It did not and that is within spec. You are not supposed to use motors with these. However, I have a work around I am going to experiment with and will let you know. There is a box intended for audio, video and live performances. It is the most economical box that Furman sells that does Power Factor Correction, which is Impedance matching to maximize power transfer to the equipment from the wall socket. I intend to put this between the output of this type of unit...and momentary high current peak power draw devices. The unit is call the Furman P-1800 and runs about 400 USD or less now on Amazon. I have one on order. The units benefit is in its instantaneous current resorvoir (internal Capacitor) to in this application prevent surges from overloading the Cyber Power UPS unit by responding to these instantaneous current draws with capcitative stored energy. It will not take care of an RMS overload condition. In other words, this will not solve connecting a microwave to this. But, you are NOT supposed to connect a microwave or a refrigerator to even the unit that is above this (i.e., the CyberPower PR2200LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS 2150VA 1650W SNMP/HTTP Rack/Tower). I mention all of this because I am going to explore that next. I am looking to build up another stronger batter UPS for some kitchen appliances with the Current Draw supply circuit of the P-1800 in between. Right now this is a future experiment. I will try to write later to see if that works out. But, if you don't mind protecting this unit...it can be used for this also. And, while the P-1800 has not arrived yet...it is likely that you could used this with an amplifier to at least bring the sound in to a range of normal (the jury is out). It is a big complaint for A/V type folks that using UPS kills the sound because of the need for this instantaneous current. I am proposing a possible solution I am exploring. Back to this unit and my home office. This exceeded my expectations. Runs like a champ. I do a lot of telework and I am never going to be off line. Even if this dropped off the laptops have batteries in them and I have a small Cyberpower 1500 PFLCD whose only purpose in life is to back up the router (5 Watts). So, when the UPS dies, which would take considerable time beyond a work day...everything is still humming. Power Grids are becoming increasingly unreliable. I made the decision to go ""big"" or ""bigger"" on an UPS based on a situation of being at home and working and simply not being able to afford to have down time during a work day. In addition I realized that in spite of the fact that the refrigerator will keep your food cold for hours, if you leave it closed...that is not much use to me if I am in the middle of an outage and need to eat to keep going. That is the motivation for getting the 2200 (with a 15 amp adapter cord...make sure you know the total max draw including charging if you pursue this) I mention above. I will be ordering that soon. I just ordered two more EBMs. The one I ordered with this did show up with a brown exotic spider living inside of it. It looked poisonous and was rather large. I am a wimp and I killed it. So, just be advised when you open these, that they are shipped from ""somewhere."" Don't ask me where ""somewhere"" is found? The Desert? No idea. The office set up is in a bed room and others have mentioned that the Blue LED engaged unit light is bright and always on. It is true. Unless you sleep with lights on, it is going to annoy you. Just do what someone on here did and put a piece of tape over it to dull it with a piece of paper over the light portion. Do NOT get to carried away. You may need to access the switch. The UPS CAN be turned off. This will cut the power to everything hooked up, but if it is the middle of the night, the whirring fans and the beeping could ruin your relationship or alienate your pets. ;) You doubtfully will be getting any sleep. This will turn off the Blue ""on"" LED light also. Now, if your power is intermittent all the time, you are going to need to think about the above and get realistic. The UPS can be placed in a closet and it has excellent vertical bracing support brackets. You can save money on the cost of a fancy rack and simply place it in a vertical position. These vertical brackets are like book ends that snap into place underneath. They are made of reasonably sturdy plastic. Also, each extra EBM will come with two plastic extenders that allow these ""footer-type-brackets"" to be expanded, so that you can sandwich them in tightly like book ends. They snap into place, lock and are secure UPS & EBM(s) in an upright position together. I suggest you consider a solution some A/V installers do, where they put this kind of unit concealed in an actual closet. You (like me) are going to have to consider how and where you will route cords without creating a dangerous Kludge. Not only to avoid electrocution, but imagine what the fire Marshall might say if you have wires strung around your house not to code and you have a fire. That could be a liability issue. Also, all modules have fans. The fans are located on each far sides of the EBMs. Thus, in the vertical position that would mean you can find them on the top and bottom. Every additional fan is going to add 3dB more noise (referenced to a single fan). So, yes. Every time you add an EBM the baseline of two fans is going to increase the noise by 3dB (referenced to each unit/EBM). Thus, you can add the dBs to the basic unit to plan ahead and calculate the loudness of the units. Or I can just tell you, it will sound like you are in a server room. Take your pick, some noise and reliable power or no noise and no power. The solution for the kitchen, if I do it...and I probably will...will wrap into a close on the floor at the base with the sound beep one lead pulled off after opening and safely terminated in insulation to prevent conduction to any surface inside the unit. If I ever were to sell the unit, I would reconnect the wire. We are talking about a single internal speaker wire removal here. If this plan does not work, I will then flow the equipment to an audio system or first try it on a freezer...another pending purchase. The freezer is less likely. You just leave them shut. Many of the people posting here are telling you about multiple systems around their house. Yes. The cost does add up. Since (again unless you have constant power problems) we are generally talking about occasional outages, this is where you assess your extension cord situation. In an ice storm for instance, a bright extension cord that is 50' or 100' and appropriately rated for the power it will carry to match or exceed your UPS can be a valuable cost saving measure to get power around the house on a temporary basis during a short storm. There are advantages to having the stand alone systems people are describing. No or few extension cords. Local power station type set up. This is all very valuable. One for your office and after tested and I can confirm it...probably within the next six months...something for some very basic, but moderately extended outages. Also, know that these modular battery back ups are a superior solution to big car batteries and inverters with dangerous wires strung about to cobble together a diy solution. I contemplated doing that instead, because you can pick everything you want: the inverter, the Batteries, etc... but in the end, this was the safest and most eloquent solution. It was not the least expensive. That said, these are VERY reasonably priced for what you get. OVERSIZE. If you are considering doing this. You need to oversize and read the run time charts based on your load. If you do not know the total Wattage you need. It is time to get out a piece of paper and a pen and start looking on the backs of your appliances and adding it up. Another and better way to do this is to use a Kill-O-Watt 4460 type meter...also something you can find here on amazon and to use the office example: buy a nice solid Tripplite PDU. I recommend the PDUMH15. These are here on Amazon and are like a safe extension cord with many outlets. If you have the money for a rack system, then you are going to be able to mount them in a Rack. Otherwise, plug the Kill-O-Watt meter into the wall. Then plug your chosen PDU into it. Then, plug your office LED lighting ;) into it and your laptop(s), your printers, everything and start to see how all of this adds up and what you can unplug. If you can afford it. i use two PDUs in the office. One prior to the UPS. This has the laser printer, photo-copier hogs connected to it and anything else that I could care a less about taking care of in a power outage. Then, take your other PDU and put this AFTER the UPS. Now, connect everything to this you wish to be UPS protected. Your critical stuff. If you do not have money for the PDUs, then work with the outlets on the back of the unit. There are two banks. One is for critical equipment and the other is for non-critical and at a set time....which (I believe ) is software configurable...those outlets will drop off to conserve runtime. In a true power emergency, I recommend you are more involved. You do NOT know when the power will be back, so only run your critical stuff and as needed turn the hogs on (the ones you have tested to assure that they will not cause your ups to shut off until you reboot it with these no longer connected. The software is a little kludegy. If your laptop goes to sleep the UPS loses the bead on the communication with your laptop(or stand alone computer) and when you wake the computer back up you will be greeted with a couple of messages telling you the obvious: the connection was lost (It is obviously down, your computer is sleeping, not processing). *****Update12/13/2013****Today, during another real outage...the messages will show up on the scree that the UPSs is on (rather obvious...it IS loud and beeping. Later when the UPS shuts off and power is restored, you will get another message to that effect. ************** The beep is annoying, but these are really serious Server UPS for a professional environment. That means in a true mission critical operation like a workplace your IT Network team is going to be manning the situation and want to know about what units have activated. The units monitor and report their internal operating temperature and run cool (in my application). The waste heat around 100 Watts is very minimal. Should YOU buy this? Well, These are a big step up. You are buying this because you ARE serious. You are not fooling around with Power Outages, whether you are a small company, a large organization or a modest person with a home office and realize that this is an investment in your valuable time. If you rely on energy/power like I do, then this comes highly recommended. It is the solution for its range. It is a value in that range. Yes. you can build whole generators. Your money is the limit. But, this IS the STEP you take if you are getting out of dinky UPS that damage your equipment and do not do much but give you enough time to shut down smoothly. Those are valuable and that is what I had until now. But IMHO, this is what you step up to as the next level. Let's say you live in a Condo and you have not back up generator for the building. Then, these are really good to keep you up an running if you work at home ever. Now, I can lose power all day and keep working. Frankly, that IS AMAZING. And this recent ice storm is what it took for me to KNOW it was NOW time to order TWO more EBMs. I buy and build as I go. Unless you are gushing with money or have a specific preplanned application thought through, just buy this unit, then order the EBMs. For some people, even the basic unit can be enough. The first EBM will really take you to a whole other level of back up. Also, strategize to maximize your run time during an outage to keep the load just to what you need. Also, as mentioned, these are not built to run ""reactive"" loads like motors. It is possible that inserting the P1800 in between might just allow you to do this...it will present a big power draw as more of a steady RMS draw looking back at the UPS. But, you will be using up your run time. These are NOT intended for Hospital or safety of life. Do NOT buy this to back up Medical equipment you may have at home or in a Doctor's office. I Highly recommend these units. You can also buy a small Honda or some other generator from Amazon, Home Depot, or your local Hardware store and set that outside and run a cord directly to supply power to your UPS during a snowstorm and at least have power if you care to...around the clock. The UPS takes on the duty when the generator is not running, and vice versa. I live in a small house and will possibly store a small amount of diesel in the laundry room in the proper containers for a small protable diesel generator in a more distant future to back up the UPS. Do not buy an UPS to run heaters. You need a different plan. Look into propane, Kerosine, and other solutions and make sure you always crack a window IAW directions. And, place these on a safe surface and install batter backed-up Carbon Monoxide detectors. If these alarm...that means you need to leave the house. So, keep the air moving. Be safe. Our power and weather are not what they use to be. Cheers! It is my hope that this information has been helpful to all of you in considering this leap. Good Luck.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S
Pro: Three year warranty. Con: Very heavy junk if there is any issue after that,2.0 ,"Unit has a great price to feature ratio, especially when comparing to APC or other higher-end business level similar equipment. Couple of things learned from the first and last Cyberpower product we installed: The warranty is three years. After that they offer no repair services, technical support noted they were not aware of any 3rd party repair centers either. Our unit started turning itself off (not the finest quality for a UPS), until it simply would not power on again. Cyberpower support indicated ""95%"" likely a bad battery. I didn't realize at the time before ordering a replacement that was the only service option available. Our problem must have been something in the other 5% of possibilities, total junk 6 months out of warranty. Oddly while this is intended to be used in a rack cabinet (a plus it included the necessary hardware and 4 point rails), the model number and serial number are on the side of the unit. So should you need to contact support, have the model and serial number written down before you install the unit, or you'll find yourself pulling a 70+ pound box out of the cabinet to read something that should have been on the front or rear of the unit. Nice looking, great features for price, but while the other APC UPS rack units we have cost signifantly more, they have all lasted twice to three times longer then the Cyberpower unit.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S
Item Failed In 4th Year Of Service,2.0 ,"This UPS had worked well for me since I purchased it around June, 2010. Several days ago, I powered it down overnight, and then tried to power it up the next morning. The unit wouldn't power on, simply beeping twice and then appearing to reset. It kept repeating this cycle every few seconds, even after trying the power button multiple times. I also tried pressing the reset button on the back, and I even unplugged the unit from the wall and let it sit for several hours. I then checked the voltage level of the batteries at the main connector, and it measured 52 volts, which is normal. The unit would not turn on to provide battery backup power, and would not even pass through power from the electrical outlet. It was/is completely dead! Since nothing I'd checked had helped, I called Cyber Power technical support, who told me to check the battery voltage. After I said that I'd already done this, the tech support agent simply said that since the unit was out of warranty it would be best to purchase a new unit. According to him, there is no repair available for such an expensive product. I'm amazed that a $700+ device is simply treated as a disposable item. I'll be going back to an APC product after this adventure, even though their products tend to cost a bit more than similar Cyber Power units. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Cyber Power products over the long term!","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S
Finally found a UPS that works,5.0 ,"We live in the Santa Cruz mountains and have bad power--sags, spikes, and outages. We have burned up at least ten UPSs (no exaggeration), from various manufacturers (APC, Belkin, TrippLite, etc.), ranging all the way up to 1100 watts, and costing up to $250 per device. Nothing worked. Then we saw very positive reviews for CyberPower, liked the specs (true sine-wave, very long backup times, etc.), and bought two of these units. What a difference! Installation involved plugging them in (no battery to connect--it arrived connected), configuration involved installing the software (which took about 60 seconds), and that was it. We've had lots of rain and wind already this winter, and these UPSs have kept our two big computers, two laptops, router, firewall, switch, wireless, and multiple 1600x1200 flat panels running perfectly. Most amazingly, we had an outage this morning for an hour, and when the power came back on our computers were still running--email was still up, nothing had shut down at all--because there was so much power in reserve. And because we have Amazon Prime, shipping for these heavy beasts was *free*. These may seem expensive, but not nearly as expensive as throwing away a couple thousand dollars worth of burned up UPSs that didn't work.","CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower",B0039YX76S

It all works very well and is very reliable,5.0 ,"I'm in the process of moving from 18 X-10 nodes to an Insteon system. All of the Insteon gear is absolutely reliable. It takes a little time to get used the process of creating and scheduling scenes--the instructions could be a little more user friendly--and there are some capabilities which may be missing, for example, a device switching off/on/off and dimming/brightening during one 24 hour period. Also, there cannot be more than one scene which uses ""sunset"" and/or ""sunrise"" for scheduling times. Note that I may be having these issues because I've spent over 15 years with X-10. As the hub is OTA upgradable and smartphone app is too, the chances are these features will be enhanced over time, So far these are nits for me and, overall, I am very optimistic about Insteon.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
"Expensive for what it is, but works well.",4.0 ,"It works for what I needed, which is to turn on my Amazon Basics Bluetooth Receiver when I tell Alexa to turn on Amazon Music through the Harmony Hub and then instruct her as to what to play. This way, her everyday voice is through her internal speaker and sound only goes the bluetooth route when the AV system is in 5 channel music mode and the bluetooth receiver is on. The plug responds quickly and seems to work just fine even though I have it plugged into surge protector/UPS.

Great product. But couldn't properly pair to 2 motion sensors as originally intended,4.0 ,"I love this product works exactly as described with no problems and easy setup. I initially bought it for my Christmas tree lights. I wanted to have it paired to two motion sensors, one at my front entrance and one at the back so that entering the house by either door would turn on the lights. While it was capable of pairing to both motion sensors, the switch wouldn't work consistently. Sometimes it worked fine and either motion sensor could trigger lights on, sometimes only 1 would work and sometimes none would work. But when paired to 1 motion sensor the system worked flawlessly. I am not sure whether it was this product or the insteon motion sensor causing the conflict. I also did have problems when trying to unpair one of my motion sensors to this module. The method to unpair as described in the manual didn't seem to work. The easiest solution for me was simply to factory reset the whole module. Overally great product, I have recommended to friends and family already.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

My first attempt at linking it with my door sensor was a spectacular failure. Not sure what I did wrong ( and I do think it's my fault) but the light would turn on despite not being triggered.

Works great- love Insteon (wallet wishes it was cheaper),5.0 ,"Over the past 6 months i've installed 2 of this particular lamplinc, 1 of the older non- dual band lamplinc, a new dual band outlet receptacle (not sure the proper name), a number of switches and two 8 button keypads. I've also got the HomeLinc software and a Smartlinc (used exclusively as a timer for exterior lights). The new dual band module is much smaller than the older version. That alone is worth the [small] price difference. The extra 1/3 thickness really makes a difference when trying to get the product behind a bookshelf. The appearance is clean and simple. Not sure if the dual band is really needed but it's nice not to have phase couplers (warts as i've heard them called) installed throughout the house.

Second, I have most of the first floor under Insteon control and I cannot imagine doing the programing with either the HomeLinc software or something similar. For the 8 button switches I have multiple scenes and would have pulled my hair out trying to program it all manually. Third, if you get 6 or 8 button switches spend the $20 and get custom buttons made. It will impress your friends and most importantly stop your wife from complaining ""the house is smarter than me."" Lastly, get the HomeLinc or similar software. Did I mention this before? Really, just do it... Imagine you have a program set up with 3 lamps and 2 circuits of overhead lights and your wife mentions ""I still think this is a little too bright for the mornings."" WIthout software this is a nightmare to fix. With the software you can make the adjustments in 3 minutes. It took my family a month or so to get the system dialed in exactly for our needs. The software made me utilize the system much more than I would of if everything was manual. Good luck and happy automation.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
Quality Product,4.0 ,"We ordered three of these to control various lights around our house, as well as to turn our entertainment power on/off to save power.

I like this too!,5.0 ,"This is one of the best gizmos I've ever bought - easy to set up; works all the time so I never have to think about it. Has persistent storage so it's brains are not lost if power goes out, and gets time from the Internet so DST is not a problem. CONS - documentation is practically non-existent, and I'd like a few extra features in setting ON/OFF times like a randomize. And a bit pricey but not exorbitant.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
Just what I needed,5.0 ,"I bought this due to a problem with the Insteon toggle switch. The toggle switch I bought wasn't dual band but only works over the home wiring. The problem was that with the toggle being on a GFCI circuit, it couldn't communicate with the Insreon hub. I put this Lamplinc on a plug on the same GFCI and it was able to hook itself up to the hub as well as establish communication with the toggle.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

the better it will work,5.0 ,"IMHO, this is more versatile than the regular Insteon outlet module. Weatherproof, doesn't cover the other outlet, and dual band. The more of these dual band modules in your network, the better it will work. I use these to switch landscape lighting and other outdoor lights. But I also use them indoors. Works in a backyard outlet 150' away fed with buried cable. Not sure it's switching from the power line signal or the RF signal. Not sure I care since it works every time.

Great replacement for the X10 equipment,5.0 ,"I have been having great luck with the Insteon stuff. I have been transitioning from X10 with a lot of success. So far I have put in 5 wall dimmer, 3 plug in dimmers, 1 on/off plug in module, and one 1 on/off wall switch wired to a relay for a 220 application and all are working perfect. I bought the 2242 hub which can only be used with a smart device app. The sunset / sunrise option is a actually linked to the timeline you use which means it is dark when the lights come on if you use that option. I used a different time zone to get light to come on a little earlier with the scenes. I just have to remember the difference when programming lights by time. The scenes (through the app) are not that difficult to set up once you get the hang of it. It does not give you the security option of varying the on time, so I am going to go with the USB hub and see if that works better. The not so good: With LED's being controlled through the wall switches, they tend to flicker slightly when on really low intensity and the hub is querying the lights when the app tries to connect. This happens during slow connections. Now the real bad: if you lose internet connection, you completely lose access to the 2242 hub, even under local wi-fi. This is such a basic level flaw, that I consider a fatal flaw, hence the reason for going to a USB hub. So , for the Insteon switches and response, 5 stars because it all works and communicates great. If I were rating the entire system with the current hub, 3 stars.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

Although, at first I had a big crystal chandelier with halogen lightbulbs plugged into it, and the thing would get pretty hot; but that was only because I had a lot of power running to it.

An awesome product - ideal for vintage Christmas lights,5.0 ,"I love this little device. I had been looking for over a year for something that would work well for a vintage Christmas tree stand with built-in C6 bulbs that ran way too hot. This was the perfect option. Not only does remember your dimness setting even if you power the outlet off, but it also gives you the option of slowly increasing the current to your final brightness or going straight to that level with no cycling through full brightness. I also want to compliment the SmartHome tech support staff. When I first tried the dimmer, I thought it didn't work because if you tap the up or down buttons it acts as a simple on-off switch. You have to continuously hold the down button to dim it until you reach the desired level. So, I called them up. Within a couple minutes I was speaking to a native English speaker who quickly and courteously helped me out. So, not only is it a good product, but also has a good support staff to back it up. I would definitely buy this again. Highly recommended for any dimmable lights, but particularly delicate vintage sets.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

"Great features and form factor, disrupts older units",2.0 ,I bought two of these units hoping to use them as signal bridges and improve my network coverage. I had a couple of 'dead spots' where a SwitchLinc would get flakey reception (in a 75 unit installation). After I added two of these units to the configuration (replacing LampLinc's) everything got *very* flakey. Watching with a scope there is negligible noise on the line (a little switching noise from various dimmers) yet group commands are now about as reliable as X10 (even with the 'group cleanup' stuff). My installation is almost all older original gen units from 2004 and I suspect that firmware bugs in them are not playing well with the newer units. As a counter example I have a friend with about 70 units that are all new and include some of these newer lamplincs and he has no issues with them as signal bridges. For now I'm just living with the flakiness and have programmed my ISY-99 to repeat group commands several times to insure they occur (just like in the X10 days).

The mini remote works just fine -The programming is easy once you get the hang of it. Just takes a little while to learn -The products all work together really nicely My only complaints are: -Support line takes forever to get through to. > 30 min on hold is too long!

Check the Female Ground Socket for Fit,4.0 ,"I ordered this device to replace an Insteon light bulb which came out of the box defective. Problem with those bulbs is that you have no way of testing or troubleshooting connectivity, They don't have a status indicator LED to tell you if they are linking. The on/off module has a green indicator light. I plugged this in, used the Find New Device feature on my ISY dashboard and wallah! Instant connectivity. It costs a little more than the bulb but totally worth the price given that it's more flexible and can be used with motors up to 100hp and/or total loads of 1800 Watts. You can use it with a small heater. Two criticisms: The plastic casing could be a little heavier duty for what you pay, and also, my device seems to have a defective ground socket. I tried to plug in a grounded three-pronged plug and I could not get it to go in. I didn't want to force it because pressing hard on the module actually deformed the casing. Next one of these I buy, if the ground plug socket is a problem, I'll send it back. Bottom line, if you buy one of these, first thing to do is make sure you can plug in a three pronged plug.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

Does not work with Windows Mobile 10 - Lumia 950XL,1.0 ,"I have been investing in Insteon devices since they are compatible with Windows Phones, but recently the support for the Windows Phone platform by SmartHome has been severely neglected. In fact, the Insteon app does not work with Windows Mobile 10 (specifically my Lumia 950XL), so I cannot control any of my lights using this device with my phone.

Buyer beware of warranty issues!,5.0 ,"This is a great product, and easy to use. However, this item typically comes with a 2-year manufacturer's warranty (Smarthome.com) and they are usually very good about replacing failed items. So when my 8-month old device (sold by Amazon and not Smarthome through Amazon) failed I called Smarthome. They would not honor the warranty because they did not sell it to me directly. I was directed back to Amazon and of course the standard return policy wouldn't cover the item after 8 months. Fortunately for me Amazon Customer Service stepped up and helped me out. Lesson learned - buy from the manufacturer's website, or through their Amazon Storefront if you want to make sure you get full benefit of the manufacturer's warranty policy if they don't have a way to register purchases made elsewhere.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

Adequate. Be prepared to return one.,3.0 ,"The device, when it works, works as described. Programming is improved over the previous generation. After the initial pairing with a controller like the Insteon Hub, its scene memberships can be adjusted without having to press the Set button, which cuts legwork. Performance is fine. It mostly works with dimmable LEDs, with the normal LED gap between ""off"" and about 10%. Doesn't seem to make any singing noises when dimming. Receives commands more often than not. ""Dual-band"" is a real improvement over wireline-only. The onboard buttons are a courteous design gesture. The unit is smaller than the previous generation, but it lacks the pass-through plug, which means you'll be shopping for outlet strips with orthogonal plugs. The packing material is minimal and convenient, except the the unit itself is wrapped in clear tape to protect its finish. Removing the tape is the clumsiest and slowest part of unpacking and installing the device. In short, a user who is already invested somewhat in Insteon will find this unit to be more of the same. Someone who doesn't already have other Insteon devices should be sure to consider alternatives. While Insteon works well enough and is easy enough to use and to maintain, the devices are prone to failure. It's a strong effort from the designers and engineers, but the factory seems to let units out the door that barely pass testing. Compounding the frustration of losing a failed device is the requirement that you factory-reset all the controllers that were paired to it. There is no other way to unlink a device if it isn't working. The control network is also somewhat fiddly; the design is reasonable, and it's impressive that it works at all, but in practice, in a typical house, signals are often lost. So these things are fine. For a few rooms, they make for a nice-to-have. Just be prepared to send one or two back eventually.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

Very neat but pricey,4.0 ,"I have a switch in the master bedroom that only controls a useless outlet but I wanted to control the nightstand lights, so I bought one of these and a ToggleLinc dimmer. I wired the useless outlet live all the time, and replaced the switch with the ToggleLinc. I plugged the lamps into this LampLinc and it works great! Added benefits, the ToggleLinc has an LED that leads me to the switch in the dark. The LampLinc has up/down buttons so I don't have to get out of bed to turn the light off or on (or dim). I can't reach the outlet from the bed so I plugged this and the lamp in an extension cord and placed it near the bed. There is a red/green led in the LampLinc to stear me to the switch in the dark. The lamp can be dimmed for romantic atmosphere. And when you turn it on or off it ramps up/down so it doesn't shock the system with a rapid light change. It's quiet, no loud click like my old X10 control. A little pricey but I've been using Insteon for years without any issues. Well the wall switch/dimmer died last year - it was 3 years old, and the lamp module just died - it was also 3 years old. I opened each and found burnt components. Figures. They have a 2 year warranty. So between the 2 units, its costing me about $30 a year to control my bedroom light.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
Great for outdoor device control -- just not for the long term...,4.0 ,"These are great for controlling outdoor plug-in items. Two nits: (1) These have a tendency to fail after three or four years and you *will* be replacing them, so be prepared to do so in the future. I have about 4 of these outside that I bought when I built this house four years ago. Two have failed after about three years and have been replaced. Since they're outside and subject to weather, I guess that's not bad, but I do think they should last longer. (2) The most recent one had its address sticker (the one that has the Insteon xx.xx.xx address on it) on the top of the device, so it's very likely to get bleached by the sun or washed away by the rain. It would likely be better on the bottom where you plug in your device that is to be controlled, since that part faces the ground and is protected from weather and the sun.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
"Updated version, no longer X10 compatible",2.0 ,"I have a few of these around the house and I bought this to replace an older unit that quit working. Unfortunately this module is a newer version that no longer supports X10 signals. I have already quit using insteon controllers because they are so flaky. It seems home automation is still just a few years away form being ready for prime time. Maybe a few years further than it was a few years ago. The MOST important thing for home automation is that it is compatible with multiple systems and protocols. Releasing an updated device with less compatibility is just dumb. It might do what it was intended to do, but won't do anything for me.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
HomeKit support very disappointing,2.0 ,"I have to say that Insteon has been really behind and disappointing when it comes to HomeKit Support, which is really the only reason I bought it. It took them a year to update their app from iOS 9 to iOS 10. In the built in HOME app on the iPhone, their products all say ""No Response"" until you hit the button several times. I have emailed their support and they say they are working on it, but it takes many months for them to update anything. Unfortunately I had purchased a lot of their products and I just feel like they are not up to the task of dealing with Apple HomeKit updates in a timely manor. I have other products that use HomeKit, like Philips Hue, and their updates work within the first week or so of an update. Pretty disappointed.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
"Good product design, lousy post-purchase support.",1.0 ,"The design of the Insteon system with this On-Off Outdoor plug-in module is very good, and when it works, it works really well. I employ two of these modules, one to control a garden fountain, and the other to control the fountain lights. After connecting them to an Inston hub via WiFi, turning either one on or off is simply a matter of opening the Insteon app on my iPhone and pressing an on-off button. So what's the problem here? Well, both On-Off modules have failed less than two years after purchase. There is a two-year warranty, but the manufacturer has denied warranty coverage on the grounds that the devices failed due to power fluctuations. These Insteon people are really something! They evidently have the gift of sight, to be able to come to that conclusion without even examining the devices. Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa I am disappointed with their post-purchase behavior, as I had expected that they would stand behind their product, rather than invent reasons not to without any examination of the failed product.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
LED bulbs glow when device turned off.,2.0 ,"These devices provide a very small amount of power when turned off. Reading through various web searches, I thought it had something to do with the built in load sensing. However, there is a way to turn load sensing off, which I did. However, the devices still provide a very small amount of power in an off state. As a result my LED bulbs glow. In the past when I was using incandescent light bulbs this was never a problem, but LED bulbs have been around long enough to where there really is no excuse for these devices to peform so poorly. Until Insteon decides to listen to its customer and make a dimmable LampLinc product that turns the load completely off, I'm done spending any more money on this technology.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

I hate to see the direction and quality that insteon has taken over the past 3 years. They dropped support for the houselinc PC product that made assembly of a whole house system quick AND easy. Their product quality is not where it was 5 years ago. I have had to replace ten units in the past three years. The product I am reviewing, the On/Off Module, failed after 6 months.

Terrible support! Poor product life. Complex installation.,2.0 ,"Terrible customer service. He was trying to explain how a regular switch on a different circuit that has nothing to do with my 2 lamp modules or my Insteon hub can become linked to the Insteon system. These randomly turn on at any time. I have only 2 lamp modules nothing else on the hub. I was trying to understand what he was talking about. Then he hung up and the place is now closed. So, I will be returning my 2 Insteon modules and my Hub that I received today and I will cancel the order for my Echo. After deleting all my scenes and my devices and deleting my account and doing factory resets on the 2 Lamp Modules and My Hub many times, nothing has changed. I have followed the procedures exactly for doing factory resets. I followed all the steps on both lamp modules. I have simply plugged them in to the lamp and manually turned them off with the dimmer. After a few minutes the light turns on. No account has been created the hub is not plugged in and the other lamp module is not plugged in. Still the light turns on by itself. This happens with both lamp modules. Maybe both are defective. This is a simple lamp with a Cree Dimmable bulb. It has been used for years with a corded dimmer from Leviton with no problems at all. It is my fault now for continuing to spend time and energy. It looks like I have solved the problem. This answer to my problem is not documented anywhere. I searched and searched. The Answer is that load sensing is the default and it does not work. It was the cause of the random turn on problem. Again, the problem occurred with both modules. Call support if you want to learn how it is supposed to work, if you are having problems; tech support is a waste of time. But most of all if your lamp modules are turning on randomly, disable load sensing. The instructions for doing this are in the provided instructions. These dimmers, with load sensing disabled, actually work better than the Leviton ones they are replacing, I can set the LED bulbs to 10 percent with no flicker. EDIT: Many many months later, still this product has functioned perfectly. The Hub and my Echo Dot are not as reliable, but seem to get better as the updates come. I am so happy to have my Insteon system and my 3 Echo Dots. 2nd Edit: Complete Failure, I'm Switching to the Z-Wave standard.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
Convenient ... but quality control could be better (along with no-questions-asked return policy for manufacturing defects)!,3.0 ,"I don't know if this is a problem for all Insteon 2457D2 LampLinc INSTEON Plug-In Lamp Dimmer Module Dual-Band, 2-Pin devices, but my personal use was for a remote switch for an LED light string installed well out of routine reach to the electrical outlet powering the device and attached lighting. I happened to notice on a particularly dark night that -- even though the lights were switched ""OFF"" -- the 2457D2 was obviously delivering low voltage current to the LED lights. My advice, since according to seller, ""it was too late to return the device,"" is to plug the device into an outlet immediately upon receipt and use a tester to detect any electricity ""leaking"" through the device when turn in the off position. If you get any voltage at any amperage above that of ambient or free-space readings, return the device. On a final note, programming instructions for this device are not entirely clear and they are presented in such small print that you may find reading the instructions and implementing them to be a challenge. You'll eventually figure it out, but you shouldn't have to do so.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
the small power leakage builds up over time and every few seconds the LED will flicker (powering quickly on and off like a flash,1.0 ,"These devices will not work with LED bulbs, LED string lights or any low wattage consumption LEDs in general. What ends up happening is that, even when commanded to switch off, there is still some power leakage through this device to anything plugged in. In this case, when a low wattage consumption LED is plugged in, the small power leakage builds up over time and every few seconds the LED will flicker (powering quickly on and off like a flash), and continue going through this cycle indefinitely. There is a serious hardware engineering design flaw with these devices in general, throughout the entire Insteon product line that involve On/Off and dimmer modules, regardless whether they are micro modules, full-size, outdoor, etc. I would stay away from Insteon in general if you plan to use them with low-wattage LED bulds (under 50W load).","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

Even when the unit is turned ""off,"" somehow some power continues to flow to the load because the LEDs glow faintly. The whole idea of this unit was to free me from having to climb a ladder to manually plug the lights into the outlet. Unless I'm willing to burn a small amount of electricity constantly consumed by power leaking to the load, this flaw has defeated its purpose. I will be contacting Amazon and the vendor for a replacement and perhaps my outcome will be better. If you order this unit, it would be worth your time to test it in a very dark room with an LED nightlight or an meter to check it because they are obviously not testing it sufficiently at the factory.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK

Solved a very important problem,1.0 ,"During a remodel the electricians could not run a single dimmer switch to control cabinet lighting for cabinets on either side of the fireplace. There was wiring for outlets on each side of the fireplace so there was power. Their solution was to use a dimmer switch for each set of cabinets. This would mean that I would have to walk from one side of the room to control one cabinet, walk to the other side of the room to control the other cabinet, and walk to another location in the room to control the overhead lighting. I purchased the IInsteon 2477D SwitchLinc INSTEON Remote Control Dual-Band Dimmer along with two Insteon 2457D2 LampLinc INSTEON Plug-In Lamp Dimmer Modules and put the switch in the existing switch box, connected the LampLinc modules to the cabinet lights, and programmed everything to work as if the lights were being controlled from a wired dimmer switch. Installation was easy and setting up the lighting that was being controlled was easy as well.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
Directional Plug is a pain,2.0 ,"The unit is a minor improvement from the appliance modules; it can handle small loads, although the construction is much more flimsy than the appliance module. My biggest complaint is that the ground pin goes the opposite direction of the wall wart I need to control. It's a 50-50 shot and all, but they picked wrong for the one device I was wanting to use it on. Non-polarized plugs are much easier to deal with. In a perfect world, the unit would have a swivel on both the wall plug and the unit's controlled socket, but it isn't worth any extra money to be sure. For people trying to decide on which type of control system to go for, there are a lot of limitations with Insteon. Each system has its own pros and cons, and as of January 2014 things sure don't seem to be well resolved. The costs really go up as you add a controller, modem, and the control devices.","Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00B1GHKUK
Wemo Outlet - A Good Thing,5.0 ,"Ordered the Wemo smart plug on 16 APR 16- (prime shipping, 32.99 + 2.23 tax), installed it in minutes when it arrived. It's been in use for over 5 months at the time of this review (19SEP16). ------------------------------------------------------- OVERVIEW: I use this (and several other Wemo devices) with my Echo (aka Alexa!)- which means I only use this device ""locally"". (I don't have any application where I count on this device to respond to me when I'm abroad.) This Wemo outlet works flawlessly when house-power is stable (See •• below). I have other Wemo devices that I have programmed on/off times of day... my personal application of this switch does not require any daily routines to be programmed. My only interaction with this device is voice commands (e.g. ""Alexa, turn TV off""). >>The outlet controls the power to the TV. There are times when the TV has been left on and the remote is not within eyesight. Walking through the room I can simply command Alexa to turn off the TV - and walah! for a one-time expense of 40 bucks I have solved the family conflict of ""where's the *+=#$*@ remote. (and the buttons on the new TVs are too stealthy for me). The PRO's: Part of the Wemo family- Wemo's simple *but stable* cloud programming allows me to set up times of day to turn my device on or off. Times of day can be absolute (e.g. ""11:00 PM- TURN OFF"") or can be relative (e.g. ""Turn off 30 min after sunset""). Really... if you aren't familiar with Wemo power in your home- read up or just buy a single device to test it out. Simple home automation done affordably well.) The CON's: • Large protrusion from the outlet, bulky on the wall. (As you can see- I gave it 5 stars because I don't care about the bulky protrusion- but this ""feature"" still exists). •• Doesn't always recover from a power outage. A power outage can be hard on devices, since it's often not a clean drop in line voltage... but more of a ""brown out"" situation (low voltage still present/not cool for electronic components)- or worse-a surge in power before a brown out. This condition also impacts my wireless router (randomly)- so the inability for the switch to come back online following a power outage is also affected by my router's ability to come back online. In the 5 months I've had this switch I've had to walk over an manually press the reset button on the rear of the device. No biggee- unless I used this device in a remote-control scenario). Again- this feature hasn't diminished my 5 star rating. Net Evaluation= none of the cons take away from why I purchased this device. It's stable, provides lots of flexibility and IS a recommended buy. Would I buy another one? The $40 price tag drives a fair amount of ""need"" on my part before I'll part with the cash. I've tried other competitors with a slightly lower price, however the cloud support & set up doesn't hold a candle to Wemo. DISCLOSURE: Wemo (nor anyone else) gave me a single nickel to write this review. It's absolutely unbiased- I'm motivated only by the desire to share a good thing with others when I come across it. Happy Automating.....","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

not reliable,2.0 ,"✳ i did not receive any discount nor did i get this product for free, i paid full price. My husband has been into making our home automated. From cat wiring to lights turning on with voice. He's an IT Major and he sure is putting it to good use (laugh out loud) He wanted this wifi light control so that we could turn off lights with our voice or from our phone if gone. So he got this one. Well, he was so wanting it to work, but it failed. He says it's not very reliable. Works sometimes. He hooked it up through our amazon echo and it barely worked. It would work great for a few testings, then it would say ""sorry, I do no understand that command."" But yet it would turn the light on/off. So if you have a huge house, you would think that it's not working and have to walk to check it and find that it was working. After the firmware update this started happening. Before the firmware update, the echo worked fine with it. App does not work well, not easy to set up. Took him 30 minutes to set up, when it should have taken way less than that. The whole set up was just a nightmare So, I can not give this product more than a two star and the two star is only because it worked half the time, or it would have gotten a one star. Hoping this issue can get fixed. So needless to say, this product is not reliable at all.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Is this product ready for the market??,1.0 ,"I bought this a few months ago and only today decided to try it out. I relied on the past reputation of Belkin....had a read some of the reviews I probably would not have purchased. I want it to work with the Echo Dot 2. I finally was able to set it up and get it to work.....after considerable time and effort (at least an hour). I only have an engineering background. The instructions are completely useless. It appears from other reviewers that their customer support capabilities are among the worse. Since many if not most customer support staffs are relatively bad, this is saying a lot. Obviously Belkin no longer cares what their name is attached to. It is clear that this product is not ready to be sold and used by the mass market, but perhaps only more suitable for techie types in the wireless data fields. Overall, it is really quite a shame that the management of this company would want to stand behind this type product. This is the type of products we use to laugh about (50+ years ago) when some foreign countries were just starting to produce and sell goods on the world market. If Belkin management (CEOs etc.) are willing to stand behind these products, then that says it all. The question remains though, should Amazon?","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Runs my 1500W oil heater with SmartThings,5.0 ,"I bought this Belkin WeMo plug to use with my SmartThings (v2) hub. I a man extremely happy. The integration was flawless and it works like a dream. I first downloaded and installed the WeMo app to get the plug set up with my home wifi network. It was just a couple steps for SmartThings to add the plug to its system, and voila. It is easy to add whatever automated process you want to it. And for those not running the SmartThings environment, you can run automated processes from the WeMo app too. I currently run the plug on an electric oil heater. The heater is a max of 1500 watts, and the plug is rated at 1800 watts. It was no problem running it. I certainly plan on buying more!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Simple device if you only want to automate a few things.,3.0 ,"I've been doing home automation since the X10 days. My current system is mostly Insteon and is controlled by an Indigo server. This setup is rock-solid reliable. If you have a Wi-Fi network and don't want to invest in any home automation hubs or controllers, this device and it's siblings will probably work for you. It's pretty simple to set up and control from your handheld device. The device seems to be well made. The downside is there are only a few modules out for WeMo right now. I don't see any dimmer modules. All of the lighting requires investing in a hub. The upside is Belkin and some other companies are actively promoting it. So it doesn't look like it will die off soon.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I love it.....but!,4.0 ,"I've had my Echo since December (2015), I like it but it was pretty limited as to what it could do. ""Time"", Weather"", ""What's the meaning of life""!, etc I liked the idea of adding voice control to the house. I started with the Hue and liked it, but it's crazy expensive!!! So I thought I would give the WEMO a try, it works great, great price point, I love it..... but!!! The problem is the set up. With the experience of setting up my Gopro and Hue, this setup process needs work (hint, hint software engineers at Belkin). I followed the setup procedure to the letter, and it wouldn't accept my wifi password. I finally got it to work after shutting everything down several times, and then 'poof', it started working. Now that it works.... it works great. I have the light by the bed plugged into it. If I'm reading in bed and I want to sleep, ""Alexa, Lights off"", she turns off the lights and says ""OK"".

My favorite home automation brand,5.0 ,"I have these all over my house, LOVE THEM! I especially love not having to purchase a hub or any other device to make this work. Made it feel like a more affordable choice for me. To control kids room energy consumption: Every morning, my kids would leave the lights or AC on in their rooms when leaving for school. With Wemo products, I have their lights and AC on schedule to turn off when we leave the house everyday, they don't leave things on. To power on\off lights outside my house: On schedule to run on at dusk and turn off. Love controlling the lights in my backyard with this To power on rooms when I arrive at home: I have some lights setup inside my home (Foyer, living room, kitchen) when I arrive at home, so that if I am carrying packages, I don't have to stumble on my way in getting things powered on.

Works great with Echo,4.0 ,"It arrived today, and in a few minutes I had it set up so that all I say is ""Alexa light on"" and in a half second, the light is on. Alexa then says ""ok."" Same for light off. During setup, you can change the default name of the device (the default was ""Wemo switch,"" which I changed to ""light""), so if I automate more lights, I will have to add an extra word, like bedroom light, or kitchen light. I deducted one star, because the setup using the Wemo app is a bit obscure. You download it, open it up, and it tells you to go to settings, which you cannot get to in the app. Ok, so after a minute or so of ""huh?"" I realized that they wanted me to go to my tablet settings, not Wemo settings. They could have made that clear. It also temporarily fiddles with the wifi while setting up, and in my case froze when it was finished. Just reboot the app and your wifi connection. After the Wemo is set up, just tell your Echo, ""Alexa, discover devices."" Alexa will say the devices she finds, and your switch should be working on Alexa voice command.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Super easy setup,5.0 ,I was skeptical about this. I wanted something to be able to easily turn on and off my scented wax warmer which is plugged in and placed on a shelf that is up high. It arrived last night and I got it all plugged in and set up (myself! Im not tech savvy so you know it was super easy if I did it myself) and within 15 minutes I was able to control it from my phone. The ONLY complaint I had is that I purchased this to work with our Echo and this WeMo advertised itself as Echo compliant but had no instructions on *HOW* to connect it to our Echo. Even with that information void I was able to look it up online and get it synced. It all works as it should. We will be buying more in the future to automate more of our lamps and such.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love WeMo Switch for enabling remote control of my entire home.,5.0 ,"Love my WeMo Switch. My entire home has every lamp plugged in with a WeMo switch -- many of the switches I have a power strip plugged in so that multiple lights are all plugged into one switch, and thus I have more than double the number of lights as switches. The reason wasn't so much for cost savings as sheer space - having 3-4 lights in close proximity and using one WeMo switch each becomes quite bulky and space is at a premium. I am eagerly awaiting the dimmer wall switch so that I can complete my full home automation and eliminate the last thing that I have to physically go and turn off/on (which is the ceiling light controlled by wall switch). I was not willing to sacrifice the dimming option on my ceiling light which is why I have not used the already available WeMo wall switch for it - in a few months the new WeMo dimmer will be out. I have all my WeMo connected lights connected to my Google Home, as well as IFTTT - so I've had a lot of fun experimenting with setting rules that pick up my location and when I arrive home, IFTTT has turned on all the lights in my home for me. At other times, I can say ""Hey Google"" and then ""Turn off everything"" and 17 lights instantly go off.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
A Great Smart Outlet That Automates Any Device in Your Home,4.0 ,"The WeMo Switch is a wifi enabled smart plug which allows you to turn electronic devices on and off and create schedules using your smartphone or tablet. The WeMo Switch is compatible with Android and iOS devices and it allows you to control your home devices from anywhere you have a wifi, 3G or 4G connection. The WeMo Switch works with Amazon Echo / Alexa which gives you voice command over your devices. It works with Nest to sync up with your thermostats home and away modes to automatically turn your devices off and on based on your location. The WeMo Switch is also IFTTT compatible. You need to install the WeMo app from the Google Play store or the Apple App store to control the WeMo Switch. There are two ways to operate your devices using the WeMo Switch. First off there is a power button on the front that you can manually turn on and off if you don't have your smartphone or tablet handy. When you open the WeMo app it looks for switches. Once your device is found you press the power button to turn the device on and off. Besides turning devices on and the WeMo app can also set schedules or Rules to tell devices when to turn on or off. I recommend this device to anyone looking to power devices on and off whether at home or away.

Don't waste your money!,2.0 ,"Bought my second switch in July after the first quit working. Now the second switch quit. Again I have searched the web for fixes and tried all of the methods to get it to work with no success. The first switch worked perfectly until it quit. The second switch would let me turn it on at sunset but wouldn't actually turn off at the selected time. It would only turn off at sunrise. While not ideal it was acceptable. Today it failed. It started by not being detected. Reset did not work. Uninstalling the app and reinstalling did not work. I'm done. I will either find a wireless alternative or I will go low tech and install a light sensor or a plain on off switch. I would not recommend this product to a friend. Hell, I won't even recommend to an enemy.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I bought 2. Neither works anymore. Get another product.,1.0 ,"First of all, connecting them can be a pain. For example, there's a point in the setup process where the app says something like ""please wait; connecting to WeMo..."" for about 30 seconds, and then it will fail. Try it a second time, and it will work immediately. Go figure. And that's just one example. There are 3 separate issues I've had with my WeMos. Each WeMo has had all 3 of these issues at some point. The first issue is that the app is no longer able to communicate with the WeMo reliably. Sometimes this means that you try to turn off a WeMo remotely, and the app hangs indefinitely without turning off the light. Then, if you force close the app and open it back up, it might happen to work that time. But maybe not. Half the time, you'll end up having to walk over to the WeMo and turn it on or off manually. However, the rules might still work when this happens, meaning the WeMo works okay in an automatic sense, but is not in your manual control. The second issue is that the WeMo disconnects from the wifi spontaneously. This can happen a day after setup, or 3 weeks after setup. But it always disconnects. You'd think it would just reconnect when the signal strength was appropriate. After all, each WeMo switch does save a copy of the wifi credentials. But nope, once it disconnects, it just gives up. The only way to reconnect it is to do a factory reset and perform the entire setup all over again, including connecting it to wifi and setting up the rules. One thing to note is that the rules sometimes still work, as in the example above. But half the time, it will also inexplicably forget the rules you've programmed into it. The third issue is that it forgets the rules spontaneously. Usually this happens within 24 hours of the factory reset you just performed because your WeMo disconnected itself from the wifi and was too lazy to reconnect. When it forgets the rules, naturally you'll try to set up the rules again. The app will claim that the rules have been saved into the device, but the device won't execute them, and when you open the app again, you'll find that there are no rules listed. This has been the most frustrating and disappointing product I can remember buying, with the exception of my LG Nexus 5X. (That tells you how bad LG sucks.)","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works Great!! (now that I have reserved an IP in my router) ...,5.0 ,"I now own 12 of these WeMo switches and they have been working perfectly for the last 6 months, but that wasn't always the case. I got my first WeMo switch before Christmas 3 years ago to control my Christmas lights. Every month or so they would drop off my home network and the WeMo app showed them as ""Not Detected"". They just quit working. I would have to unplug and plug them back in to get them working again. It was frustrating, but I thought it was a small price to pay for the convenience. I purchased more WeMo switches to control table lamps and my porch Light but the more I had, it seemed the problems go worse. I was resetting these things weekly and sometimes more than once in a day. I wanted to throw them out and customer service didn't have clue. This may be a bit too techy for some people, but this is what I did. One day I had an idea. I know that when a network device has a DHCP assigned IP address, the IP is ""leased"" and will change once the lease expires (typically 24 hours). I thought ""what if I set a static or reserve an IP address in my router that never changes? Voilà, that did the trick!! I haven't had a single problem since, and that was about 6 months ago that I made to change. I would recommend to anyone having problems with these switches, as I was, to try setting a static IP address before giving up. It's not too difficult, and for me it was well worth the 20 minutes that it took.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great for Turning On a Lamp or Two. (Or for your spaceship bridge),4.0 ,"If you plan to use this switch to perform 'smart home' functions connected through IFTTT / Google Home, it'll do the trick. Every once in a while, there is a one or two second delay before it switches on/off. I'd say it fails to even trigger once ever 50 uses or so, but this is all subject to your wifi settings and conditions. If you happen to play Artemis Space Ship Bridge Simulator, you can tie this into your simulation using a free program called Bridge Tools! Great for a red-alert light. When compared to Philips Hue, the WeMo switch falls short. This is understandable since Hue has its own hub for dedicated signaling. If you only want to turn on/off a few lights, the WeMo is a cheap option, but if you need to do more than a couple, you should look at other solutions. That said, the cool thing about the WeMo is that it will power anything you plug into it, not just lamps.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love this setup,5.0 ,"This is a review for the regular WeMo Smart Switch not the Insight Switch. I have four of them, controlling two table lamps in my living room and two in my bedroom. They are large but not too big. The official wemo app is slow but other than that the setup is straightforward. Make certain that your wifi router is transmitting at 2.4ghz and not 5ghz. Also make certain that wifi security is set to wpa2 only and not wpa or wpa/wpa2 (I suspect people having issues with the setup have incompatible router settings). I am using these switches with my Google Home and IFTTT for voice control. I also use the timer function built into the app which turns one living room lamp on automatically in the evening before I get home so that I walk into a well lit house. The app's timer then automatically turns off all lamps at bedtime. I considered going with Phillips Hue bulbs or SmartThings but the total cost for the same automation would have been much, much higher plus those products require a hub. I love my setup and the lower cost!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Switch appeared previously used and would not connect to wireless network,3.0 ,"I had high hopes for this product, as my WeMo light switches work perfectly and are very convenient, but there were a couple problems that ultimately made me return this switch. First, although the shipping box was undamaged and the product box appeared unopened, the switch was visibly scuffed as if previously opened and used (see attached photo). I decided to overlook that and use it anyway, at which point I found the switch simply would not connect to my home's wireless network. Again, my WeMo light switch experience was flawless, so I expected this to work equally well. After following WeMo's troubleshooting instructions, multiple resets of the switch, and digging around for anything else that could help, I gave up and returned it. Amazon is exchanging it, and I really hope the replacement works properly. Nevertheless, first impressions last, and I can't recommend this based on the experience I had with it. Update: The replacement unit arrived, and strangely, it also had slight scuffing near the prongs. After 3 factory resets and reinstalling the WeMo app, it was finally able to connect to my wireless network. Compared to the WeMo Light Switch setup experience, the WeMo Switch's was just awful. Bumping the rating up to 3 stars because it does (finally) work and is really convenient, but the setup process needs vast improvements.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
My first Echo peripheral,4.0 ,"I bought this switch to test out my Amazon Echo's home control functions. I use it on the lamp on my bedside table. The Echo seems to take longer (a few seconds, but all other commands are recognized immediately) to understand command to the switch, but otherwise, they work together well. I'd like to replace my wall switches with WeMos to give my Echo control of all my lights and ceiling fans, but I'm waiting for Belkin to add dimming capability to them - something that, in my opinion, they sould have had from day one.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works great as a sleep timer and easily connected to Echo,4.0 ,"My wife likes to watch TV in bed before she goes to sleep. Of course she always falls asleep with the TV on. The TV has a sleep timer but it's buried in a menu tree and there's no way you're going to navigate it every night to set the timer. I have a Harmony remote but it's of no use either. I got this switch because it seemed like it was going to fit my needs and it sort of has. It connected to my home's WiFi easily and I downloaded the WeMo app to my Android phone. No problem turning the switch on and off (I tested in the same room as the router with a lamp plugged in rather than the television). This is where my ""sort of"" comment from above comes in but it's OK. What I was hoping for was a button on the phone that would set a sleep timer. Instead, I had to make a rule that simply said, ""if this device is turned on between 6pm and 2am turn it off in 90 minutes"". The rule was very easy to do and it worked without a problem. Feeling confident, I then turned to my Amazon Echo. I told the Echo to look for the device and it found it with no problem. I was then able to turn the switch on and off by voice command. I then moved the switch to the bedroom and plugged in the TV. Here's the problem, and this is my problem, the bedroom is at one end of the house and the router is at the other end of the house. I've had sporadic signal issues in the past and the WeMo was no different (point to point it's about 80 feet). The WeMo reconnected to the network when I moved it but I still had the dresser moved away from the wall. Once I moved the dresser back into place I lost the WeMo. I moved it so it would be above the dresser and haven't had a problem since; apparently the 80 feet was OK but the dresser was a deal breaker. This switch certainly meets my needs and I think it's kind of cool to walk into the bedroom and tell the Echo to turn on the television.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works great -- but expect a learning curve! Lousy support.,4.0 ,"You really have to pay attention to what you're doing to get the most out of these WeMo things. They work fine, but can be very picky. Belkin's support sucks eggs. MULTIPLE SITES: Say you have a couple of WeMos at two remote locations hundreds or thousands of miles apart. Both networks have to carry the same SSID. If they don't, you won't be able to control multiple locations from one phone. To make that work you need (a) use the same SSID, e.g., Bobnet. You can't call them Bobnet_1 and Bobnet_2, nor bobnet and Bobnet. They must be identically named SSIDs. Then you'll have to run different sub-nets, e.g. 192.168.1.xxx and 192.168.2.xxx. This works. You can control up to the max WeMos the app will handle at up to 999 locations using this approach. WiFi vs. CELL: Say you are using your WeMo(s) at multiple sites, and you've got them all setup as above. TURN OFF WiFi BEFORE you tap, touch, or try to use the remote WeMo. If you fail to do this, the app will wipe the remote WeMo from your phone and you will have to re-pair it on site when you get on back on that LAN -- because it can't do it over the cell. Re-pairing is a real PIA -- and that LAN is miles and miles away. FIRMWARE UPGRADING: Another issue is firmware upgrading. Be VERY careful where you are physically located if you upgrade the FW, which happens periodically. Fist off, you have to be ON THE LAN where the device you want to upgrade is located at the time of the FW upgrade. Once that happens -- the other WeMo(s) won't work on your app anymore until you get on THAT LAN and upgrade the FW from there. *It also won't power-on, even manually.* So either way, one of them is going to be a PIA until you get back in and get it fixed. I don't know if having the app on multiple phones with one at each location at the time of the FW upgrade would make a difference. We have it on multiple phones, but we are never independently all individual locations, so I've never tried that. POWER FAILURES: I have z-e-r-o issues with the WeMo(s) and power failures. I've seen a lot of these and given a few minutes for the internet connection and LAN to come back up, then the WeMo to connect, it goes right back to where I left it. If I had it powered-off, it reconnects and stays powered off. If I had it powered on, it reconnects and stays powered-on. This is perfect. SUPPORT: For each issue above, Belkin had no assistive support whatsoever. Don't look to Belkin for support -- just assume you WILL NEED to do some homework on your own. They did say it was not possible to use the WeMo at multiple sites from the same phone -- which was wrong. That said, once you get your WeMo(s) setup they are very handy indeed. I use mine to secure electric garage door openers at sites about a thousand miles apart. BOTTOM LINE: The WeMo works reliably and as-designed. I and many others have issues with Belkin's software programming choices, but that can be worked around. I agree -- we should not have to work around it, but at least we CAN.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"I have 4 of them now, make your home smarter",5.0 ,"Once you set these bad boys up, it opens a whole world of smart home opportunities. We started with just lamps. Then over Christmas we plugged our tree lights in to one of these. Using IFTTT at the time, we could tell our Google Home to turn the tree off and on. I dropped a widget on my Android powered phone and could do it even faster, or as we were walking up to the house to admire the tree through the window as we approached. Now Wemo has a direct integration with Google Assistant, so no need for IFTTT to do the same thing. You can also use the Wemo app, although it's slower and clunkier in my opinion. In the winter I plugged a space heater in to this for my garage. Because it turned on/off with a knob instead of digital buttons, I setup another IFTTT to turn on the space heater 30 minute before I planned to workout in the garage. It helped warm things up before I started sweating. The last setup we created was a crock pot. For those recipes that only need a few hours instead of 10, you can turn on the crockpot while at work, and get home just in time for it to finish and still be piping hot. Something our second digital crockpot struggled with. I will say, we have a strong wifi signal, which probably helps, but I have had no connection problems. Setup is easy through the app. And Wemo is generally connected with most smart home devices as they're a pretty common name in that space. Overall I'd highly recommend. We have 4 in our house.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"the product is not bad, the software is",1.0 ,"Let’s be clear: the product is not bad, the software is. As a matter of fact, the software is terrible. You can trust me on this one, because I have 14 different devices installed at home. They are all working, sort of…, but it is not that easy. Setting up is OK, and it’s not the main problem. In the last few years, I had all sort of difficulties, but the last one, is far from preventing me from posting this negative review. I had everything working fine after many, many problems. It took me a few months and contacts with Belkin to get them to work, and then… a firmware update came to mess everything. You cannot avoid the firmware download, so the applications just tell you, that is installing the new firmware and you have to wait. After that happened, all my devices keep showing “downloading” in the app, and you cannot control them. In an effort to get them working, I tried a different phone, because mine is an Android, I thought that maybe my wife IPhone would work. So I downloaded from the Apple store and installed, but the same thing happened. On my phone, I tried do uninstall and reinstall it many times, but the problems persist. Tried on an Ipad, on a Samsung Galaxy Tab2, and 2 different Android phones, but with no success. I even tried to turn off all my house electricity, turn back on, to see if would stop the problem, but it did not. So what point am I? If I open the WeMo app in any of my phones or tablets, all them keep showing the “downloading” message, and don’t let me do anything with them. What was programed, is working, but I cannot access any switch to change anything. There is an “alternative” app, that is far from perfect (much slower), but at least let me control the Switches and Insights, it’s called Memo Widgets. I also have 2 motion sensors, and they trigger the corresponding lights, but I cannot change any setting any more. Hope that this has helped you. Just so you don’t think I am a total idiot, I am an engineer with 35 years of experience in digital technology and I have 117 IPs taken in my home network, aside from the WeMo devices, everything works flawlessly.

"I can say the switch is working great, amazing accurate to programming (dusk",4.0 ,"This lowly little switch is only a piece of the puzzle. A few months after install, I can say the switch is working great, amazing accurate to programming (dusk, dawn, etc.), suffers power fails nicely, and I will probably buy additional switches for other lamps, appliances. It is a 3-wire dry contact relay, not an electronic switch so it will handle other than purely resistive loads and several 100 watts of lighting. It is 802.11x wifi based and needs a good signal for proper function. I have not yet tried enabling off site access. If you have a WeMo system, this switch is a must. The somewhat bigger piece of the puzzle is the Smart Phone (any iDevice or Android) app that controls the switch and any other Wemo device you have. The app is confusing, unreliable and wants it's hands in every part of your smart device - such is why I have not enabled Internet access. It took several hours of setup, update, reset, setup, update, reset to finally get the phone, switch and wifi to agree with each other. Once done it is pretty stable. Do your research well on the installation process and what it is doing, there are web sites and reviews that explain the whole process including what it accesses, why and how to keep it in check. At this point, I am please with the whole system.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Did not work! Returned item,1.0 ,"THIS ITEM DOES NOT WORK! We are a very tech savvy family and could not get this device to sync to our wifi - in fact, the app never even gave us the option.

"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with.Alexa",5.0 ,"I really purchased this light for a bedroom lamp and a living room lamp. You plug it into a wall outlet and you plug the lamp that you want to work off of it into this device. You follow the set up instructions to set it up off of your smart phone. It works with Alexa or the dot. Now when I going to bed at night and I forget to turn off the lights, I just tell Alexa to turn off bedroom or I tell her to turn on or off living room. I don't have to get up and walk all over the house and find switches I'm lamps. It is wonderful. it is so wonderful in fact that I just purchased wall switches to control some ceiling lights in my home. If you know electrical wiring and are careful you can put them in yourself. If not, I would recommend that you hire a licensed electrician to install the wall switches. The spark plugs that I purchased initially don't require any professional installation. You just plug them in to a wall outlet and plug the lamp whatever it is you want to control into the smart one. Once you pair it, you can control it by voice, you can set up a timer, or you can turn your lights on and off from an app on your phone when you are a way from home. I love it and I don't know where I'm going to stop putting them in.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Alexa has a new friend!,5.0 ,"Took a little patience to get it working but actually pretty simple in the end. I was connecting to Echo Dot without the use of the WeMo hub. So going through their website didn't work to configure as a hub was needed. Turns out that their app worked fine. So, connected my phone to the WeMo wifi, found it, configured, added the WeMo skill to Alexa, pasted the MacAddress and worky-worky! Does exactly as I want!

The Good: Doesn't block the bottom socket if you use ...,3.0 ,"After toying with the idea of throwing a relay and arduino nano in my wall socket to automate the socket I decided against possibly burning my house down. I ended up buying the wemo plug and a cheaper alternative and I was impressed with neither. The Good: Doesn't block the bottom socket if you use a normal size plug beneath. Easy to setup and connect to wifi. Automatically recognized and added into home automation by Alexa. The Bad: Drops wireless connection frequently and I return to find the light amber. Sometimes it just needs to be power cycled, sometimes I need to go back into the App and remove the wireless settings and reconnect. It gets super hot. When the switch is on you can hear a super high pitched ringing that slowly drives you insane. If you want to plug in anything that's not a standard 2-3 prong plug, like an AC adapter, below the device you're out of luck. The final verdict. I won't be buying any more wifi switches until the tech comes along more. The outlet I wanted this device for is right next to my couch for a 3in1 reading lamp. The high pitched wine was distracting and there's a basket with blankets in front of the outlet and I didn't want anyone tossing a blanket on this hot device so it's moved to the basement. For that purpose it works fine to control a light and fan that I don't want on 24/7 and when it drops connection and I don't get to reset it for a few days, no biggie.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Nice for Convenience - Not for Critical Applications,4.0 ,"Works fairly well. You will need to pair it up with IFTTT to get the most out of it. I could never get the built in scheduler to work correctly, when it did work it was always an hour off, and most the time it simply did nothing. Using IFTTT to schedule turning the switch on or off works considerably better, and you can use a variety of recipes to trip the switch. Currently I have it set to turn on my air conditioner whenever the outside air temperature goes over 90 degrees. The only hitch is that occasionally my switch will decide it cannot be found, neither by the native Belkin WeMo app, or by IFTTT. The only fix is to unplug the switch for a few moments, then plug it back in to reset it. Obviously this is not something that can be fixed from afar, as you need to be physically present to unplug and replug the switch. Because of this, you could never, ever trust this switch to critical applications. For non critical or convenience applications, however, I recommend it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Seamless install (with a learning curve), and I am thrilled; works exactly as I hoped.",5.0 ,"I bought three of these recently, and I'm very satisfied. Important advice: do not be in a hurry when you install your first smart switch, because there is a small learning curve, and you'll probably thrash around a bit. Thankfully, I had read the reviews here on Amazon, so I knew to expect the setup to be a little bit trying. But after I learned what to do, it was seamless. When you get your switch, just plug it in to a wall outlet within range of your wireless network, and also plug a lamp into it (for testing). Next, connect your smartphone's wifi to the switch's ""temporary"" network, which will be called Wemo.Switch.XXX (where XXX are the last 3 digits of the serial number) instead of to your local area network. Then open the Belkin Wemo App on your smartphone (Android 4.0 or later, or iPhone) while connected to the temporary network. The very first time you connect to one of these temporary networks, it will ask you to help the switch get onto your local area network (LAN), so at that time, you need to type in the name of your LAN (called SSID in the documentation) and its password. If you buy 50 switches, you'll only need to do this once, because Belkin will then store the information in the cloud for any future switches in your house to use. After that, the Belkin Wemo App should switch back to your regular LAN, and then should open a screen when you can name the switch--use the name that describes the device you'll be switching (I named mine Bird Lights, Green Up Light, and Red Up Light, for example). Once that's done, you can (if you wish) create rules for the switch, in case you want to use it as a timer, for example. Also, once this is done, if you have an Amazon Echo device, just say ""Alexa, discover Belkin Wemo devices"", and it should find them within a reasonably short time (perhaps minutes, but in my case, only seconds). Once it has found them, you can command the Echo to turn the switches on/off, by saying, for example, ""Alexa, turn on Bird Lights"" (or whatever your switch is called) or ""Alexa, turn off Bird Lights"". It's that simple. I didn't have a single issue with any of the three switches once I understood the procedure. Note also that soon after installation, each switch wanted to get a firmware update. This is new software for inside the switch that gets downloaded from the Belkin website. It will ask you (when you connect to the Belkin Wemo App) if the firmware update can proceed, and when you give the go-ahead, the switch may be unreachable for a few minutes while the firmware downloads and the switch reboots. Give it 20 minutes to be sure--everything should be back after that. I had none of the problems (reported just a few weeks ago) with Echo--it found them quickly and turns them either on or off as requested. I also put two devices in a group (using the Belkin Wemo App), and the Echo lets me turn them on/off all at once using the group name. Good product. Worth the staggering $40+ per switch cost for those few devices that have special needs. In my case, that was one set of lights that I wanted to come on at sunrise and off at sunset (the Bird Lights), and without needing an actual light sensor. Also, two lamps that sit in corners where it's difficult to reach their switch. I turn them off later at night to prepare my eyes for bedtime--so the smart switches allow me to turn them off without having to climb over furniture just to reach the physical switches of the lamp. Yay for home automation, Amazon Echo, and Belkin Wemo.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great when it works. Frustrating software troubleshooting.,4.0 ,"Nice gadget for use with Alexa. We use the switches to turn on fans and small (low current) electric heaters. When watching TV or when in the bed, it's nice to be able to get Alexa to turn on/off a fan or small heater. Setup is a usually straightforward, but some situations are difficult to resolve. If there is a software update for Alexa or for the WeMo switches, odd things can happen. It is possible that they will all work with Alexa, but Alexa cannot discover them. The WeMo app might word fine for controlling them, but Alexa cannot discover them. And once WeMo couldn't find any switches, nor could Alexa, but Alexa would control the switches. I've been able to resolve these problems usually with a router reset. In case of a problem, I'm never sure if it is with Alexa, Wemo, or my own network. Often there are months of operation with no problems. I don't know if any competing vendors have equipment that is more reliable. Just plan on occasionally having to troubleshoot the devices. And otherwise, enjoy the convenience of the switches.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Not perfect, but useful.",4.0 ,"I saw this and thought it would be perfect to put on the plug that I connect a small electric heater to to be able to turn off when I leave the house, or turn on a few minutes before I need to go in the room where this heater is. The WEMO works fine for this, in fact it works better than the G.E. Quirky Pivot Power Genius which does not seem to be able to work or sense the state of its switches reliably. (Yes, I have one of those too) The Belkin is much better done, because for one thing it has the MAC address of the device printed on it, so setup is easier. The App is easier and more intuitive to use, and it actually works better. However, every time I set a WEMO up, and I have 3 of them now, I always got an error, but then they always started working at some point. I don't really know what happened, but it works. You can turn off and on these switches from anywhere in the world, and with the Belkin you can know whether the switch is on or off ... at least better than you can with the Quirky. One thing I really do not like is the large housing the switch comes in that is so big it really makes the other plug in a receptacle a problem to use. I can only put smaller things in the plug beneath my WEMO because the housing is so large that it covers some of the area my extension cord needs to plug in. That could have been noticed and fixed before they sent this out and there's no need for it that I can see. One of the first devices of its kind, be aware that you need a connection to the Internet to work. The way I think this works is that your cellphone uses the Internet to connect to Belkins's servers somewhere, and the WEMO devices maintain some kind of VPN connection to servers as well. When your phone App connects it must go out on the Internet and then back to your phone. This is why there is occasionally a fairly large lag, and if there is an Internet or server problem it might not work at all - at least for a time. I think it would be nice if the Apps were smart enough to know when they are connected to the home network and to be able to directly communicate with the WEMO over the local network without having to run everything all over the world. Being a network device and having a VPN right into your network it is possible that hackers of the NSA could exploit that and access your home computers, video camera, or other devices you have set up on the Internet.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"When they work, they are great, but I'd say save your money for something more reliable and user friendly",2.0 ,"While I purchased two of these switches from Amazon to complement my Amazon Echo. I must say that I now regret having made this purchase. I have other WEMO switches purchased elsewhere as well, totaling 8. My initial thought about the setup process was that it was a cockamamie process, but it did seem to work. When the switches work, they work quite well. My particular installation has them in spots that are difficult to access, requiring a ladder or crawling on the floor to reach them. This is the rub—they are flaky in that they work quite well almost all the time, BUT they lose a connection and become inoperative. Belkin's ""support service"" is unreliable and in my opinion deceptive. I have had an engineer (reputedly) contact me and ask what times were good for a support call. Obviously, I responded, and never heard from them again. I WANT RELIABILITY, not something I can't count on to work when I want it to work. I have spent a fair amount of money on these and I will be getting rid of them and moving to another product (which I guess I can't mention here).","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
A nightmare,3.0 ,"I really wanted this Belkin WeMo set-up to be the solution to my ""smart"" lighting goals -- specifically for iPhone-controlled outdoor lighting with auto on/off around sunset/sunrise. I started with a WeMo Light Switch. Pretty easy to switch out the current light switch but serious difficulty getting WeMo onto home network and it kept insisting on firmware updates that took much more than the ""up to 10 minutes"" that pops up in the app. But after a few hours I finally got it working and the app is reasonably intuitive to create the on/off rule I wanted. So then I went on to a Wemo Switch and a couple of WeMo bulbs with a Hub. Total 2+week nightmare: first, the bulbs were slow to pair but then when I had them paired and tried to ""group"" them they both went out. As in, no light and no way to get the light to come back, even following the reset procedure on the Belkin web site or trying them in another fixture like a lamp. After an hour call with Belkin tech support (responsive and friendly but just had me run through standard procedures that I had already done), they thought it was a hardware issue and had me request an exchange with Amazon. So I did that, got the new bulbs, and the same thing happened. Belkin confirmed I had followed the correct installation procedures and, after another 1.5 hours on the phone, they agreed to exchange them directly (but I had to argue for 10 minutes that they should pay for the shipping). Two weeks later the replacement bulbs arrive and still grouping causes them to short out (you could even see black streaks inside the bulb. Meanwhile, the WeMo Switch took a while to install and be recognized but it was working. Even for the Switch and initial Light Switch, the app constantly loses them and the only way to find them again is to go off Wifi on the iPhone. Verizon LTE always refinds them, then I can switch back to Wifi. Complete pain. This is the short version of the saga. Not ""Smart"", not easy, not reliable. Meanwhile, two weeks ago I saw that Samsung SmartThings Hub version 2 had come out, read some good reviews, and ordered one. While waiting for it to arrive, I got some Cree Connected Bulbs from Home Depot. TEN MINUTES of installation and I had the bulbs and SmartThings Hub up and running. Bulbs recognized instantly, Hub has no wifi accessibility issues, and on/off response is very quick in the app. So I ordered a GE Smart Switch to expand, installed that on the garage overhead light switch and right away it showed up in the app. SO easy, SO much better than WeMo. More accessories on the way to my house right now. Only downside, just like a CNET review says, is that the SmartThings app is quite confusing. You really have to work at figuring out how to set up rules. But I figure that the key is for the hardware installation to be straightforward and then it's much easier to improve the app in coming months.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works great for me.,5.0 ,"Works great for me with Amazon Echo Dots. The Wemo app is dumb and doesn't always let you see the newest firmware updates even though they are available. Opening the app on a different device (iPhone/iPad/etc) allowed me to get the prompt that new firmware was available to update. Despite that slight annoyance, I'm overall happy because Alexa controls my lights and otherwise the Wemo app works fine. You can even schedule them to come on/turn off at different times, which is kind of an obvious feature but still smarter than a regular switch because you can set it to sunrise/sunset which will constantly be changing throughout the year but it will auto-correct it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"not just a switch, a computer with a wireless transceiver",5.0 ,"Updated on June 14, 2015: I maintain the five-star rating of this product. The original firmware version was WeMo_US_2.00.2176.PVT, which causes a problem with Amazon Echo, but this is fixed with version WeMo_US_2.00.3949.PVT. The problem was that if you ask Alexa to turn on ""the light"", she will, but after about half hour if you ask her to turn the light off, it will not be turned off--unless you re-discover the device, ""turn on"" then ""turn off""; an inconvenient workaround. To update the firmware, open the WeMo app on an Android device and reset the device by pressing and holding the Restart and the Reset buttons for five seconds and then releasing them. The light on the WeMo Switch will blink to green then amber, which means a successful reset. At this point a message will pop up on the WeMo App saying a new firmware update is available. Let it update. The problem then goes away. Original Review: There are 3 steps to get this to work with an Android device (or iOS): 1. Download and install the WeMo app. 2. Search for this switch in available WiFi networks. Just like you'd be searching for your router, and connect to it. 3. Run the WeMo app, which will ask you to pick your actual router and credentials to connect to it. Done. The WeMo App will revert back to your router connectivity and this switch will appear in your list of devices for WeMo. If you have Amazon Echo, simply say ""Alexa, search for my devices"" wait until she finds the switch, then you can say, ""Alexa, turn on the Wemo Switch"". Or, you can change the name of the switch in the WeMo app to something like ""the light"", and let Alexa find it for you.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"It's a bit bulky and buggy, but does the job that I need it to do!",4.0 ,"I had a bit of an issue right out of the box when it attempted to do a firmware update. It seemed like it did download the update, however, the app really never indicated that it was finished. I left it on for well over an hour before finally manually powering it down and crossing my fingers when it came back on. Luckily it took the update, although I was a bit worried that I bricked it. Also a con is the size of the unit itself, It's bulky and takes up the whole outlet. That aside, I have maintained a pretty good wifi connection. I was able to change the name of the unit from WeMo to ""Tree"", since I've since hooked it up to turn on/off my Christmas tree. It works pretty well with Amazon Alexa, however, there was a few times that it disconnected from the WeMo skill app within the Alexa app and I had to use the WeMo android app to recover from this. I have not used any of the ""Rules"" yet, but hope to set this up as an ON/OFF timer in the very near future. Overall, I would have to say this is great device but needs a bit of work on the android app and integration into Alexa.

LOUSY instructions with product and the help file is horrid.,4.0 ,"Original feedback followed by update. Original: Never left a ""1"" on anything before. I programmed the timer after I finally got it to connect to my Wi-Fi. Set to come on from 8 to 11:30 in the evening and 4:40 to 7:30 in the morning. Maybe it comes on, maybe it doesn't. Sometimes it turns it self off in the middle of an ""on"" cycle and then it may or may not come back on sometime later. This morning, it came on at 7:40 when I was leaving the house. UPDATED feedback When creating a rule, do NOT use the ""Away Mode"" in the ""AUTOMATE"" section as a template. I wanted to set the times for when I was away, so I clicked on this rule and modified it. This is the WRONG way to configure this device. ""AWAY MODE"" seems to ignore the times and dates you set. What it DOES do is it turns the switch on and off and random intervals. I did see it come on at my schedule, but every 30 to 40 minutes it would turn off... then a while later... back on again. This is not in the minimal instructions in the box and the help file doesn't help. Instead, use the ""By time, sunrise-sunset"" setting in the ""CONTROL A DEVICE"" section. Then it works perfectly! Do not use the settings under ""AUTOMATE"". That caught my eye and so I kept going back to it. Wrong section. I have it set to come on a half hour before sunset and turn off at a specific time. This is perfect since it gets dark about 5 PM in the winter and about 10 PM in the summer. I am not going to have to constantly change the mechanical timer. Remember, do NOT use the ""Automate"" section for controlling the on/off and you will be happy as a clam.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Arlo + Wemo = Great after a work around,5.0 ,"Before purchasing this item, I tried to determine if it would work with my Arlo motion detector camera and IFTTT (If This Then That website). I couldn’t find a confirmation but I did find a rule in place on the IFTTT website that led me to believe it would work. What I wanted to do was to plug a lamp into this WEMO switch and have it come on (if off) or turn off (if on) at the times that my Arlo device detected motion. The purpose is to deter a would-be burglar at night. I received the WEMO Switch and had no problem setting it up. It connected immediately to my wi-fi and I was able to connect to IFTTT as well. The problem arose when I attempted to setup the rule that I wanted. It continually failed. Apparently the Arlo wasn’t working as I had hoped. However, and I provide this information for others to use if needed, I found that I could have Arlo send me a Google Email and use the Google Email to trigger the WEMO switch. It works perfectly. Now my lamp is blinking on and off all day – I need to re-think having the Arlo on 24 hours a day! But the point is that the switch does work, exactly as it should. I can also easily turn the lamp on or off using the WEMO App on my phone or iPad. Now I plan to see what other security uses I can find for the WEMO products. I don’t really understand the negative reviews. This product works perfectly!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Won't stay connected long enough to set up, wireless stops transmitting.",1.0 ,"Just go the Amazon Echo and was pretty impressed, wanted to hook up this WeMo to it and it arrived today.

"Promising, but headed for the trash bin.",2.0 ,"I say avoid it. Worked fine for a while then units began failing after a few months. Spent a lot of money on this system and I had to pull them all and I am looking at a pile of them right now, and I am not happy about this. Here are some of my experiences: 1) Out of the box they worked great. That prompted me to invest in quite a few of these, plus the coffee pot, the humidifier and the air freshener. 2) WiFi went down, had to do a reset. Wemo units all needed to be reset manually. Unplugging and replugging did it. The app worked fine on my Android tablet. Very nice to hit all the house lights, make coffee, all from my tablet. 3) Several units began acting weird. Some just refused to flip off and on. Invested in Echo to control them. Once I got that it really went downhill, as more and more of the units stopped working. Began flashing, and could not connect anymore to WiFi. Bought some range extenders. No dice. 4) Now none of them work. Bought a cheap push button model (EtekCity Zap) that does 90% of what wemo did. All lying on a table. Doubt I will try them again. Next step once I get sick of looking at them is the trash.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Other than the difficulty setting up (my phone kept reverting back to the house WiFi) it works great. As an added bonus I wanted,5.0 ,"I got this for a light that is hard to reach to turn on and off in my den. Other than the difficulty setting up (my phone kept reverting back to the house WiFi) it works great. As an added bonus I wanted to be able to control it with my Echo, so I did the setup and there it was, the Echo saw it with the name I gave it. The true test was ""alexa turn on the den"" and 1/2 a second later the light went on, ""alexa turn off the den"" and 1/2 a sec later the light went off. What a great product for the price, I was considering building one my self with a photon or a cheaper Arduino but this thing works great. If you have a Echo and need a light or other appliance to control that is difficult to get to then this is for you. Love it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Frustrated and in the dark,1.0 ,"I was excited when my switch arrived before my Amazon Echo. I thought it would be nice to set up the light switch to the car port and in the living room so we could access them remotely to make it look like we were home when we were out or to light up the first couple of rooms when we come home at night. After a couple of hours of frustration I am going to have my first return of something ordered through Amazon. I keep having the following problems: 1. The application will not detect the switch and the only solution is to uninstall and reinstall the application. Reset the switch, and try again. 2. The application finally detects the network for the switch and connect to the switch. In the time it takes to type in Living Room Light as the name for the switch, the phone looses connection to the WeMo network. If I am lucky I can just unplug and plug the switch back in and reconnect. At other times it connects to something called 3G and the only way to get it to connect to the WeMo network is to uninstall and reinstall the app again. 3. The application finally detects the switch, allows me to set my desired name, but looses connection to the WeMo network when it tries to connect to my Wireless Network. If I am lucky, I just unplug and plug the switch back in, redetect the WeMo network, rename the switch, and try again. If not, it connects to 3G and I have to uninstall the app, download it again, reset the switch, and try again. I haven't even tried the light switch yet but if this is how poorly the wall switch works, I am not uninstalling a light switch and wiring in a wall unit just so I can have the same frustration.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works great for a day,1.0 ,"Intermittently does not respond to Alexa. Have this switch hooked up to a lamp. When it ""chooses"" to not work, Alexa responds with a ""sorry, your device is not responding, please check your network connection...""blah blah blah. This has become an everyday occurrence. I have completely reset both systems to factory, installed firmware updates, etc... Works great for a day, then back to the same error. Contacted Belkin tech support, explained everything I did, and of course I get a response back asking me if I reset everything and updated the firmware. This obviously demonstrates that Belkin tech support themselves are pre-programmed, not even reading what I had already done. Now, I could take it upon myself to re-prioritize my Wifi devices, change device leases in the router, etc... but, I shouldn't have to... I bought a product that doesn't state ""only works sometimes, but we can fix it by doing this, this, then this, then that, oh yeah, and then this too, and if you ever change or upgrade your network, you will have to call tech support back."" Not what I signed up for.... Do a Web Search of how many other people are having the same issue before purchasing this product. I got one to try...for this reason, before I bought a bunch... on to the next supplier for me.... I hear Zwave maintains a very reliable connection, so I will try that one next.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
What a disappointment.,2.0 ,"I desperately wanted to like this. I bought two, one for myself and one for my parents. In hopes that they would like it and I would get them more for different rooms of the house. Thankfully I tested mine first. What a disappointment. The point of this is to not have to get up and turn the light on, however it would constantly lose connection with the app. My first clue that it wouldn't go well is when I went to download the app to my phone and the app rated poorly. So they are both getting returned. Oh, and I figured the product would be on the large size, but seriously, this thing is massive. Save your money and buy something else.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
These are great!,5.0 ,"These are great! The very first one was a bit challenging to set up. After a call to customer service, the rep was very helpful and got me up and running in no time. The other ones I bought were a breeze after that. I have them linked to my Echo Dot, and ask Alexa frequently to turn them on and off. Three of these are connected to Himalayan pink salt lamps I have in my home, and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is to ask Alexa to ""turn on all of the salt lamps"" and poof, they are on! I also have one connected to my Christmas tree lights, which I'll find another purpose for when I take it down in a few days. It is also very simple to use the app to turn them on or off, and I was particularly happy that the app worked fine with my Kindle Fire, unlike many other apps that are supposedly available there but no longer supported and won't work at all (like Philips Hue, what a nightmare that one was!). Highly recommend! These were my first foray into the smart home world, and I'm thrilled!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Save On Electricity,5.0 ,"Great, inexpensive product to have on hand. Used to leave lights on all day so as not to come home to dark house in the winter, but with this simple product, was able to program a few light switches to turn on right before it gets dark. Have also programmed some to turn on and off on certain days when I know we'll be getting home late to give the appearance of someone being home. Very easy to set-up out of the box (FYI, it may appear like the app is crashing but it's really just going into the background--still a bit annoying). So, I save on electricity. Can also remotely turn on/off anything (light, radio, etc.) when on travel and not on a predictable pattern.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Does its job well with some nagging things that irk me but don't impact the core functionality.,4.0 ,"Works very well with Amazon Echo/Alexa. The response time is nearly instant (especially compared to my Hue bulbs) and the build quality seems good. My only cons are: The physical design - these plugs take up a LOT of real estate on an outlet or standard surge suppressor and you can't rotate the plug so on some 6 outlet surge suppressors you may get two open outlets (plus the one on the smart plug). Knowing that this is a gadget designed for people who are likely already desperately low on outlets this seems kind of shortsighted. Although this feels substantial enough to run a whole surge through it so perhaps that's why the engineers made that choice but for me controlling a couple lamps on a single plug and a fan on the other it feels kind of silly. The packaging - there's literally four or five pieces of clear tape holding this complicated unfolding box that feels like a lower tier Apple package. Dude. It's an electrical plug. Save some dough, especially when selling through Amazon to nerds like me and knock a buck off the MSRP (I got mine for $20 each which still feels a bit high).","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Smart outlet, great for automation, software isn't perfect but shouldn't hold you back. Good Buy.",4.0 ,"I bought this outlet because I like automation in my home and also in the hopes that some day I might work myself up to getting an Echo or Dot. I really like using it to charge my phone for a few hours in the middle of the night. I like that you can create programs using the software that tell the outlet when to turn on and off. I also like that I can access the outlet through the app from almost anywhere. The down side to this outlet is that the software does not allow you to do a countdown timer. You can set it to start at a certain time and stop after a certain amount of time but you cannot just say ""Be on for 1 hour."" There is a feature that allows you to cycle the timer but I don't find this helpful because it just keeps turning the timer on and off over a set period of time (like 1 hour on and 1 hour off and repeat). The other problem I have found is that I have an old apartment with old outlets (no ground wire - no 3rd prong). So when I plug this thing into the wall I have to plug it into on of those converters first and that makes the device stick out of the wall even further. What that really means is that it sooner or later it falls out of the wall when I have to pull a plug out of the outlet to switch out one charger for another. Overall, it's still a great device and I recommend it for anyone who wants some automation to their home. The down side with the software is manageable, and the other issues are no fault of the device, just the environment I live in. I would recommend it to anyone.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Review of WeMo SWITCH + WeMo App,5.0 ,"Update: 4-5-2-15. Still disappointed that EVERY WeMo product is still mashed into this one huge review section. This update refers to the Belkin WeMo Switch only. A recent firmware update has increased the responsiveness of my 4 WeMo Switches so that all respond promptly to on/off commands. Also, the more aggressive integration of the WeMo Switch with the IFTTT app expands the functionality of the WeMo switch significantly. The app runs smoothly. I see no flaws in this product that would warrant it receiving anything but 5 stars. Again, can not speak for the other WeMo products as do not own any. I just posted the following review on Apple's App Store of the WeMo app and how it interacts with the Belkin WeMo Switch. I'm sure everyone has noticed that Amazon clumps the reviews of ALL the WeMo Products into one giant review section. I am not sure this is best as it is possible that various WeMo products are performing at different levels. For example, I noticed that the WeMo light switch has a fair amount of negative reviews. Maybe that is because it is the most often bought item in the WeMo line. Maybe it is a less admirable product. In my case, I was interested in the WeMo WALL SWITCH. I found it fatiguing to weed through all the reviews finding the ones on that specific product. Anyway...here is my review of the WeMo App in conjunction with the WeMo WALL SWITCH. First, my hardware and software for reference: iPhone 6+ running iOS 8.1.3 (12B466) WeMo Product: 4 WeMo Switches (Kind that plugs into wall outlet) Version of WeMo Switch: VA01 Firmware running on WeMo Switches: WeMo_US_2.00.7166.PVT App Version: 1.10.2 (20022) Here’s the good news: 1. All 4 of my WeMo Switches nicely control the devices to which I have them connected. 3 lights and one TV. 2. I can successfully control all 4 WeMo Switches via my Home Network, via the Enterprise Network at work, and via 3G and 4G. For those reasons the product and app earn 5 Stars. I had to take away 1 star because of the bad news: 1. The app is not refined and often requires several attempts at various tasks in the setup before success is achieved. Luckily I am not a novice user of iOS technology and am comfortable with trial and error. When I set up several of my devices I was told the device was trying to connect to my network. Then it told me it failed and to try again or later. I kept trying and it kept saying it failed. So I stopped trying…only to realize that the Switch WAS connected to my network! The developers need to fix this inaccurate reporting as many folks would give up right there trying to set up the device. 2. I understand the need for firmware updates and am actually glad the company is showing attention to areas of improvement by the presence of firmware updates. My switches needed 2 firmware updates each. Again, that’s fine. My only complaint is after the first firmware update on each of my 4 Switches I received a celebration banner saying something to the effect that 'Your WeMo switch is now running the latest, greatest FW version. Hooray!’ Actually, that was not true at all. There was still one more firmware update and only because I noticed a red dot on the menu bar at the bottom of the app screen did I decide to check if there were more firmware updates. This needs fixing. Each Firmware update takes a while…5 minutes or so. That’s ok. 4. When I experimented and turned on some of my devices from work (Enterprise network) and some of my devices via 4G (parking lot at work) everything went fine. When I got home all the device were on. Great! However, I was unable to turn 3 of the 4 devices off (Home Network). Because of past experience with other buggy apps, I totally closed the WeMo app and reopened it (I didn’t just put it in the background in the recently used app bar). That fixed the problem and I was able to turn off all the devices. Obviously the user shouldn’t need to do this (reboot the app) and some users may not think to do it. This is another area for the developers to refine the app. All in all, I really like this product. I have no qualms recommending it. But novice users would be encouraged to solicit the assistance of an experienced person during setup and remember...my review is with regard to the functionality of the WeMo Wall Switch. Perhaps it applies to the other products. Perhaps not.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great idea but too much trouble to use.,1.0 ,"What could be better than operating your lights remotely so that would-be burglars wouldn't know that you weren't home? (Lights on a timer are predictable, which, I understand, burglars figure out.) However this WeMo smart plug wasn't quite smart enough for my purposes. If the power goes out, you have to set the thing up on your WiFi again. And it's finicky in the set-up. It was too much trouble. It's now in a drawer.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
This works great! I want to get a few more,4.0 ,This works great! I want to get a few more. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it was not easy to set up out of the box. I had to contact support for further instructions that were not included in the box with the product. I had to turn off mobile data first before doing anything. But support was helpful and able to get me all set up. I just wish he would have reminded me to turn mobile data back on after setting it up. I went two days trying to figure out why my phone would not connect to the internet when I was not home. Finally remembered that I turned off mobile data and got it turned back on.

Updated. Finally found the app. Works well. Set security protocols on your wifi.,4.0 ,"Update: I finaly found the Wemo app on my iPad. It is listed under ""iPhones only"" It was easier to install via the App Store app than the Android app. It appears to be working. As an aside note, after installation the app wanted to update it's firmware due to a security vunerability found. They found a vunerability by whereby hackers could hi-jack the device and get on your secured network. That's why I didn't like the Android app with all of those permissions. And my Echo operates the switch nicely. Original post: As of this writing, I can find no free WeMo app for iPad or iPhone in the app store for this switch. They say there is, but there is none. There are paid apps. I tried the free Android app. It wants permissions to my contacts, calendar, photos, calls, camera..and on and on. For a switch??? you've got to be kidding me! I even tried the Android app and it basically makes you connect to the WeMo's unsecured wifi and then try to get it to connect to your personal wifi. A bit convoluted if you ask me, and it didn't work. I have the Amazon Echo (which I love) and wanted to try this as an accessory. I have a smart thermostat which Echo handles nicely. This switch doesn't even work on it's own app. Will look for another brand or system.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Android App Offensively Invasive,1.0 ,"The Android app requests access to Contacts, Identity, Location, and a long list of other phone services it shouldn't need. This is offensively invasive to the point that I consider it unusable. Wemo only supports being used through the phone app, so I guess this thing is useless to me until they fix their app.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
4 stars for now; product may not last depending on the electrical situation in your building/home.,4.0 ,"Wow, so many recent bad reviews, it makes me worry about this product. You need to download the Wemo App on your smartphone first, pair the switch your phone, then to your router over Wifi in order to use this switch. Fail to do any one of these steps and the socket switch will not work. I have read horror stories about having to wait for hours for Belkin tech support from their customer service line after your product no longer pairs with the router, and I do not intend to do that since this is Amazon and what breaks can easily be replaced. I also have Alexa, the Amazon Echo smart device (a voice activated speake with internet connectivity, really) for your home. Pairing it with the Wemo app allows you to use voice commands ""Alexa, turn the lights on"" and ""Alexa, turn off the lights."" Alexa will do as asked and respond with an ""okay"" after the task is completed. If you do not have an Amazon Echo, that is okay too. Using the Wemo App on your smartphone will allow you to use the wifi connectivity to turn the light switch on and off. It is lightning fast in response to pressing the app's power button. I will update this review and possibly drop stars ratings if the switch dies or malfunctions like I have seen in other reviews. Hopefully that will not be necessary.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
We love these!,5.0 ,"We have bought several of these to use with Amazon Alexa. They were great and are easy to set up. We put some in a family member's house as she has trouble with her vision and they make it much easier for her to turn lights on as she's entering the room. We used them for the Christmas tree lights and other lights around the house. It's great to be able to turn on and off lights remotely. We used to leave our front light on all day in the winter time so it would be on when we got home at night. Now we can put it on a timer or simply turn it on when we're on our way home. While in our home, I guess you could call it a bit of a luxury, for the disabled like my family member, this has been a lifesaver! There is another more ""upgraded"" model but the only difference I could see was that it measures electricity usage. That just wasn't something we were looking for. The only con to this is it's size. I noticed recently that they have come out with smaller ones, so we will have to look into that if we purchase any more.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
My only Smart Device that DOES NOT Connect to Wireless,2.0 ,"Bought this to replace the automatic timer on my living room lamp. I was tired of constantly adjusting for changing daylight and wanted something I could flip on my from car so I didn't have to enter in the dark (or turn off from my bedroom when I choose to go to bed early). And it's great...when it works. It is having a lot of trouble connecting and staying connected to my wifi. I have excellent internet speed and a modern router. My Amazon Dash Button and Nest Thermostat (both in the same area of my house as the WeMo) work perfectly. WeMo does not, even after I tried all of their troubleshooting tips (changing channels on my router, etc). So it's just an expensive automatic timer without the extras I was excited about. I'm returning it today.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
This product is the worst product I have ever purchased off of Amazon and ...,1.0 ,"This product is the worst product I have ever purchased off of Amazon and I returning the pair of floaters I purchased. 1st, the APP does not work with Alexa or EVER ITSELF. It will not provide you with a page/the step asking for your home router information instead acting like it is its own network. Tried it on an IPAD, (2 of them) and on my Cell Phone - total piece of garbage. Alexa should be plug and play and I find the fact that AMAZON advertises this works with Alexa without explaining how tortuously retarded and unusable the app is to be reprehensible. I do not normally leave reviews. You, you should run from these like the plaque . . . . interesting, belkin has no support line for their products, I now know why, they suck!! . . . stay away from this product . . .","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
On the fence,3.0 ,"I bought a couple of these and I'll admit I'm on the fence a bit after reading other reviews. I bought them for a couple of lamps to work with the Amazon Echo. Here's what I got... I downloaded the Wemo app and Echo identified with the devices but... one of them works perfectly without any issue and the other works about 85% of the time. Sometimes I'll tell echo to turn on the 2nd one two or three times till it finally works, other times it works without fail. My faulty wall adapter is within 2 feet of the router. Echo, the Wemo wall adapters and my router are all within a 10 foot proximity but I am not yet prepared to blame the product. So far I have had no negative issues with the Wemo app to report, it has worked perfectly with it's products without a problem. I am still in the learning phase of the whole Amazon Echo / smart home thing... but if I can prove it is user error and not the product I will tack on a couple more stars but right now I can't say that's the case. I have purchased the Wemo wall light switch as well which works flawlessly through a wall with plenty of obstruction so I am pretty impressed with its performance.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works Well - Away Mode In Particular,4.0 ,"I use this product for two main purposes. First, when I am away, I use Away Mode to randomly turn my lights on and off to convince a possible intruder that someone is at home. Because the product is compatible with IFTTT, I can also use my motion detecting camera to turn the light on immediately if anyone comes to the porch. When I am not away, I use the WeMo to turn on a fan or old air conditioner when my wifi thermometer climbs to a specific temperature, essentially giving my very old air conditioner a thermostat, therefore saving me money. I have also used the WeMo for my Christmas tree lights. At some point, I will purchase another few outlets so I can do all of these things at once, but at this time, the cost is still a little high to outfit my whole house. I got the unit I have when there was a sale and they were around $20. I am hoping that the price will fall as competition continues from other makers. The only thing keeping me from giving five stars is the price point and the fact that the app and wifi connection can be buggy at times (and I have other wifi connected items in my house that aren't buggy, so I know it isn't my wifi). But overall, I am very satisfied with the product and can recommend it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works well unless using multiple Echos,3.0 ,"Set up was a bit confusing and I have other WeMo products. It always happens with new products and their newer firmware updates. This was really troublesome because even after an hour of ""updating the app/ product"" it still was not finished, and I have a FAST connection. Had to force stop the app, restart and restart my phone. After that it operated as advertised. Connecting to my Echo was easy and works well, just not great. We have multiple Echos in the house and the switch is in the bedroom, connected to an Echo in there. If I give the on command in the living room, and the off command in the bedroom, there is a 50/50 shot that it will not turn on or off as commanded. If I consistently use just one Echo, it works almost flawlessly. For me, I would like to turn the bedroom light on before I go in there, otherwise it would be quicker to use the switch :-) I have now just begun using the on command while walking in to the room and pause 2 seconds for it to turn on the light.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Intermittent connectivity issues,3.0 ,"I use a pair of these with an Amazon Echo to control two lamps in the living room. Despite several firmware updates sometimes it takes issuing a command to turn the lights on 5-6x. Half the time it just works. Most of the time both lamps turn on with the same command (not sure if the Echo is transactionally issuing the command when both are receptive or they just happen to become receptive at the same time). Like others have said, the insane amount of permissions requested by the WeMo Android app is just insane for what the app should actually require to do its basic job, but fortunately with Marshmallow you get prompted as they are used. The actual device setup in the app was flakey at best, but it did get both setup in a reasonable amount of time with only mild frustration. Once setup, firmware updates are fully automatic which is awesome. Hopefully firmware updates will ameliorate the connectivity issues.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Very good product once setup,4.0 ,"If you are thinking about it, just buy a switch and try it out. This is a solid product. I started with just this one switch. I now have 4 and two motion sensors. An energy monitoring switch is on the way. The system is very easy to program. However, setup can be painful. Now that I know the issues, setup is not so bad. First, close and open the wemo app if it is acting funny. Second, the app may say it has problems connecting a device to the network even though it connected to the network. Once its setup however, it is has been great. I dock a star for the setup issues. What I love is that I can change the rules from anywhere. This means if I going on vacation, I can program the front light to turn on and off at various times from the airport and turn off the lights that I don't need off. It modular so you can re-purpose the switches and motion detectors as needed. I use wemos it to control various plug in heaters on the house that just get left on from time to time. If I know we will be using the basement, I can turn on the heater manually a few hours before using my iPhone. Also, I have rules that turn off the heaters at night no matter what so they are no left running. The lights in my house are programmed to respond to motion sensors. My bedroom light turns off at 11pm to remind me to go to bed and turn on a 7am to wake me up if I oversleep. Just on work days. It will also turn on the light if there is any motion in that room for 30 minutes minimum from sunrise to 11pm. If there is motion at the front door a light turns on and I get a message on my iPhone. The light in that room is programmed to turn on at sunset and off at 11pm but will respond to motion from 11pm-sunset the next day. It was very easy to program all this. I wish the motion sensors were battery run since they need to be plugged in outlets. Not putting one in your shed for example unless it has power. The protocol used is proprietary which is sort of a bummer long term. You may need to upgrade the software a few times when you open the box. It seems that the upgrades are not all done at once. Overall, this is a very cost effective way to get into home automation. Its a mass market offering which should make you feel more secure. I have other Belkin products and they have been great. If you are like me you will find that its very empowering to be able to control multiple aspects of your home from your phone with rules. My kids love playing with the app. Given there are no monthly fees, the app is free, and the sophistication yet ease of the rule setup the value of this product is very high.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I could not hate a product more.,1.0 ,"The interface/instructions for this product are awful. I consider myself pretty tech savvy, but there's NO WAY I'm buying these for my 73-year old father given how much trouble my first one of these is giving me...there'd be no way he'd ever get it figured out. The ""demo"" video is one of the most incredibly annoying and useless help videos I've seen for a product. Sending it back and will look for another.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Just OK. I doubt I will buy more WeMo stuff though.,3.0 ,"So far this is just OK. First off, the box seems much larger than it needs to be. I think some of the other wifi outlet controls are smaller. Even the WeMo Insight plug control seems much smaller in size while it seems to offer more features. Secondly, the Android app is pretty poor. Not straight forward or obvious enough to the newbie. And no info at all on the packaging. You must first connect to the wifi offered by the WeMo device to get the process going. Then you have to switch to your main wifi to complete the job. It is very similar to setting up a Chromecast except the app guidance is less good. Third, the last on/off state is not remembered/re-established after a power outage. Belkin says this is for safety and I can see that in some cases. But in others it makes no sense at all. This should be an end user option for each device. Don't hold your breath for it. I am only using it so far for simple on/off from the app or (mostly) via a 3rd party command line interface on linux (which works well enough). So I have not looked into rules and schedules. But one thing I that is NOT clear is what happens to rules/schedules after a power outage if there is no wifi available. Do the rules/schedules persist over the power outage? If there is no wifi, how is current time established? Is there an internal clock with some form of battery backup to survive power outages? If not, then without wifi schedules are likely to fail after power outages since internet time cannot be reached. One would expect much better from the likes of Belkin. So in a way this is a real disappointment.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I'm a happy camper!,5.0 ,"Edit 12/10/16 - Added a 4th basic switch tonight (Amazon Warehouse purchase) for the Christmas tree and in order to connect, I needed to restart my phone. Otherwise, it went just as simply as the others. Enjoying the automation so much, I broke down and ordered an Echo tonight, too. Think Hue light strips are next. I discovered these switches while researching the Echo. Didn't get the Echo but now have three basic WeMo switches, one from Home Depot and two from amazon. After studying reviews, I went with the basic switch rather than the Insight and I love them. Turning out lights AFTER I've left the room means no more tripping over dog toys or the cat. I especially like the ability to turn on lights remotely when I'm going to be late. Connecting to my Note 4 was simple. Firmware downloaded without incident each time I connected one. Definitely getting one more switch for the Christmas tree!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

She has the Amazon Echo (which she loves) but was using a clapper on one her primary lights in the living room. The clapper is okay, but man, that things been around for like 25 years and I don't think the technology has improved. You had to run around her living room clapping away until the light would finally cut on. My mom lives by herself and by the time she gets home from work it's pitch black out (in the Winter) so something more effective seemed like a necessity. So, once set up, this thing works great. She can just talk to Alexa and ask her to turn the light on, or she can turn the light on with the app on her phone before she even walks into the house, OR, if she hears something downstairs while she is sleeping, she can talk to the Echo remote which she keeps in her room and have the light come on. This is all awesome. The downside is that set up is not easy. If you buy this for your parents or grandparents, be prepared to come set this up for them. Setting up everyone's technological devices in the family has somehow become my job by default, and this still took me 30 minutes to get it working. 40 if you count the snack I had to have halfway through the process. There is a ""quick start"" guide included in the package (which, good luck opening the freaking package by the way) but it is not enough to get you started, and it certainly isn't quick. It essentially just directs you to download the app, and then the instructions are in the app, which isn't a great user experience because then you have to toggle back and forth on whatever device you are using between the instructions in the app, your wifi settings on your device, back to the instructions, back to the app itself (with instructions closed) back to wifi settings. Pain in the rear. Anyway, once this was set up it was awesome. My mom only has a lamp plugged into it, but I imagine the possibilities with this are pretty endless. So, long story short, if you are relatively familiar with network setup stuff, or you know someone who is and they owe you a favor, this is definitely worth the setup, but out of the box this is not something that just anyone would be capable of setting up. Now I just hope that if my mom decides to move this plug to a different outlet, we don't have to go through the whole process again.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
spend $10 more and get the WeMo Insight instead.,1.0 ,"It will work remotely and let you program your lights to come on and off only. This unit will not act as a dimmer. The insight by Belkin allows you to also monitor your electric usage and has several other functions that make it much more desirable than this model. The insight allows you to record the usage of whatever it is plugged into it. It will also tell you how much it cost to run whatever is plugged into it and it can send usage spreadsheet files to your email. The insight also tells you when things turn on like a space heater. Each time it turns on the insight outlet via the WeMo app it van be set up to send an alert to your phone. My point is, the spend the extra $10 and get something that has tremendous multi function capability. These units are handy as timers and you can check them remotely to insure they are working.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
The Jury Is Still Out,3.0 ,"First the good: It's easy to install, albeit somewhat mysterious.. It works, so far (ten days). The app (iOS) works OK - usually. The not so good: The biggest issue, in my case, is the necessity to have local access to my LAN to set up the app on a new or different device. If you're not at ""home"" there is no way to do this so you can control the WeMo remotely. With competing products you set up an account with a password and the device information is stored there. Adding another controlling device is simple as long as you remember your account information. WeMo also sets up an ""account"" somewhere but this is not visible to or accessible by the user. One of my homes is empty for eight months of the year. I want to be able to turn lights on and off at random times. When everything is working correctly it's fine. If I were to lose my cell phone or trade it in (I'm on the AT&T Next plan) I will have no way that I'm aware of to ""teach"" a new one about WeMo from 997 miles away. I also had some problems with firmware updates. With two of the units the update took a very long time and at the end said ""Update failed"". The WeMo is ten feet from my router with a very reliable 50 Mb/sec internet connection. After several tries I checked the firmware version and it was the same as the first one I updated which completed normally. They also seem to work fine so possibly the ""error"" was the error message. We'll see.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
By Far Easiest to Set-up Remote Switch Ever!,5.0 ,"I don't understand the bad reviews, this is by far the smoothest and simplest (and I've tried every remote relay and switch you cant think of) remote switch you can think of. The app setup was a breeze (it instantly found my Wemos and it worked right away).. No complex set up with DHCP, Remote or Local IPs, gateways or none of that complicated stuff was needed to get it to work. The other awesome thing, is not only does it work right away from your WiFi network, it works remotely.. I was surprised that it had this feature automatically, without any set up on my part. This means you can control security, and turn things on and off (cameras, lights, security features, recording a show) from work, or even if your miles away on vacation. This may not seem like a big deal, but I've tried a lot of Chinese vendor and US vendor remote relays and IR devices, and spent hours if not days trying to get them to work, and they had glitch after glitch.. With the WeMo, it was so easy (just opened the app and it seemed to set all this up right off the bat).. My only gripe, is I wish they had more than one electrical connection. They take of a lot of horizontal space, so they fill up nearly 3 electrical receptacles on my electric strip. This also makes it difficult to place multiple WeMos on the same strip as well.. Perhaps they have one with 2 to 4 electrical outlets already, but didn't see one when I purchased this one..","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Five Stars,5.0 ,"A+ Long after purchase, this product has continued to flawlessly allowing me to remotely reboot my computer system and log back in when it has locked-up. WeMo has also pushed out two firmware updates since my original purchase showing they stand behind their product after the purchase. Firmware updates are automatic from the app after you approve the new firmware availability update message... i.e. no complicated steps of downloading the firmware file and manually installing like most other peripheral firmware updates. The user interface is clear, simple to use, and attractive. If you are using this WeMo item to reboot a computer remotely and wishing to log back in, to be able to log back in after powering down remotely, many computer systems require that you -quickly- press the power button on the WeMo app again ***shortly*** (meaning as soon as you see the power button on your WeMo app change to power-off) to keep the computer in an on state allowing you to log back in too. If I press the off button the WeMo and wait too long, the computer will remain in an off state even after the WeMo is turned on again, meaning you would then have to physically be at the computer and press the computer power button to reboot. This is -not- a WeMo issue but an issue with the computer system's BIOS. If that's confusing, think of it like this: if you wait to long to power back up the wemo, it is like you pushed the power off button on your computer. If you cycle the WeMo off/on quickly within one second, the computer reacts as if you instead pressed the reset button, allowing the computer to remain on. So, if your cycling of your WeMo power is with a goal to log back into your computer remotely, if you don't do it quickly, you're merely cut the power to your computer by turning off your WeMo and the computer will remain off even when the WeMo is turned back on from the app and you will be unable to log in remote because the computer will remain off.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Cool things: 1,3.0 ,"There was a ""Today's Deal""/Lightning sale on this. It took a bit to get up running because of some Wifi issue (which Wemo acknowledges and tells you the workaround), but once it worked, well...it works. Cool things: 1.) Alexa enabled. I can tell Alexa to turn the switch on and off. 2.) Android App for it. I was enable to have a timer on this thing. What would have been cool is if Alexa could ALSO turn off the timer. But she was unable to recognize it. So I'm assuming the record keeping of the timer could only be done from Wemo app you enabled it from. Oh well. For the price I paid, I'm happy with it. it's a good starter for somebody who does not have any ""smart"" home appliances/experience as it was easy to use, it works, and it gives me ideas on how to ""Alexa enable"" the house as I move forward. With time, I'll move forward with other purchases, but will start looking for appliances that smart enough to turn themselves on and off via sensors and some minor programming (i.e. turn on the outside lights when the sun goes down, and turn it off at 10 pm).","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Nerd Heaven When Paired with My Echo {Updated 10-27-2017},3.0 ,"Sure, I could have gone with a remote control wall plug but that would have added another remote control to the pile in my bedroom and I'd likely turn on the TV or stereo. I could also have gone with one of those clappy devices but they've been around forever and anytime I think of those things I picture the old lady from the original TV commercials from the 80's. No, I have an Amazon Echo and I want to be able to say ""Alexa, turn off 'The Light.'"" when I'm ready for bed. Yes, I named the device 'The Light' my imagination was bored. Feel free to post better names in the comment if you can think of any. Set-up was honestly as easy as the pictographs on the card that comes with the device and the instructions you scroll through after installing the WeMo app. Even being disabled and working from a walker plus having to go hunt down the router's password it took maybe ten minutes to get up and working with my Echo and the switch did a firmware update while I was in the shower. I'm in nerd heaven being able to tell my Echo to turn on and off my bedroom light. That's just too cool. Update - For the most part the last two year have been reasonably problem free. Tonight for no good reason my Wemo switch acted up. Nothing I could do would resolve things. Amazon support ran me in circles. It took over an hour and I had to rename my switch. It was a nightmare.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Buy it if you want a cheap frustrating product that simply doesn't work as advertised,1.0 ,"This product simply doesn't work. I purchases two. One of them, I was able to fully setup and the second one I was able to setup but could not enable remote access. BOTH devices became 'Not Detected' in the Wemo app almost immediately after setting them up. I restarted my router and reset the devices after (initally, a soft reset and then a hard reset). I still was unable to get them to connect. After manually turning on the devices, they would be detected in the wemo app for a few seconds (enough time for me to quickly turn them and off a few times) and then return to the 'not detected state'. I have other devices connected to my network which work flawlessly including 2 of the Amazon echoes a nest thermostat and EVEN a wemo insight switch. These were very disappointing.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great...when they work...,3.0 ,"I have two WEMO plug-in switches and one WEMO wall switch. One of the plug-in switches doesn't work on a broadband connection. I've reset the device several times, enabled remote access, etc., but it still doesn't work. Read through the Amazon reviews and check out the WEMO Community boards on the Internet. Many complaints and low ratings. Apparently, Belkin customer service is even worse. This is a buggy product. Find another brand of wireless switch. WEMO switches are not worth the headache. I'm returning mine to Amazon. UPDATE: Well, I decided to keep the switches and see if I could get them to work. Turns out there are a couple of things that make things easier. First, patience. It takes several minutes for these things to reset. For the wall switch, you have to push the right button, followed immediately (for five seconds, until the light begins to flash) by the left button. Both are in the front of the switch toward the bottom. On the plug-in switch, push the button on top while inserting it into the electrical receptive AND CONTINUE PUSHING THE button until the light begins to blink. In both cases, you then need to wait up to a couple of minutes until the light begins to flash alternating colors. At that point, the switch's WiFi designation should show up on the network list on your phone. Connect to the switch, then open the Belkin WeMo app and finish the set-up. (You need to install the app BEFORE you try to set up the switch. You can't set these things up on a 802.11ac network; it has to be 892.11n. Also, the network name (SSID) must be being broadcast. I typically don't broadcast the SSID; to set up the switches, I changed the router setting to broadcast, then changed it back to no broadcast after the switches were working. Another tip: although you need the Belkin app to set up the switchs, there is a much better app for controlling them. It's available in the Google Play Store. (I don't know if it's available for iOS devices.) Look for ""WeMo Manager"". It sets up a server on your phone, so you don't have to use the Belkin server. Much faster response time, and the app developer is wonderful with customer service. Finally, I have an Amazon Echo, and I've never had a problem with it not recognizing the switches. Go to the Echo app; in Settings, under Connected Home, you can have Alexa search for your devices. Sometimes, if she's being ornery, you may have to ask her to search twice to pick up all of them. Hope this helps. I'm still giving this product three stars. The switches get a four, Belkin's terrible customer service gets a zero, but I'm feeling generous today, so overall, three stars.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Initial setup was very easy. Plugged them in,3.0 ,"Initial setup was very easy. Plugged them in, detected right away, and I was able to control my lamps. No knock there. So far, I've had it for 2 weeks and I already had one issue where creep up twice. The devices just show up as not detected by my Echo or the WEMO app. First time, I unplugged the WEMO plugs and plugged them back in and they started working. Less than 48 hours later, they showed up as not detected again. The issue, I believe, was because my router (by default) has Multicast routing (IGMP Proxy) disabled as well as Efficient Multicast Forwarding (IGMP snooping). As soon as I enabled those, my WEMO devices went from Not Detected to online and I could control them. I am using an Asus RT-N66U router with the latest firmware as of 9/25/16 3.0.0.4.380_3831 I don't know what other issues will crop up in another 2 weeks, but when they work they are great. When they don't work - you wonder if it's worth the hassle and expense. This is me dipping my toe into home automation, and if I have anymore issues with these simple devices i'll probably wait another year or two until I invest anymore into any home automation equipment","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"Great potential, but bad glitches in the app",2.0 ,"This is a product with great potential, but unfortunately, its software is pretty poor at this point. I have an above average capacity for learning and using technology, and have had several issues with the glitchy app and firmware. When you first get into syncing the app and the outlet, it will probably tell you that there are updates. I updated this thing exactly as the instructions said to, it ran the update, cycled through the power-down that it warns you about, and then I restarted it, only to get the exact message saying that there is an update. I tried to run the update on this like 3 or 4 times, following the instructions exactly, and it keeps thinking that the firmware in the outlet is outdated. Also, it won't let me set rules (parameters) for the timer function. I can get into the menu to create the rules, but then it never lets me save them, saying that it requires an update (which I already tried multiple times) and that it can't save at this time. On top of that, every now and then, when you try to just use the basic on/off function from the phone, it will show a yellow circle and not connect for whatever reason. This is not a very frequent problem, but still annoying. Sadly, the timer fucntion was the main reason I bought this, as my lamp plugs in behind a dresser, and I was hoping to avoid messing with a mechanical timer that I would have to constantly lay on the floor and reach under the dresser to change. I think this could be a 4 or 5 star product when they iron out the issues with the app, but at the moment, it's nearly unusable for me.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works great-with or without Alexa! Make sure you download the correct app...,5.0 ,"I bought this to help control lights when I cannot easily reach them or cannot get up (medical), and because it can work with Alexa. I read the instructions, which were somewhat minimal. Basically, download the app and follow the instructions there. The important point here is to look at the icon in the instructions and pick that one when you go to the app store. I opened my apple app store, put in ""wemo"" for the search, but the one that came up looked different and cost $1.99! The one shown in the pic did not show up at all. Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened to me at the app store, but, then again, I knew what to do. I had to go online using my browser, put ""wemo app"" in the search, then select the apple app result, and it takes you right to the one shown in the set-up instructions, and it is free! Don't ask me why...?! Set up did not take too long, except there was a firmware update that did take a while to finish. Just put it down and come back to it. I had no problem with Alexa identifying and connecting to it using the Alexa app under ""smart home"". The only ""problem"" I had is that I want to tell Alexa to ""turn on the living room light"" but instead have to say "" turn on the living room wemo"". Might be a way to change that, but there is no directions for that. But I am also new to Alexa, and need to read up more in how to work it (I can play music, but not much more!). I found that you can also control the switch through the Wemo app. There is a big circular computer- like button that is the power button. Press on/press off! Very simple! I bought a second one that I plan to put in a different room, so I hope that will go well, too.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"WeMo app needs updating, otherwise works well",3.0 ,"I love me some smart products, so since Alexa had a $20 deal, I thought, why not? The device can in a nice package. The plug itself is larger than expected, sturdy, and pairs easily with your phone. Once paired, works pretty seamlessly. However, it almost takes over the entire outlet, so using another plug on the outlet is difficult. I have had a TP-Link plug, and this works better. Plus, it has IFTTT support. The WeMo app, however, needs work. The part of scheduling, naming, etc of your plug works easy enough. Unfortunately, syncing to IFTTT, using the device remotely, and connecting to an account are MUCH more complicated on this app than on others. It makes the overall experience pretty buggy. I'm hoping with the new WeMo minis and app improvements will make the experience a lot better,","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Easy to use and convenient. Great for home safety too.,5.0 ,"I have owned my ECHO for a while but hesitated to try the smart home products as I was not sure which to select. This item came up on a deal before Christmas and with lots of positive reviews I thought it was time to get my feet wet. I have 2 units and have both in use with lights. Set-up was pretty easy with the downloaded app for android. Some slowness connecting the second unit, however nothing major. What I love is that I can now turn on lights if we go out and I forget to leave one on. I love the away mode option with random on and off - when we go away, this means a lived in look to the home. Also, what a great add-on to our alarm system - should if ever go off, turning on lights would add another incentive for anyone breaking in to just get out. Great product that I hope works well over time - if so, going to be one of my better purchases.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Buggy, but does what I need",2.0 ,"12/28/2015 It was working well for a few weeks but I found some new glitches. I setup mac address DHCP on my router so it would always get the same address, but that caused more issues. Also, when I reset my router one day, it knocked the WeMo offline and I had to do a full setup again. 12/5/2015 Once or twice a week it stops responding. Looking at the device there is a flashing light and it needs to be rebooted and sometimes reconfigured. My motivation behind picking the WeMo was needing a device that would turn on a lamp at sunset, but would also interface with my Kodi media player running on a Raspberry Pi 2. The lamp has a 40W equivalent CFL that offers enough light for getting around when the main lights are off. It's also in the room with the TV and if I was watching a movie I would get up and turn off light manually. Being the lazy tinkerer that I am, I wanted a way to automate the light. Kodi has a plugin for WeMo that will turn the WeMo light off and on based on playback. SETUP Right away I was unable to complete the setup. It was not connecting well to my wireless. I tried their listed troubleshooting, even gave customer service a call but was offered nothing beyond the troubleshooting I already tried. I finally figured out it was my guest wireless network that was causing the problems. Having two strong signals at 2.4 GHz was causing a conflict. Once I turned off the guest network, setup was easy. Even after the setup, I was unable to enable my guest network without killing the WeMo. I now have my guest network on only the 5GHz band and this is not causing a problem. I offered this solution to Belkin customer service but the guy in India I was talking to did not understand what I was talking about. FUNCTION It works as advertised, and the app is easy to use. I'm only using this with one WeMo device in the house, but overall i'm very happy with it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Avoid..,2.0 ,"Smart plug will eventually setup but is predisposed to lose network connectivity. Also response time from when a command is given and the light switches on or off is excessive. This contrasts sharply with the TP-Link Smart plug- which maintains connectivity and has lightening fast response. Both smart plugs require a 2.4 GHz network, though your cell phone can remain on a 5 GHz network when controlling the plug. Both plugs support Alexa well.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works but the Insight Switch may be worth the extra money. Security TBD.,3.0 ,"The device was properly labelled with its MAC address, simplifying use on a WiFi network that does not broadcast its SSID and that uses MAC filtering to restrict access. The app has a feature to Save network settings to simplify successive device setup. Where to? The cloud? Just the phone? The settings include security type and password. This is a significant security breach if the data is anywhere other than the phone or the WiFi switch. Nothing tells you where it is saved, nor how to direct that it be forgotten. There have been times where the app has not had access to the switch. (e.g., if unplug/replug the WeMo Switch) Briefly re-enabling SSID broadcast (can leave MAC address filter in place) might help with that, but it may also be coincidental with time moving forward and some software action in the background that the user is not aware of. The Insight Switch seems to be quieter when toggling power, and though chunky is smaller in the sense of not being as tall.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
WeMo App is a nightmare,1.0 ,"WeMo switch - I'm giving this one star because although they do work the app and the setup is a nightmare. I purchase 2 of these to use with my Amazon Echo. And NO the Echo is not the problem. 1. The WeMo app is crap its only a few steps but getting the app to find the device and your router is very difficult. 2. If you have a android phone you have to disable Wi-Fi settings so the app can get through the second step. And if your successful the first try good for you. 3. I had to run the setup several times for each device to get mine to work (1 to 1.5 hours) 4. After all that and you finally get your devices connected, the app will ask you to update the device firmware witch I thought at the time would be a good thing, the only problem is when it starts the update it only found the 1st device and never tries to update the 2nd, after it finishes the app will ask you every time you open it to update firmware. I'm afraid to unplug 1 device to get them both updated, they may not work when I plug them back in.

Great product when paired with an Amazon Echo...,4.0 ,"I've ready many reviews of Belkin's WeMo products, which were not all that flattering. I too had some issues a few years back, but I have to say that a lot of these bugs have been squashed since 2013. As for the many other issues that are current (2016), I have been fortunate to not have them. I decided to pick up the Switch Smart Plug to supplement my Amazon Echo, which so far has been great. Setting up the device didn't go the first time, but a quick unplug and start the process over took care of it. The needed WeMo app needed to set up, has much matured in the backend, but the user interface has pretty much remained the same. It's easy to use and not difficult to get around. For the most part, you set it an forget it. I've had a few WeMo devices running for over a year and I haven't had any issues, so I'm hoping the switch will do the same. It's my opinion that while on it's own, works wonderfully, especially on vacation mode or simply setting timers for daily cycles. It's further enhanced when paired with the Amazon Echo, essentially giving it the ability to use voice commands. This pair I would highly recommend. As for an individual product, it does well, but it's still a bit pricey for a switch.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Potentially nice product ruined by terrible app.,2.0 ,"This could/would/should be a nice product. Sadly the app makes this product bad, if not downright unusable for most people. It is riddled with lock ups, crashes, poorly designed UI, and even forces you to relaunch the app to setup devices (the ""setup"" process is just a tutorial). It took a ridiculous amount of tries on multiple devices to get this to work. Fortunately once your devices are discovered (AND setup) it seems to work pretty well, and flawlessly with amazon's Alexa. My tip: use an older device (or rather older version of android) with an older version of the app, so if you're using an Amazon tablet for once Amazon's delay in updating (android version and app versions) is in your favor. Belkin have done a terrible job not only with giving needed updates, but also giving updates that actually make the app better or more usable. Frankly if I were to buy another smart outlet it would be another TP-Link.

After moving it I could not get it to link to my WiFi nor Alexa. I had to call the company because there were no Troubleshooting instructions of what to do if 'xyz' happens. The girl on the phone walked me very slowly and deliberately through the whole process of rebooting the plug and getting it set up. Easy Peezy then! Wish that had been in the directions as I could have done it myself. Have not had a problem ever since - AND I have even lost my Internet connection several times since (due to weather, etc). I do wonder though, how is this really any different or better than a run-of-the-mill timer? CONS: It's big - takes up 1/2 a normal sized power strip or an entire outlet.

Great in general but needs reset every week or two,3.0 ,"I bought this to work with my amazon echo and to voice control one lamp. The setup was pretty easy but you need to follow the instructions. Once set up, Alexa can control the switch. There is maybe a one second delay but that's fine. I really like the switch but: It just loses connection every one or two weeks and I need to reset the device and start all over. This is somewhat frustrating. Also, it will not detect or connect to your 5g home wireless. It still works even when Alexa is on the 5g, but I have no idea how. But here is what I did: Connect to wemo switch using your phone. It will ask for a wifi. I gave it my 2.4G wifi network and password (I have time warner and both networks come with the router). Once it connected there, the app switched me back to my 5g wifi on the phone. For whatever reason, Alexa was also able to find and control the light, even though it should be on a different network. So yeah, no idea how it works but it does. I hope that makes sense. Just bought a second switch but from a different seller. This one I could not make work at all. For whatever reason, it does not connect to the network and keeps timing out with ""Password incorrect"" for my wifi. I tried on both, IOS and android, reset the switch a few times but no success. Hoping that Belkin support can help. Update: Belkin support was really great. They called me and we did troubleshooting over the phone. My issue (second switch cannot connect to wifi) was resolved by unplugging the first switch during the setup of the seconomy switch. Everything works properly now. Very happy and huge thank you to Belkin support.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great once set up is done,4.0 ,"I have 2 of these controlling different lights in my home via Echo. They work great once you get them set up; however, the directions are lacking and setup is not as easy as it could be. I would have given 5 stars had instructions been better. I had to google to find answers to some of my questions and I actually found the answers in Amazon reviews, not the WeMo website. One thing I was unaware of was how to reset the switch. One of the switches stopped working and I simply could not get it to pair with my Amazon Echo. After researching online, it was recommended to reset the switch and restart the pairing process. The reset/restore button is on the very top of the switch (above the pair button and light). Here are the directions to restore. Once I figured this out, I can quickly get the plugs repaired when needed. FYI, I have only had to do this 2 times so it is not frequent that they go down. Here are the reset instructions: Step 1: Unplug your WeMo. Step 2: Hold down the Restore button (labeled on the top). Step 3: While holding the Restore button down, plug the WeMo into a power outlet and continue to hold the button down for at least 15 seconds. Step 4: Release the Restore button. It should take about 45 seconds for the WeMo to restore and reboot. It will blink blue and amber when finished.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
This is not a finished product.,2.0 ,"This is not a finished product. It is completely hit-or-miss as to whether it will work and is very finicky depending on your network hardware, settings, etc. In troubleshooting, support will tell you things like ""you need to remove any special characters from your WiFi keys"" and ""make sure your router is on channel 1 or 9"". What kind of device forces you to re-architect your network around them? I had one of these that actually worked well when I first installed it, so I bought a second one. That second one works locally but will not pair with my Amazon Echo or work from outside my home network. It has been very frustrating; I've spent probably 6 hours troubleshooting it and talking to their support and am about ready to give up and ship it back. It's probably the first time I've had to do that; normally with enough finagling I can get these types of things working. Anyway, I do NOT recommend this product and eagerly await something more stable hitting the market. Belkin and WeMo should be ashamed of themselves for selling this as it is.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Incredibly Convenient,5.0 ,"We have had two of these for about 6 months now and just got our third. They are easy to set up (read the directions first though, set up is not completely intuitive). They function well, we have never had a failure to function, and work with multiple devices and platforms. We use the IFTT software and Alexa to do things like: lights turn on at sunrise, lights turn on when Alexa alarm goes off, lights turn on or off when our cell phones connect or disconnect from our wifi (we're arriving or leaving home), and of course we use Alexa to verbally turn the lights on or off. If the wifi on/off system doesn't work (it's always ""worked"", but if someone else leaves our house after we have for instance), we can easily use the app on our phone to make sure electricity is not being wasted. The app also allows us to set up ""vacation mode"" so it appears as if we are home when we are not. We are now entertaining getting more for things other than lights, might even get their crock-pot!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"The Belkin WeMo switch is simple, easy, and it integrates flawlessly with the Amazon Echo.",5.0 ,"Set-up and use of this Smart Plug is flawless. The Belkin WeMo app is simple, and the set-up instructions are quick and easy to follow. Once the smart plug is set-up, it can be turned on and off through the app anywhere there is an internet connection. My favorite part is that you can add photos and a name to each plug. This is the device of this type that I have owned, so I can't compare it to others like it, but I can't image any other being much better. The WeMo switch also works perfectly with the Amazon Echo, and there was virtually no set up. Alexa automatically detected the device, and I can turn it on or off by name. Depending on your budget they aren't exactly cheap, but once you realize the benefits and convenience of owning a smart device, it's worth it. I have already purchased a second one, and I plan on adding more smart devices to my home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great Device.,5.0 ,"I use WEMO for home automation and connecting to Amazon echo. When working with all network devices, you may or may not encounter issues. What I do is some research in case I run into issues. Here are some of my notes. RESET WEMO Resetting or restoring your WEMO device to its original settings may be required in the following scenarios: • Setup has failed • The router settings have been changed • The WEMO device is • not detected by the WEMO App • The WEMO device is not detected by the WEMO App after firmware update • The WEMO device is blinking blue after firmware update FORGET WIFI Your android device may not reconnect to the WEMO if the WEMO has no internet. So you need to forget or delete the WEMO wifi connection. • To delete a saved Wifi network from your phone or tablet, all you need to do is go to the Wifi section of your settings menu. Find the network you want to get rid of. Long press it, then chose ""Forget."" ROUTER If you haven’t upgraded to a new wireless router in a few years, you might want to seriously consider it. That old router may still be working, but newer ones will give you better Wi-Fi. New wireless routers support new wireless networking standards that offer higher speeds and less interference. You aren’t getting everything your new laptops, smartphones, tablets, TV streaming boxes, game consoles, and other network-connected devices have to offer if you’re using an outdated router. That’s why things like streaming Netflix in HD over Wi-Fi just aren’t possible if you’re using too old a router. WIFI SIGNAL Check your signal strength. The performance of a Wi-Fi wireless network connection depends in part on signal strength. Between a computer and wireless access point, the signal strength in each direction determines the data rate available on that connection. TROUBLESHOOTING Check out WEMO support article.

Green or pink? Perseverance.,4.0 ,"After a dozen attempts to set up, I finally connected to Wi-Fi. It works as advertised with one exception. My Switch only functions if it is in the same room as my router. Otherwise, it says out of range. Unfortunately, I bought this to use in another room, on another floor. I had to use two iPads and my Kindle to finally set up / connect to Wi-Fi. What if I did not have a Kindle? It actually helped more than the iPad. Another area of frustration was this: download the WeMo app. Ok, which one? The green app or the pinkish app? I see both, but I could not locate both in the App store. I could only download the green one on my iPads, iPhone and Kindle. All devices now operate my Switch, and the rules I created were successful. Four stars = I like it. Perseverance paid off. I deducted one star for the cumbersome connection and confusing app selection. Belkin does not control my Wi-Fi strength, but it can specify which app I select. I have not even attempted to install my Light Switch yet downstairs. I fear that it may be out of range as well, so avoid the aggravation, I'm thinking.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great way fo control A/C units when travelling!,5.0 ,"We purchased two WeMo switchs - one for each 120 volt air-conditioner in a smaller condo unit. Once installed, these work very well - allowing us to turn the A/C on early when returning from travels. Getting the ATT Uverse modem to recognize the unit was not so easy. Three ports (on the modem) must be open: port 80 = http, port 110 = POP3, port 443 = SSL. Thanks to my son and his engineering friends at work, I learned about these Modem ports. One note: if the power shuts off (storm or otherwise), the WeMo switch may not recognize the internet command without a reset. This has only happened once to date.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I love it!,5.0 ,I bought 4 of these to work with my new Amazon Echo. Do to some user error on my part the installation took longer than I had hoped. The key is to install the We Mo app on your phone 1st and sync all of them with that app before attempting to link them to your Echo. Once I got it all set up I can now turn lights on and off using a voice command while at home and I can control the lights from anywhere that I have a connection to WiFi or to a cell tower. Handy for turning the lights on before arriving home at night. I love it!,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I thought they had gone bad. But not so fast,4.0 ,"Im using several of the Wemo switches and all seem to work well. However on occasion they will have to be reprogrammed after a power failure depending on the length of the outage. On one occasion two of my switches simply wouldnt come back, even after factory reset. I thought they had gone bad. But not so fast. I saved them in a drawer and after getting a new cell phone and installing an updated version of the app, they came back. My fault for not uninstalling and reinstalling the app on the older device. It was recommended if factory reset failed. All in all Im very happy with the products. I own 2 switches, 1 insight switch which works well for showing power consumption, and just ordered one of the new mini's. Thanks Belkin.

Won't stay connected.,2.0 ,This device has possibilities you can remotely connect from anywhere using the app. You can set timers for auto on auto off. It can connect to Alexa and use your voice to turn on any device you plug in to it. It connects to your wifi and you name the device that's connected. It's so simple to use I bought three. Now the only problem is it doesn't stay connected. You would constantly have to unplug it and start the connection process constantly. At first I thought it was my wifi not being a strong enough signal. But that was not the case. Then I thought it was my echo not staying connected but from other reviews you will see it is a defect with this product.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Update at 4 months out...,5.0 ,"I love these. I was concerned about them loosing connectivity, or just not working properly. I have now installed 7 of them throughout my house and, 4 months later, they are all working wonderfully. I have had zero problem with them. They can be a little finicky to install, but then they are golden. I would still highly recommend. I plan to update again in a few months. My original review from early December 2015 is below: I ordered one of these to operate my living room floor lamp. It took a small amount of time following the included instructions and following online advice from some reputable sources... after that it was a piece of cake. I have gotten two more to use Echo to turn on and off the Christmas tree, the floor lamp and now a table lamp... so cool! And the kids love it! The last one I had set up and in the system in mere minutes. The Wemo Switch is a great product. It has definitely enhanced our Amazon Echo... and no more trying to find the lamp switch in the dark... Now we just use a voice command to turn it on. I finally feel like we are living in the future. I also love that I can use them independently with the Echo without having to purchase a separate hub like most other products require. I did get one that I had to return because it came dead on arrival, but I think that was more an issue with the third party seller than the product, and Amazon promptly refunded my money so I could get a replacement. So far I am very pleased!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Wemo Works,4.0 ,"I have four of these in my house and let me just say, they work. The only issue I have is that I can't really find a whole lot of use for them when I'm not away on vacation. My house isn't huge, but am I really at a stage of laziness that I can't get up to turn a light switch versus sitting on the couch and doing it from an app. Thankfully no. The App has become better and better as time goes by which shows an active support from Belkin in making sure it doesn't become an antique. The Android App even has a widget toggle button now. What can sometimes be helpful is to set up static IP addresses for each plug so that if you lose power your router will find them more easily. It's also compatible with many voice control systems. Good product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Warning for Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note owners",3.0 ,"Warning for Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note owners - the WeMo Android app may not work on those devices for the initial set up. I bought the WeMo switch this week so I could remotely control a heat lamp for a rescue cat who recently adopted me. I am often away from home in winter and don't leave any heat on in my home, which the cat uses via a cat door. This switch sounded like a great idea and after reading about the incredibly easy setup I was anticipating getting this up and running in no time. After about 4 hours of incredibly frustrating trial and error trying to set this up, I finally threw in the towel and called Belkin support. The customer service rep had me repeat everything I had already done (which was basically just to follow the directions) but to no avail. Finally she asked me what kind of phone I was using, and when I said it was a Galaxy S4 she put me on hold for a few minutes, then came back on and asked if I could use a different phone. Huh? No, it's the only phone I own. She then told me there was an issue with the setup being run from an S4 and if I could find a different phone to do the setup with I then shouldn't have any problems using my S4 to operate it. So that night I borrowed my girlfriend's iPhone and ran the setup. It got past the point where my S4 had been failing (starting the app after connecting the WeMo WIFI signal did nothing but show me the setup instructions over and over again) but failed to activate the remote control. After a bunch more trial and error I found that I had to change my WIFI router settings. It didn't like WPA2 security with TKIP and AES, so I changed it to WPA2 with AES only, and it finally worked. I then tried operating it with my S4 and it worked fine. Now that it's finally set up, it works great. I have a Foscam IP camera in the room where the cat sleeps so I can log on remotely and see if he's there, then pan over to a thermometer to see how cold it's getting. If it's getting cold I turn on the heat lamp for him. It's great fun. This is a great little device that so far is working flawlessly, and if setup had been as easy as all the advertising said it was going to be, I'd be giving this 5 stars. But it was a royal pain in the a$# to set up mostly because Belkin failed to provide a decent set of instructions with an explanation of known setup issues and incompatibility with certain devices. Had they communicated those issues to me (I couldn't even find it in their FAQ or troubleshooting sections of the website) it would have saved me a lot of time and frustration. Hopefully they'll resolve this issue with a new version of the app.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Starting Smart,5.0 ,"I've been wanting to make my home smart, however I rent. I didn't want to invest in hardwired items (switches and plugs) that I would either leave behind or uninstall and replace everything. I wanted something easy to take with me. As I looked at different options, I found that almost all items needed a bridge. That's when I came across WeMo. I purchased a single switch for my bedroom light. I also purchased an Amazon echo dot. The WeMo came first and was easy to set up and using it alone was simple. I downloaded the app, plugged it in and turned my bedside light on and off from my phone. When I'm not home for a while, I turn it on/off to give the appearance someone is home. When echo arrived, it was also very simple to integrate the two. Now I can either tell Alexa to control it when I'm home and still have the remote ability as well. My only issue is the profile. It's a rather large so when you plug an item in, it will protrude out quite a bit so don't plan to push any furniture flush to the wall. It's a small sacrifice for the convenience. I'm looking forward to adding to my WeMo collection to increase my home automation. It delivers at a great price point, no need for a bridge and compatible with any smart phone and Echo. Definitely deserves consideration if you are stayingt home automation but don't/can't purchase expensive ""starter packs"". I would recommend to family & friends.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

It connected perfectly and still works today after 2 years of moderate use. I ordered another one and the plug will not connect to the app. This step has nothing to do with the router. It is a plug to app problem. In the end, I made the decision to return it. Controlling the outlet really isn't worth the hours it would take to troubleshoot. Replacement? I don't really need to control the outlet enough to take the chance of another dud. 3 stars is the average of a working unit and a non working unit.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
A Gadget That Turns Your Cell Phone Into a Remote Light Switch and More!,5.0 ,"As a security system, I purchased 3 of these devices because I wanted to be able to remotely turn 3 separate lamps on and off with a cell phone Application (App) when my family and I are not at home for one or more days. This switch comes with a Quick Installation Guide; however, it was over simplistic for my taste. Accordingly, here is how I installed the devices. 1. I plugged the lamp into an outlet and manually turned it on. 2. I plugged in the WeMo Switch to my wall outlet and plugged the lamp cord into the WeMo Switch. 3. I opened the Play Store App on my Samsung cell phone and typed in ""WeMo"" on the search engine, selected bekin's free App, downloaded it to my cell phone, installed it and moved the WeMo icon to my cell phone ""Home Page."" 4. I selected the ""Settings"" App on my cell phone turned off my ""Bluetooth"" setting and turned on my ""Wi-Fi"" setting. 5. I tapped the ""Wi-Fi"" icon again to view all available Wi-Fi networks and waited for my WAP (Wireless Access Point) to locate WeMo device software. 6. Still viewing my Wi-Fi ""Setting"" screen on my cell phone, I selected the ""WeMo Network."" 7. Next, I selected the WeMo Icon on my cell phone ""Homepage,"" and waited for it to notify me that the WeMo Switch was connected to my WAP and then selected the program option to save those installation setting 8. I followed the same procedure to install my other 2 WeMo devices to my WAP and cell phone and then selected the option to install the latest updates for the App. The WeMo App comes with a drop down menu list that includes: O Edit Device O Setup Instructions O Remote Access O Connect to IFTTT (If This Then That programming) O Tell Us What You Think! O Help Center O Settings & About. When you open the WeMo App there is an icon for each WeMo Switch and a place containing the name of each device that can be edited from the drop down menu at the top of the screen. To the right of the name of the device is an icon depicting an on/off button. Touch that icon and it becomes circled and highlighted in green indicating that the associated electrical device plugged into the WeMo Switch (my lamp) has been turned on. Touch it again and the button icon changes to gray and black indicating that you turned the lamp switch off. Currently listed at $39.99 each, these devices may seem a bit pricey; however, my remote use of them as a home security system makes them very cost effective over the long haul when compared to an alternative home security service Additionally, when it is dark outside it is very convenient to turn the lights on from a remote location and not have to stumble around turning lights on in an otherwise dark home.

The first day we received it he said it up immediately by plugging it into the outlet and then downloaded an application for his phone which helps you control it and sync it up to your Amazon Echo. Within minutes he had it up and running, however when Alexis searches for it even though it's listed as bedroom light you can't just tell Alexa to turn off the bedroom light, you have to tell her to turn off the quote unquote light.

Awesome... When it works!,4.0 ,"I use this in conjunction with Alexa. It works great, when it's working. I don't know whether to blame the Alexa app or the WeMo app. Every once in a while Alexa will say ""Sorry, I couldn't find a device or group named _______ in your account"". In the Alexa app it says ""offline"" for that particular device. However, I can still control it manually through the WeMo app which shows that it's still connected to my wifi. This makes me believe it's more of an Alexa issue but i'm no tech wiz. Trying to ""forget the device"" in the Alexa app and then trying to ""discover new devices"" does not work. After a period of time, usually the next day, Everything is working fine again.

I bought 2 more to use at different locations and could not set them up. When I called technical support for the product they advised that you could not control devices at different locations with the same IOS or Android App. Has something to do with the wifi setup they said. So you can control your WEMOs from anywhere it seems, but not when they are in multiple locations unless you control there with different cellphone or tablets for each location. A rather poor and unexpected product limitation I'd say. The 2 new ones I bought need to go back because of this.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
The future of home automation...are you kidding me,2.0 ,"Succeeded in connecting this plug switch to the wemo network, got to the point where the WiFi credentials are entered in the app, and down the hill from there. The app could never complete the setup due to loosing connection. Yet it looks like the switch itself might have acquired the setting because it would stop advertising its own wemo network. However, it could not be located on the network that it was getting connected to. Reset, repeat...same thing. Spent 30 minutes with Belkin's tech support to no avail. Was told it must be a hardware problem. Returning with no plans to replace. The Android app, by the way, is atrocious. Wrote a separate review on that in the play store.

Simple design and so many uses,5.0 ,"I bought this little guy almost three years ago when it was still ""cutting edge"". I paid a pretty penny for it and debated quite a bit as I wondered it it would really be worth while or if it was just an extravagant indulgence. :) These types of switches ARE an indulgence but I will say I've used this far more often than I would have expected and it's still going strong. I'm pleased I purchased it and am back to buy a few more. One of my favorite uses is the sunset timer. With a traditional timer plug you have to specify the exact hours it will turn on and off. With this I can set the time (via the app on my iPhone!) to auto adjust (you can use an offset too) based on the sunset. I've used this with decorative Christmas trees, lava lamps, fairy lights in lanterns, hard to reach switches, etc. I love that I can set up rules to turn it on and off and not have to worry about it. I've never had any problems with either the switch or the app, this is a well designed product and easy to use app.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Excellent,5.0 ,"I love these things. Have them about the house with various light fixtures. Have no problems. Been able to turn lights on/off from 2000 miles away. I know. I had a friend in the house to check. Only thing to drive you crazy is first use; there must be four plus downloads of upgrades to the devices and that takes time. Bit of an update. While on vacation I received a notice on my App that a firmware update was available. Now being over 1,000 miles from home I had a concern but did the download anyway. And to my surprise and gratification, all went off well. I had a friend stop by just to see if the lamps connected did go on/off and complete success. Some may have issues but these work well for me. I use an IPhone 5s with latest OS.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Firmware upgrade was needed immediately and hung for quite some time but eventually installed. There is an audible click when turning it on and off via wifi, which most likely has to do with the physical switch. Works well my amazon Echo, but is very slow. I have Lifx WiFi bulbs that turn on/off with < 1 second delay (usually not even noticeable).

Works great...now. Needs to be at a better price point and I will buy more. Need to better communicate firmware download status,4.0 ,"If a company could MFG and sell these things for $10-$15 a piece I believe they would sell tons more. While the convenience of this device is nice the actual value in comparison to the cost is not there. To friends and relatives you look lazy when you spend $30-$40 to get one of these. If it was $10-$15 you would look smart and they would want one as well. That being said. This device works great..... now. When I first purchased it I connected it to an outlet installed the app on my phone, connected from the phone to this switch and got it on my WiFi. Similar to setting up a Chrome Cast, but the similarities would end there. Once on my WiFi the app on my phone would find the switch and when I went to configure it the app told me that the firmware on the switch needed updated. That made sense to me as the switch had probably been on a shelf (due to price point) and many firmware versions had probably been released since it was originally programmed. So naturally you would tap the upgrade firmware button right??? I tried several times, however the button was grayed out as if something else needed to be completed before it could be tapped. So I looked for indication that something else needed to be done. I found nothing, not in the manual, not in the app. I did go online and found many others complaining about the same thing and lots who just sent it back. I decided to check the MFG page and see what I could find there. It took me some time, but I found an article that suggested that the switch itself that once connected to the WiFi would go out and download the firmware on its own, and that this could take some time. That seemed to fit the scenario that I was in so I decided to reset the switch to defaults and start again. This time when I got to the app notification about the firmware and I let the switch sit plugged in. I left it this way for several hours incase the download was large. I checked back and nothing still no update. I got frustrated uninstalled the app and intended to return the switch as defective. The switch stayed plugged in for about 3 days and I decided to give it one more shot. This time I installed the app on the phone, it found the switch and lo and behold the firmware update button was not grayed out. I tapped it the switch updated rebooted and has been working fine ever since. It seems the disconnect is communicating firmware/device status from the switch to the app. Had I known it was doing something I would have let it sit and attempted to update when the status indicated the firmware had downloaded. Being that there was no indication of download status I was left to believe nothing was happening.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Not So Easy to Set Up,3.0 ,"This is my first ""smart home"" device. The first time I set it up, it said that it failed to connect, and then after that the WeMo wireless network I was supposed to connect to in order to set it up was no longer available. I had to look up online how to reset the device. Then I went through the process again, and I got the same error message: WeMo has lost contact with your device. But then I went on and sure enough, it WAS connected after all. After that, the device worked perfectly. I then enabled the WeMo skill for Alexa, and linked the two together. That process went through without a hitch. I am now able to turn the lamp plugged into the switch on and off by speaking to my Spot. However, the ""instructions"" included with this device were laughably inadequate. I think perhaps the idea is to not give you much instructions as a way of suggesting that this thing is brain-dead easy to hook up. But it didn't work for me, and I had to go online to Belkin's website and search for the device, then search the FAQs in order to find out how to reset it and start over. There was no help available in the WeMo app on my iPhone either. I would have been a lot more impressed if there had been a page of instructions on how to set it up, along with a Troubleshooting link straight to the right page on their website to solve problems with it. Having to go to the Belkin website and search for the troubleshooting instructions was clunky. Most people might not bother. Why is it that so many things you buy today force you to do research on the Internet just to use them? What's wrong with written instructions? I will come back and update my review after a couple of weeks to see if the device stays connected. Meanwhile, based on this one experience, I would be inclined to look at other brands for my next smart device.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
they are awesome. When they don't,1.0 ,"Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. When they work, they are awesome. When they don't, ... no comments postable. I bought 5 of these for an elderly parent to enable her to safely turn lights on / off throughout her home. I bought 4 of these for myself to replace aging, non-working timers and to use as a morning alarm clock (wake to light rather than noise). For the first 6-9 months, life was lovely. However, recently that is not the way it is. In each home, some of the WeMo's work, some of them don't - and it's not always the same ones that work or not. Since it has been more than a year since some of these were purchased, returning them is not an option. At $50 a pop, I'm out about $450 plus hours and hours of time, plus additional $75 for wi-fi extender which did nothing to help the situation. I have done everything possible to try to get these back to a stable working condition, I have spent hours and hours and hours resetting the WeMo units, reinstalling the WeMo apps, making major changes to the wi-fi network (new SSID, new password,new frequency, etc.) - and yes that means all devices that use the wi-fi had to be reset to the new information. All to no avail. I've read through other reviews and the ""link"" provided by Belkin support leads to a page that is no longer in service. I have posted to the Belkin Cares twitter and Community forum. Belkin DOES NOT CARE. I suggest you purchase at your own risk.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Buyers rermorse, terrible product.",1.0 ,"WeMo switch periodically resets since I purchased on Jan 15th, 2015. I had the product for four months (now May 12th) and wish I hadn't purchased the product. The switch disconnects from router, even though router shows connected and I get the blinking orange light. The latest instance will not allow the wifi on my Android device to recognize the switch even though I can pick up one bar signals on about seven houses in the neighborhood. So know it is not the phone wifi. Let the switch plugged in for days, but no luck with the reset. Sometimes the switch will autocorrect itself. This is not one of them. I feel that the wifi on the switch has gone out. When it was working, it worked well as had the unit to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise. I have spent way too much time on this crappy product trying to get it to work since it was purchased. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Works sometimes, sometimes not",1.0 ,"I have three of these units. When they work they are great. They will work fine for several months, then a firmware upgrade happens and it'll be a struggle to get these units back online. One would not work at all and after hours with tech support, the agreed that it was bad. But I couldn't return them via tech support. I needed to call customer support. To date I have not been able to get through to customer support to get an RMA. I also have WeMo Insight Switch. It has also failed. So out of 4 units, 50% have stopped working. Terrible product. Terrible support. STAY AWAY! 5/1/14 - Contacted Wemo per the comment posted to this review and arranged for a replacement unit. When I asked about replacing my defective Insight Switch, I was told I needed to call Tech Support and have them first verify that the unit is bad. AFTER it's verified, then and only then will Belkin be willing to discuss sending out a replacement unit. Talked to the first level manager who could do nothing. They claim they aren't able to provide a technical evaluation of the item. That's fine, but they should change their name from customer service to shipping department, because they provide no service at all. Asked to speak with the manager's manager. To make a long story short, after 40 minutes on the phone with belkin, I finally have RMA numbers. I provided my CreditCard Info to guarantee return of the defective units and they are cross-shipping replacements for both units. So far, I've spend over 3 hours on the phone with Belkin tech support and customer service. 9/14/14 - It took several months for them to cross-ship my replacement units. Got them installed and they worked for a few weeks. But currently all 4 units are not visible on my iPhone. My original review stands. TERRIBLE PRODUCT, TERRIBLE SUPPORT. STAY AWAY. DO NOT USE IF THEY OFFER TO PAY YOU MONEY TO USE THEM.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Needs password protection from your kids,3.0 ,"I would love to give this 5 stars but the the app interface needs some work. PROS: This is an absolutely fabulous device. Plug it in, launch the app and it connects just like that. The app is easy to use. I've got it hooked up to my bedroom lamps and I can turn them off remotely or set timers for them. CONS: - it took my 16 year old son 30 seconds to download the app and connect to the WeMo outlet (see the PRO above). He then started turning my lamps on and off and on and off, and started to set on/off timers to turn my lamp on at 2 AM. There is no method in the app for authenticating who can control the outlet from the app to prevent kids from messing with you. There is a section in the app settings called ""Remote Access"" that lists my son's phone with an on/off toggle (making it look like I can bar his access) but toggling it off didn't do anything. Not to mention that the app installed on his phone had MY phone listed with an on/off toggle - making it look like he could bar my access. I realize that most people would want to leave password protection off so that a family could turn off household lights but I think it would be extremely helpful to make the user interface more secure.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Perfect replacement for lamp timers,5.0 ,"I have two of these that replaced lamp timers. In the iOS app you can set them up to turn on at sunset, then off at a specific time (e.g. 11:30PM). You can add another setting to turn on at a specific time (e.g, 5:00AM) and turn off at sunrise. So I have lamps set up to light up the house when it's dark outside. If you want it on outside of that time, you can use the app but I use my Echo Dot ""Alexa turn lamp on"". Pro tip: set up outlet per the app, then do ""Alexa discover devices"".","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
50/50 on this one,3.0 ,"This product works great when it works ... I was amazed on how cheap this product was. The ability to control electricity with a command of your voice. This reminded me of a time when the clapper was very popular. I had owned an amazon Echo for the longest time and all I really did with it was just listen to music, check the weather, or set my alarm clock. Never would I thought to control the lights in my room and games tv anything that required an outlet. This will require you to have WIFI in your house in order for WeMo to work. Now if you have a crappy wifi make sure you change it out and get an extender or a good access point were the WeMo has strong connectivity. Like I said it works well when it does. I replaced all of my access points I have very strong signal in all of my rooms and I still have issues with it working. Again I don't know if it is my house that is the issue, but I did spend well over few hundred dollars replacing everything in my house to get this to work and I think now its not me it maybe the WeMo. Right now its 50/50 for me.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
it can only be programmed to shut down automatically after a specified time period once it has been activated manually or by the,1.0 ,"I bought this device as it was supposed to be Echo compatible...my Echo cannot even locat it. Also, set-up instructions in the box are overly simplistic and not helpful for trouble shooting (e.g. resetting) the device. As near as I can tell, it can only be programmed to shut down automatically after a specified time period once it has been activated manually or by the Wemo app on your smart phone as vs. programming a start and stop time. I'll stick to my insteon devices.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Constantly disconnects from WIFI,2.0 ,"I've had this for four months and I am about done with it. Right after setup it works great but then eventually loses WIFI connectivity. After a reset it will never connect back to WIFI until I reboot my router and stand on one foot while whistling the theme to the Andy Griffith Show, and even then it takes about 17 tries. It works with Alexa right after a discovery and then stops working (granted this may be an Alexa issue, but I have other devices where this does not occur). The only real positive thing I can say about it is that even after it loses WIFI connectivity, it still sticks to the on/off schedule I had set during the nanosecond it was actually connected to WIFI.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Will not work. Not even the company could help me get them to work.,1.0 ,"I wouldn't recommend these. I have two and they worked at first but then I had to change the password on my router. They have never worked since. They will not take my new password. Not only have I spent hours trying to fix them I also have spent hours on the phone with their customer service. They went so far as to replace them and, again, they won't take the password. I have numerous devices including smart home switches, several Amazon echos, a smart TV, and many more and they all work. I even have two smart plugs of a different brand that work fine. There is something very wrong with their software and it seems they either can't fix it or won't. I wasted a lot of money on these things.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Cool toy,4.0 ,"I bought a couple of these switches. One is used to turn on a lamp in my living room at sundown, and off at bedtime. Works great, and I have it connected to my Amazon Echo so can use my voice to turn it on or off manually. The second one is in the kitchen, and I use it to turn on a mini-crockpot an hour before I get up so it will cook my oatmeal. That's great, except the wi-fi doesn't connect reliably where I want to use it (the signal is good for my phone, but the antenna in the WeMo switch isn't as good I guess). So I have the crock pot set up at a less desirable outlet. So if you are going to use these, consider how far they are from your router. They are great, but not infallible.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Great with IFTTT, but OEM app is clunky and difficult",4.0 ,"The lamp in my entry hallway is plugged into this unit, and I use two IFTTT recipes - one to turn it on at sunset, and one to turn it off at sunrise. I also set up an IFTTT recipe so I can turn the lamp on or off using my Google Home, for those dark days when you need the light on before sunset. The WeMo app for Android is clunky and difficult to use. Thankfully, after initial setup you don't need to use the app for automated tasks that can be handled by IFTTT.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"HAD TO CHANGE WIFI SETUP, NOT NEW PURCHASE!",4.0 ,"We had to reprogram our wifi on this plug, we bought it a few years ago, but Centurylink sent us a new modem/router and we had to change our wifi network. We had problems doing this even after following your instructions for changing this so we called your customer service: 3 times!! We could not understand them at all, they barely spoke English. And they could barely understand us or me just trying to spell my last name which really easy! You have got to get your customer service reps back in the states or at least teach them English. We had to hang up all 3 times, and we finally did it our selves, which brings me to this review, since you think I just bought this plug. When this plug works correctly it's great, when you have to talk to a customer service rep or even techs, your service sucks.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Straightforward installation and works as advertised - but not entirely happy with the app,4.0 ,"I bought this to replace a Orbivo switch which would work in the home on our network... but would not work when away from home on other networks.... I bought one in the US to operate a light there as a trial and it worked fine when at Home on our network and when on public networks. So, when we came back to the UK, I bought this and set it up. Set-up was relatively easy and it is working well.... except that in setting the app up on my phone... it searches for devices on your network, first of all, and wipes out access to other devices you may have on other networks! So I have lost access to the WeMo in the US which is disappointing. I had expected that once I had a dece connected to the app it would stay there. Anyway the device in the UK works well on all networks. I suppose that I can set up another WeMo account on a different device, maybe a tablet, when we get back to the US... but that complicates matters... My application? Well... my power company require monthly gas readings so I set up a cheap camera and light in the meter cupboard to turn on when a meter is required. I then note down the digits and turn off the light and camera. Time they had a remote way of reading the gas meter as they already do with the electric meter!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
because I have discovered that the WeMo switch does not work good with the rules,3.0 ,"I'm modifying my rating from 5 stars to 3, because I have discovered that the WeMo switch does not work good with the rules. I have worked with tech support and followed several of the posts on Belkin's support page and I can get one rule working but not both. Belkin support continues to ask you to jump through a 8 to 12 step reset process and then re-setup and reprogram the device to get it to work. That process did work for the first rule but the second rule still fails. Even if it worked, the fact that this is what is considered a normal procedure for any time you add a rule or make a change to your wireless router is insane!!! The device works great with Amazon Echo, but I'm hoping they fix the rules problems and WiFi changes problem ASAP. If not, I will be buying the TP-Link devices next. They have much better ratings.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great device controlling greenhouse lights.,5.0 ,"Easy to understand setup I just had a problem get it connected to my network. My iPad saw it fine but the network connect step with password entry never appeared. Moved closer to router and I breezed through setup and I was up and running quickly. The switch is actually located farther away and through a wall away from the spot my first setup failed to connect with the router. I have it controlling a grow light in the greenhouse. It comes on 30 minutes before sunset and then turns off later in the evening. Also if it is a real cloudy dark day I can turn the light on from wherever I am with my iPad or iPhone. It works fine with Amazon Echo. ""Alexa turn on the greenhouse lights"" "" Okay""! Now the test of time will be the final trial!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
But there are worse things in life,4.0 ,"WeMo Switch: It IS bulky so it DOES cover the other outlets. This is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. But there are worse things in life. And hey, I am able to turn stuff on and off remotely. Also, it is compatible with Echo/Alexa so overall I would recommend this product. WeMo Light Switch: It took me a while to install it because I needed to buy wire connectors. Or so I thought. Apparently, it comes with wire connectors so I hate myself for wasting time and money. The video instructions were VERY helpful. I installed it myself with no problem. It sucks though that I was able to install it only in the kitchen which has a neutral wire (required) but could not install it in the hallway because for some reason that location does not have a neutral wire. Too bad, that was my first location choice. Again, it is compatible with Echo/Alexa so overall I would recommend this product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I have several of these and was initially very pleased with them,2.0 ,"I have several of these and was initially very pleased with them. But, now they are becoming more and more unreliable. Do not connect to anything that you are depending on. They become non-functioning with the app indicating ""not detected"". If the switch is on when it goes out, it remains on and the manual button will not function - if they are off when they malfunction, they will remain off and the manual button will not function. I have sent problem reports to Belkin and hoping they will resolve these issues - but I am not optimistic. The idea is great but the execution is not there. Regardless of what is said, it has nothing to do with your wifi or the distance from your router. I have checked all aspects of this notion. PS: To get them up and running again just unplug from power source and plug back in. You do not have to factory reset them and go through the activation process all over again.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Good but not great,3.0 ,"Got this on sale but wished I would have waited for one of the mini's. Currently have 4 of the plugs and one switch. Overall I like the concept but the products could use some improvements to keep up with competition. Easy to set up and I like the app and the set up for the vacation mode for when we travel. Also like the capability of accessing via Alexa. Some of the draw backs are that the switches only work on a single plug and not a multi switch set up. Also would like to see the ability to use plugs on different networks but with the same app. Right now I can't use these in our vacation home unless I set them up on a different iOS device, can't use just one device for both locations.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Very nice switches to easily automate your home,4.0 ,"this the third one of these I have bought. I'm still an infant when it comes to the whole ""Connected Home"" thing, but I am happy with these Switches. They work really well. And they allowed me to automate a couple of lamps and a radiator. The lamps turn on when I wake up, and off 5 minutes after I leave for work. And the radiator turns on 1 hour before I wake up, to keep my bathroom toasty for when I jump in the shower. Setup is really easy through the Wemo app, and because they connect to your wifi, the can be controlled from anywhere from your phone, which is a big plus. And they do not need a hub to work, which is nice also. The Wemo app used to be buggy, but there have been several updates in the last year or so that have made the app much more stable. Which is nice. You can set up basic rules, like on-off at a given time or day of the week, and you can also create rules with IFTTT, although their effectiveness is somewhat hit-and-miss (I had a rule to turn on my lights at dusk, but after a while they either came on way too early, or late enough that I was already too dark in my home to see comfortably). Another minor annoyance is how big those things are. I have seen some new smart switches announced in CES, that essentially should do the same thing, and they are easily half the size, which means they don't stand out as much. Big and bulky is not something I like in my technology, at least not in tech like this, which is supposed to work behind the scenes, so to speak, and not be obvious or apparent that you even have it. On the plus side of IFTTT, Wemo Switches are now compatible with a whole host of other connected devices, such as the Nest Thermostat. So that you can create rules, that, for example, allow you to turn on or off lights and at the same time rise or lower the temperature in your home, based on certain parameters you set. This is very cool, but in my opinion it is still in its infancy. IFTTT rules are often not very flexible, and I hope that in the future they'll become a lot more useful and flexible. All in all, I really like these switches. I will like them even more if they can make them smaller, and if there is better results when using IFTTT rules.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great device - will buy more.,5.0 ,"This device is great. I don't understand why it gets the bad rep here on Amazon. If your network is configured properly, you patiently set up the device, and you don't stick this on something that's a mile away from your router - you'll be fine. I use this for my window air conditioner as I unfortunately do not have a home with central air. I can turn my air conditioner on an hour or so before I get home and my place is pleasantly cool when I arrive. Going to purchase 1 or 2 more to set up something similar. I haven't experienced any issues, and setup was easy. Plug it in, get the app on your device, and when you run through the setup and are connected for the first time, it'll ask you to update the firmware. It has to go through i believe 3 sets of firmware to be fully up to date. It loads the firmware, reboots, and then when you reopen then app on your phone/device it'll find another one. This took about 10-15 minutes with me just sitting on my couch as it updated. It's easy! I've also seen some complaints that there's a lag with turning it on via the app to when the switch kicks on. There is a 2-3 second lag when you are connected via your mobile carrier, which is understandable. There is a 0 second lag when you are hooked up to your home wi-fi on the same network these are on. So not sure what the issue is there... some people might just be nit-picking.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Be prepared for a wrestling match during initial setup,3.0 ,"If you are one of the lucky ones, this will work out of the box for you. However, if you are like what seems like 99% of the population, getting this to work for the first time will be a nightmare. It took me over an hour and I'm VERY tech savvy being a software engineer who wired his entire home 1gbps home network. My only suggestion is to make sure you do the initial configuration in the same room as your router!!! Once you have it on your network and connected to your phone and once you can use your phone to turn it on and off, then take the time to upgrade the firmware before you move it to your desired destination outlet. One more thing, these devices do not seem to do well in those low-signal wi-fi spots in your home that are farthest from your router.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Can be difficult to set up,3.0 ,"I have 6 WeMo's. When they work, they work well. They are not 100% locked in and in that you are at the mercy of any switch being grayed out till it becomes recognized again. This can take a bit. They are difficult to set up if you have more than one wifi in use. I have a wifi repeater using the same password 100 foot away from my house and this is where my solid connection problems are. The app has recently been updated and I noticed a few improvements but they need to get on with even better firmware. Belkin needs to attach a login port so you can set up use with more than one tablet or smart phone. I'm scared to try to use it that way for fear I will make all of the switches drop off. Resetting the switch to make new settings is cumbersome. It involves unplugging the switch and then re-plugging it while holding the top button. A little more than a one hand operation. Let go of the button when the light turns solid orange and wait for the light to flash blue/orange. Then search for the switch in your wifi with your phone or tablet. The process is time consuming and does not assure success so the process has to be repeated till you see it show up in the app. As you can see I have done this many times. The more switches you have, the more difficult they are to install as you add to the app. Nice concept but still has bugs to be worked out. Belkin, if you are reading this, get on with the firmware upgrades and a website with login would be a nice improvement. Thanks for upgrading the app a little ... please don't stop with the upgrades. Note: I had some issues setting these up. I finally decided to uninstall the app on my iphone and start over. That was a big plus. Be sure to install the firmware and wait to install all of your switches before you try the setting up rules for them. I have been able to use them away from home. They function over 3-4g networks but work better over wifi.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It works!,2.0 ,"-- UPDATE -- After two months it has stopped working. Took support 3 full days to help me and they were slow. Even though I told them I did all the steps, they took a day to come back with all the steps and asked me to do them again. Then I get to Level 2 and they start over with the same results. I am getting a replacement, but I have to pay to ship the unit back and I will be down at least 1 - 2 weeks (day 4 already and I am just shipping the unit back). Not acceptable. I have another unit on order from another manufacture and this will most likely be the last Belkin items I purchase. --END OF UPDATE -- -------------------- Works perfect with Home-Assistant.

Works Well,4.0 ,"I have 2 of these and one of their switches. All 3 are connected to an Amazon Echo Dot. Setting this device up is extremely easy. Downloading and installing the app probably took longer. Just have the WeMo app ready, plug the device in and connect to the device's wifi through the app. You then have it connect to your home wifi, through the app and you're done. You can control the device at home, or remotely, with the app. You can also schedule times for it to go on/off. To connect to the dot was even easier. You can do it through the Alexa app (smart devices) or just ask for it to search for smart devices.

Rocky start but seems to be working reliably,5.0 ,"So, setting this up turned out to be a bit of a hassle for me. An hour and a half of waiting for a firmware update resulted in a midnight call to Belkin. But the matter was resolved promptly and professionally and I even recieved a follow up call today to make sure it was still working. So customer service is top notch. The switch seems to work reliably. I'm intending on using this one for for Christmas lights during the holidays (I currently have candy corn lights plugged into it) and it works reliably and quickly. Using it with an Amazon Echo works well too, though there is a it of a lag at times (more so than with other smart home devices I have) but it's barely noticeable.

Good product,4.0 ,"This was my first purchase from Belkin. I always thought Belkin products were the most expensive ones on the shelf, which is why I always avoided buying Belkin products. I bought this only because it was one of the cheapest product in its class. I liked the product I must say. I am actually surprised by the amount of -ve feebback this product has. My installation was very straight-forward. It wasn't quick, but very straight-forward. Considering the amount of activity on the device while installation, it wasn't supposed to be quick. Bottom-line is - Follow Instructions.... It was a interactive installation (don't expect it to be seamless). And that is how it should be, The device after all is accessing your local area network. Once installation was complete, the reaction time of on-off action from my cell phone app to the device was amazing. I was actually surprised by how quick the device response time was. Both from iPhone/Android, from local area network or from another WiFI network, from 3G or 4G.... it worked without a glitch. Looks are good too. My only beef is (which is why 4 star) is - This device can also act as a hub for wifi enabled bulbs. Belkin should promote that. This may be intentional by Belkin to sell their hub (which is no state of the art compared to Wink or SmartThings) I discovered that after a lot of digging. Dont expect this switch to be a magical hub. It will be with least abilities. Now, if I just want a couple of wifi bulbs and a power switch in my household, I can do that within 100 bucks. Pros: * In its class, it is the cheapest device * Response time thru LAN, Non LAN, 3G or 4G is brilliant * Looks nice Cons: * Installation took some time, not seamless (which I guess is justified). You have to be careful in each and every step. * is also a hub but the fact is not promoted","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Pesky Device,2.0 ,"This device and APP needs some work. Here are my comments: 1) Seems pricey for an electrical switch, but I wanted a piece of electronics that my Amazon Echo can talk to. (It can). 2) If I lose power or unplug it, it needs to be set up all over again. It is not obvious how to reset this thing, even though it has a restore button. There is really no user manual so I can't tell what the blinking lights, blue or amber mean. Finally found a web page that tells me how to reset. 3) When the device is offline and you open up the APP, it will ask you what device you are setting up, and gives you several WEMO product options, (e.g. setting up a light switch, crockpot, etc..) EXCEPT this one product...how dumb. 4) My APP tells me to download the newest version of Firmware, but it never works. It tries for about 30 minutes and then basically destroys any connection you have had, which brings you back to the beginning, which brings you back to my 2nd comment. Very frustrating. Customer support told me wait a ""few days"". As long as it is working, I don't think I'll do anything with Firmware unless they send me an email. No case number, nothing. Just try again in a few days.....no thank you. 5) I am pretty experienced with computer technology, but I have spent way too much time on this for such a simple plug. If I can't set up and maintain simple plug, please have my head examined for thinking about purchasing the more complicated products, like a light switch. 6) I expected much better from this company....I do like Belkin. 7) On the positive my Amazon Echo can find this device, and I can turn off the lamp with my voice....my goodness...I love technology but I guess I am so lazy that I will spend this much money on a plug switch!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Great when they worked, not so much when they fail",1.0 ,"The WEMO switch is great when it works, but after a few months each one of them becomes unable to connect to the home network. I really enjoyed being able to turn off lights from bed ... and to be able to turn on/off Christmas tree lights without crawling under the pine needles, to operate lights remotely, illuminating my home as I return home in the evening rather than entering a dark house. Perhaps the app updates don't support the prior generation equipment? I don't know why I am unable to restore my 4 WEMO switches to operating order, but the technology is not so sophisticated that it should be so unreliable. I'll be looking for a more reliable replacement for remote control of a few key lights in my home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works exactly as expected but pricey,4.0 ,"If you're dabbling in home automation this is a great start. The Belkin app works well and you can switch it on or off anywhere you have internet access. Even better, if you're even reasonably technically inclined check out the app IFTTT (IF This Than That) on your smartphone which will let you toggle the switch based on things like e-mail received, temperature, stock prices, your location, etc. I have mine turn on a lamp in my front window when I enter my neighborhood since we don't have street lights and the house is hard to find. I deducted one star because the smartphone app should do that itself and because the unit is pricey. Sure comparable units are comparably priced but that's no excuse, Belkin. I've come to rely on you for quality electronics at good prices so knock off a few bucks and start taking over the home automation space!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Not ready for prime time, but...",3.0 ,"I wanted to give this one star due to Wemo's very buggy software, but decided that wouldn't be fair because the switch does its job if you are willing to grapple with the bugs and don't try to get too fancy in your home setup. But the bottom line is that for many people this product is just not ready for prime time. If you want a home automation device that you can plug in, set up easily, and forget about while it functions reliably day after day, look elsewhere. When it's working, the Wemo offers a lot of ways to control anything that can be plugged in to an electrical outlet. I was particularly interested in having lights come on around sunset and wanted smart logic that could change that time to follow the seasons. But there are a lot of hidden gotchas. Daylight Saving time sent it into terminal confusion. Lights would turn off/on randomly. The device would drop out of my network or become invisible in the Wemo app. Wemo support keeps saying reset, reboot, re-install. Every day? Come on. But, to be fair, after a fair amount of tinkering and some firmware improvements, my switches seem to be working more often than not. Before you buy, go to the Wemo community forums and read about all the problems and limitations so that you can determine whether they apply to your setup and whether you would be willing to put up with a bit of tinkering to work around them.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Using Alexa to control my lights, awesome!",5.0 ,"Bought five of these to control table lamps in a few places through the house... frankly, I was sick of having to walk around to all of our lights at night to turn them off, then stumble around in the dark on my way up the stairs. I specifically used these with the intention of controlling them via Alexa, and it worked flawlessly. I created one group for the basement (two lights) and one for the living room (three lights). The WeMo Android app works really easily too to turn them on/off. Only thing I've noticed is that maybe once a month, one of them will randomly disconnect from wifi, and I have to reset it (just unplug/plug back in). Not a big deal.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Terrible Product,1.0 ,"I have a reasonable amount of technical expertise, having built computers and done some programming, as well as having installed my wireless network and a Sonos system. The Wemo system proved uninstallable. The idea is good and the software, when not crashing, is easy to use. However, I have been unable to use the Wemo Switch. I initially had some trouble configuring the switches (I tried three to make sure I didn't have a defective product) and a little difficulty upgrading the firmware. After I got the switches updated and configured, near my router, I moved them to their permanent locations. That's when the trouble started: All switches could no longer be found by the Wemo app on my iPhone 5. I had to reconfigure them to get them back, but unplugging and replugging them in the same outlet near the router, also caused them to no longer be recognized. Trying to configure a switch in my living room and family room at the other end of the house resulted in failure as the Wemo could not pick up my wireless network. I have an extender for that part of the house and all my devices work fine there. I'm returning the switches, as even the ones that work close to the router are only good until the first power failure.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Best way to dip-your-toes into home automation!,5.0 ,"I connected three of these Switch Smart Plugs to various lights/lamps throughout my house. Using the WeMo app was easy enough, but the real ""power"" of these switches comes from their integration with Google Home. I connected the switches to my Google Home (using IFTTT, since they haven't released native support just yet), and now I can control all of my lights without moving from my couch! There's the occasional 3-5 second lag between my command ending and the light switching on, but it's never long enough, where you'd question it being worth the money. My ONE ""con"", which isn't bad enough to take away a star, would be that the switches themselves make an audible ""click"" when toggled. So, from across the room, you can hear the plug switch-on and off. All in all, these switches are a great value for anyone entering into the realm of home automation.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works great with Amazon Echo and home automation,5.0 ,"UPDATE 5/27/15 I realized the internet connection issues were with the switch distance from the Wi-Fi router. These switches need to be fairly close range to the router getting a very good signal so to stay Wi-Fi connected. When they are, the phone app works very well controlling the switches. If installing in areas where other Wi-Fi devices show 3 bars or less, you will have Wi-Fi issues with the switch. Switch needs a really strong Wi-Fi signal to stay connected. PS. If you install these switches, and find the phone app does not find the switch AFTER installed went ok, you need to cycle (power off-on) your router. That seems to allow the switches to all successfully connect to your Wi-Fi. =============================================================== Works really good with the Amazon Echo and home automation. Stays online, with the Echo, for reliable switch control. I found when only using with the Belkin phone WEMO app, not a good an experience. But using the Amazon ECHO with this switch is reliable and slick because both the ECHO and the SWITCH are always home network WiFi connected, so both talk to each other and never seem to ever lose communication. Using with ECHO, great! But when using with the phone app (iPhone/Android), not so good.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"When it (finally) works, it works great.....",3.0 ,"Bought 2 of these, thinking great idea! They were all very easy to set using the WEMO network, although it constantly showed as ""not in range"" when I wanted to start over. It connected fine to my home network, but I had some issues getting the application to work - it just willy-nilly chooses not to find a unit, even though it had just 15 minutes before. During initial set-up, it took 50 minutes to find the 2nd unit. I'd recommend setting up multiple units all at once, rather than one at a time like I did. Right now, they are both working, but now it is asking to do a firmware update. I want to, but am worried that they won't work after that. We'll see. I'll modify my review after the update. For the timer I set up a light in my living room. It comes on at night and in the morning just like any other light. For the light switches, I set one up on the fountain out front. When it gets really windy the water level drops as the wind blows. I could now turn it off remotely using the IPhone application. The last switch I put in the garage to run a flood light. The garage is detached and the switch is in the garage. The light was worthless because I'd have to go outside to the garage to turn it on at night. Not the case now. I set up a schedule on my porch light to turn off at sun rise with no events to ever turn it on. That allows me to turn it off anytime I want on demand and have it automatically turn off at sunrise. It works well...when it works. For the most part everything worked well. The problems I have is the iPhone app is ""clunky"". If I don't wait for the app to refresh itself, I will lose control of my devices (that seems to be the case). When this happens there is no recovery unless I unplug the timer and trip the breaker for the switches. No other known way to reset these. All three devices routinely fall off the network on their own. When this happens the schedules appear to still work (hard to confirm because they are all over night schedules). There is nothing I can do but switch the breakers off and on to get them back. They do not recover on their own.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

This so far is the only one that I have purchased that actually delivered. The biggest reason for purchasing these was to control the amount of time the kids spend playing with their electronic devices. They are installed in a home automation cabinet.

"A lot of set up hassle before it works, then it's unreliable even once set up.",2.0 ,"UPDATE (1 year owned): Dropped the rating from 3 to 2 stars. These plugs are entirely unreliable, dropping in and out of the network constantly. I've even assigned permanent IP addresses to these plugs, and they are still unreliable. They will literally disappear from the app (and from the network) at completely random. The router drivers are all up to date, and all other items on the network are 100% reliable. When you get it set up, it works great. But it is an unholy pain to setup. Especially if you change your router settings. There is a lot of resetting, unplugging and plugging back in, downloading and deleting and re-downloading the app. It's so frustrating that I have one I haven't bothered reseting since changing my router password two months ago.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

The rating of 3 is due to the frustrating experience of trying to get it connected to my network. This was easily the most difficult installation that I've ever encountered, and it didn't have to be. The installation instructions are vague, incomplete, and out of date. They certainly don't match current Android 5.1 setups. And, the beginning of the ""setup"" is actually a preview of the installation process (although, you might not know that until you've come irritated by the unresponsiveness of the screens. I'm not going into the details of my trial and error process, There is quite a bit of self congratulatory ""help"" on the Belkin web site, but much is sadly out of date. It's even out of date for the connection to Echo. I wouldn't recommend against purchasing this device, but be prepared to be annoyed. This is from an EE with 50 years of experience. That said, I will buy another provided this unit stays connected for a couple weeks. Now to UPDATE my experience after just over one month. The device is no longer connected to my network ... it apparently decided to seceed from my system. After an hour of fussing it still is not connected. And, echo cannot find it either. I would not recommend this device to anyone. Connecting and maintaining a network connection seems to be hit and miss. Connecting a device to a network should not require any effort if you know the network passwords. Echo has certainly proved that. DO NOT BUY this. There must be some alternative device that actually works.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Good luck connecting the WeMo to your home WiFi,1.0 ,The product doesn't work properly. For the first day it performed as expected and then began failing. I worked with it for two days and it finally came down to the WeMo WiFi wouldn't connect to my in-home WiFi because it wouldn't accept the valid password for my in-home WiFi and therefore was useless. I have many connections to my WiFi all using the same password that WeMo refused to validate. I then went on an extended Web research reading evaluations and alas there were others that had exactly the same experience.

Initially could not get to work with my Android phone ...,3.0 ,"Initially could not get to work with my Android phone. Finally installed the Wemo app on my Android tablet that doesn't have cellular, just WIFI. This time it worked. Renamed it to something Echo Alexa could understand, and now I can voice control it with Alexa. The Android app really freaks out if you try to connect with a phone which has cellular service. I think this is because you have to put the Wemo device first in your WiFi pecking order, which causes you phone to switch to cellular from Wifi, which totally doesn't work with setup. So hopefully you have something that only uses Wifi. Once it was setup on my wifi tablet, the wemo app on my phone had it too.

Of all my Wi-Fi devices connected to Alexa those ones are the only giving me a hard time. They lose the connection at least once a month ( both in within 10 feet away from the router), sometimes they respond very slow, pairing them back is a pain. Considering both of them act the same I'd say it's not a device malfunction but rather a faulty design. Bottom line, if you use them for a critical job (ex. on an automated home control security function) they are not reliable. You will enjoy turning on and off a desk lamp, though. Can't say how other brands perform but definitely next time I'll try something else.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I love it! It's much more reliable than the Ankuoo NEO Wi-Fi Smart Switch!,5.0 ,"First, I bought an Ankuoo NEO Wi-Fi Smart Switch. I installed it on my air conditioner (a window unit). Sometimes it worked, but often I'd come home to find it hadn't turned on the air conditioner when it was supposed to. After a while, I finally gave up on it and returned it to Amazon.

The app would crash and often I wasn't able to access the device remotely using the app to make sure it was on or to turn it on manually. This time I did my research. I looked for a device that stores the programming on the actual device so it will turn on as programmed. Not only does my air conditioner always turn on as it should, the app always works remotely, whether my phone is connected to wifi or not.

Perfect for rented dwellings.,3.0 ,"I purchased this device for Amazon Dot. Using my voice to control the switch and having the app control the switch from outside of my apartment is great! This device does not have to be permanent wired into the electrical system, which is perfect for rented dwellings! So far the until and app have worked perfectly. I had to come back and submit an update for this product. Over the past six months it responds to commands only once, only a quarter of the time. Often times the command to turn on or off has to be sent twice. The unit is closer to the hub than any of the newer units, so there should be no issues. If you could bypass this unit and get the updated version, that would work better for you. I also have the newer units, and they have responded perfectly every time so far.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"I would NOT say this is an easy setup, maybe if you are just setting it ...",2.0 ,"I would NOT say this is an easy setup, maybe if you are just setting it up with WEMO App, but not if you are setting up with the Amazon Echo. Lots of steps back and forth. I would rate the setup of my first WEMO switch a 3.5, but the 2nd WEMO switch was a nightmare, difficult, sometimes it would be recognized on the wifi network other times not. And when a firmware update was required, it wouldn't be recognized at all after that. Multiple support calls, it looks like this 2nd WEMO switch is a failure and will have to be sent in for replacement. Fortunately it is still under warranty with WEMO, but not available for return from Amazon at this point.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Neat idea but it needs work,2.0 ,"We purchased this to use as a controllable timer for a light when travelling. Originally I was pleased with the setup and operation, as we could set different schedules and turn the light on/off remotely, even though it is a fairly bulky plug that sticks out from the wall outlet. We have another Wemo device so I was trying to stay consistent and only use one app for lighting. However, since then it has disconnected multiple times, the app will not recognize the device, and you cannot reconnect to the switch's wifi to set it up again. The first time it had to be powered on/off several times and eventually it came back to life, but that's useless if you're not there to do that (that's the point of a remote timer!). I have sent the ""troubleshooting"" email from the app, but never received a response from Wemo. Probably won't buy more of their products because of the intermittent service.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love it! Found a great way to NOT BLOCK the bottom outlet!,5.0 ,"I have 5 WeMo switches now and they all have worked perfectly. At first, I was upset that when in use, it covered the bottom outlet due to it's size. I bought a 6 prong outlet (2 outlets in front and 2 outlets on each side) and it works very well. I can hook up the WeMo switch at the top and still have the bottom outlet free...plus I gain 4 extra outlets. So, don't let the size of it discourage you from purchasing. The 6 prong outlet sells here on Amazon for under $6 as an Add-on item.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Alexa seems to understand and control these switches better than anything else. we di not want a wall o rcountertop switch for our disposal when remodeled so we had the electrician wire a switched outlet into the cabinet under the sink. that meant we had to open the cabinet to turn the disposal on and off. i put a WEMO switch in that outlet and plugged the disposal into the WEMO.now,with our Echo sitting on the kitchen island, we can imply say, ""Alexa turn on disposal"" and vice versa no more wet hands on the cabinet door!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Disappointing out of box experience. No support for complex wifi passwords.,1.0 ,"It's a nonstarter for me since you cannot connect the device to a network with symbols in the password. What a waste of time. I don't think making my password less secure and having to change every device in my house is worth the benefit of having this device. Another great example of lazy security for 'the internet of things'. My 10 year old timer will have to keep turning on my espresso machine for me. Really disappointed. If they were lazy about this I can only imagine the rest of the product is a disappointment as well. From their support website: ""WeMo supports WPA2 passwords of eight (8) to 63 characters comprised of letters and numbers only. WeMo will fail to connect to your network if your wireless password contains any spaces or symbols in it.""","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
but I'm sure the design will only get better and better,5.0 ,"These switches are big, a little clunky, but I'm sure the design will only get better and better. For now, however, this product does the intended job. You have to download the app on your phone, tablet or computer and the name it in the app. We use this particular plug for our Christmas lights. We also have Alexa to control the switch, so we say, ""Alexa, turn on the Christmas lights,"" and walla, they turn on. Syncing the switch with Alexa was easy once the Wemo app was installed on my phone. After Christmas, we will use the switch for something else, so I will change the name of the switch, that way we are not asking Alexa to 'turn on the Christmas lights' and my diffuser turns on.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works Well When It Works,3.0 ,"I bought three of these things with high hopes. Previously I was using the manual timers with the little tabs. I was already resetting them with the changing sunset and DST. I bought this product because of the sunset rules that they have. I thought it would be nice to not have to manually update the times throughout the year. I purchased one outlet timer from Amazon and followed up a few days later with a two pack of light switches from Sams. They were all very easy to set up on the network. I had a few struggles getting the iPhone application to work, and setting up my own icons for each device. I hobbled through it. No issues there. For the timer I set up a light in my living room. It comes on at night and in the morning just like any other light. For the light switches, I set one up on the fountain out front. When it gets really windy the water level drops as the wind blows. I could now turn it off remotely using the IPhone application. The last switch I put in the garage to run a flood light. The garage is detached and the switch is in the garage. The light was worthless because I'd have to go outside to the garage to turn it on at night. Not the case now. I set up a schedule on my porch light to turn off at sun rise with no events to ever turn it on. That allows me to turn it off anytime I want on demand and have it automatically turn off at sunrise. It works well...when it works. For the most part everything worked well. The problems I have is the iPhone app is ""clunky"". If I don't wait for the app to refresh itself, I will lose control of my devices (that seems to be the case). When this happens there is no recovery unless I unplug the timer and trip the breaker for the switches. No other known way to reset these. All three devices routinely fall off the network on their own. When this happens the schedules appear to still work (hard to confirm because they are all over night schedules). There is nothing I can do but switch the breakers off and on to get them back. They do not recover on their own. My router is less than a year old. Other applications (such as the Honeywell thermostat) all work fine with no issues. Last night I updated the app on iPhone and now today I have no control over my devices again. On some occasions, I would try to turn on a device using the application while in the same area and the app would tell me the device is on and it would not be on. Sometimes I would push it again and the device would then come on after a second attempt even though the button was already green on my application. I believe conceptually these are nice, however, I believe we have some bugs in the software that really need to be addressed soon. At the very least the devices should be smart enough to connect back to the router automatically (or whatever the problem is with these things). Unfortunately, I cannot count on these devices to function if had to depend on them while out of town. I've also played with the ""If This Then That"" network and that works well with WEMO devices. For now, I will not be investing in any more WEMO devices until some sort of fix is released. I'll hobble along with what I have as they do have some function (just not what I paid for). I'm also concerned about how useful these devices would be if Belkin decided to abandon their internet framework.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Perfect for Echo.,4.0 ,"I struggled for a few minutes at first trying to get the app to connect to the plug, but I just kept trying and on the third try or so it connected and I was able to get it all set up including setting schedules. The Alexa app was able to discover the plug right away and I've never had an issue controlling the plugs (ended up buying another because I was so satisfied with the first) through the Echo. I'm going to buy two more of them to control various lights around my apartment.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Belkin/WeMo Customer Support is woefully lacking (especially compared to others) when problems arise, no phone support!!!",1.0 ,"This is not specific to this WeMo switch as much as it is a commentary on the Belkin Wemo Support for the whole environment which is severely lacking. Their devices have worked well right out of the box and with Alexa, but when something fails down the road, my experience is that their support process sucks. I co-own a cell phone and computer repair and home automation business and use my home as a test bed to recommend different solutions to customers. For WeMo, in the beginning, I ordered the WeMo hub with a couple of smart plugs, later expanded system to 4 Wemo bulbs, 3 smart plugs and 4 light switches. The Wemo hub failed after around 6 or so months, it will not establish connections with my devices. The smart plugs and light switches still work with Alexa (as they are accessed directly via WiFi), the bulbs don't as they use RF and need the hub to translate. So the bulbs are useless without the hub and the switches can't be put on a schedule without hub (which was a significant reason to order them, to activate lights when out of town). The only way I found Belkin to offer ""support"" for these Wemo devices is via email, NO live phone interaction. In my case, the issue is clearly a defective hub (been doing home automation for many years so this issue is not rocket science), and the email interaction offered is a rudimentary Level 1 support dialog scripts (that I already tried before I reached out to them). My very simple request was for them to verify the defect and then send me a warranty exchange. They were unable to put this into motion, so I requested several times a phone call back to talk to someone for 5 minutes to resolve. After a month since the latest ask, I have yet to receive a call (and at this point don't expect one). So the hub just sits there reminding me of their lack of phone support and inability to do simple warranty exchange. So, save yourself a lot of frustration when a problem arises and order a different manufacturers switch/plug. My experience with other vendors, like TP-Link, which have live customer support and functionally identical units, are they are competent and have always resolved issues quickly and to my satisfaction. One specific similar example was a warranty issue with a smart TP-Link motion detector that happened a couple of weeks after the Wemo hub failure. TP-Link resolved it quickly. I reached their live phone support and after walking through the diagnostics with their support person on the line, they determined it was a defective unit, cross shipped a replacement and I was back up an running in less than 4 days. Contrast this with Belkin/Wemo which still unresolved almost 2 months later...","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
WeMo,2.0 ,"Works, but tends to disappear from my Echo intermittently. Update: 12/16/16... When this device works, it's really great. The problem is that the switch is only intermittently available on the Echo and the WEMO app. It's really great to turn the garage or exterior lights on using your phone when you are coming home. However, the app is only available about half the time. Setup was also very difficult, and I was only able to finally complete setup with information I found on the internet. I like the features of the switch, but I think the manufacturer has a ton of work to do to get this right. The plug in WEMO switches, although difficult to set up, keep working all the time. I'd buy more of these if they worked better.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Now the software was very crappy. wi-fi connection gets disconnected every once in a ...,1.0 ,"I own two of the ""light switches"" and two of the ""switches."" They are some very poorly designed products and software. The light switches can not be used as a anything but a single switch. If you have a two way or even a three way switch configuration, it doesn't work. The switches are a bit bulky so you can't really plug in a large plug into the other outlet. Now the software was very crappy. wi-fi connection gets disconnected every once in a while so you end up not seeing the controls. The switches are very bad with the wi-fi connections. Their support for android is very lacking. I posted in their forums about the status of Android 5 support a few weeks before the actual release of Android 5, there was no response until about 3 weeks after Android 5 release for them to say that it will be ready soon. Other wemo developers had their app working for the Android 5 release but not Belkin. It's their own product and they don't have a release that works. It's not like android 5 previews were not available to the public since the previews were available for months before the final release. Totally lacking support for Android. Maybe better on iphone but since I don't use iphone, it's useless to me. The rules don't work too well and very limited. There is no option of just having it run for X amount of time and then shut off. Did I mention how bad the wi-fi connections are. The switches are about maximum 3 feet away from my AC dual band router and it still has wi-fi connection problems. My advice, find some other product for home automation. These devices are not reliable. update 6/9/2015 Just installed the app on the Asus Zenfone 2 and the app crashes. It's Android 5.0 so I don't see where the problem is. The level of incompetence from Belkin for Android support is just staggering.

Great device for use with cell phones or with Amazon Echo.,5.0 ,"Bought this to use with my new Amazon Echo. It works great, both with the Echo and with our iPhone and Android phone apps. It was easy to set up. When traveling, it allows us to pre-program times when our lights will turn on and off. But unlike the timers we've used for years, which were limited to just turning things on and off at the same time every day, the Wemo Switch Smart Plug allows us to also turn the lights on and off with our cell phones from anywhere in the world whenever we want. You do need to make sure you give each switch a unique name that is simple and that you will remember if you're going to use it with the Echo, or the Echo won't recognize what you want to do.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great device if not a a little chunky and clumsy,4.0 ,"Wanted to try the Wemo recipes in Echo so took the dive - so far it's been neat, but a bit underwhelming. We have a home full of Philips Hue and IoT tech so this device has been a little disappointing. We have used our WeMo outlet as a way to smarten up a Christmas tree and have now swapped it to a lamp we want to keep an Edison bulb in rather than add an ugly Hue bulb. I do recommend this product but I wish I had waited to get the smaller new version as this one takes up a full set of two outlets. Not a deal breaker just kinda irritating. If you like smart home stuff and have an echo this is great - just maybe spend a bit more and go for the smaller version.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
A Disappointingly Good Idea,2.0 ,"The two units I purchased have been a disappointment - rarely do they stay connected to the Echo for more than a day. They will operate via the WeMo app (most of the time) but that is no more convenient than the X10 switches these were to replace. The switches attached to devices which are difficult to reach, so the need is more than that of just a tech toy. I say the WeMo is available via the app but they are fickle, sometimes failing and having to be reset. I cannot see how it is the Echo as the Harmony television remote capacity works fine on the Echo as do the other devices on the network. The manufacturer was dismissive when reached asked for assistance; funny how they embed a simple contact form in the app itself which then results in a non-response.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Makes Amazon Echo Way Cooler,5.0 ,"This works great with the Amazon Echo. I have it connected to a small heater under my office desk. I named the WeMo Switch ""Heater"" and ""Heat"" (You can come up with more than one name for the same device.), so no if I say ""Alexa turn on heater"", or ""Alexa, Heat."", my feet get a nice hot breeze from my heater. You could connect this to a wide variety of devices, but I would not recommend this for lights. If you want to control lights, it would make more sense to buy smart lights, such as the Philips Hue in my opinion. Those require a starter set, which is costly, but allow voice controlled dimming with the Amazon Echo. Understandably, it could be more cost effective to control all of the lights in a room with one WeMo switch by connecting a surge protector (or something with multiple outlets) to one WeMo.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I had been using those RF switched outlets to control lamps, LED lighting, my jukebox, etc. Little remote controls scattered all over my man cave... Now I can simply walk into the room and say ""Alexa, turn on basement lights"". Boom, done. Setup is dead simple, and they've been very reliable thus far. I picked them on sale on Black Friday for about 20 bucks each, and that's about as much as I would pay for them. With competition coming from a ton of different Alexa compatible vendors I would imagine that these will quickly drop to $10-15 each.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Being able to control it via my Amazon Echo is great, but being able to control it via the WeMo app on my phone is even better as it saved me from what I thought was a life-threatening situation- turns out nobody was actually breaking into my house when I used the app to turn on a security device plugged into the WeMo switch, but at the time I thought someone was, and that's all that really matters lol. Laughing now, but it wasn't funny at the time. Regardless, I love this little plug/switch. The only reason I am giving it less than 5 stars is because of the price.

Before You Buy the WeMo,1.0 ,"I bought a used WeMo Switch to try out with my new Echo. Day One - Set up was quick and easy and WeMo worked. Day Two - There was a problem with my Xfinity router and I had to refresh it. Afterwards, Echo stopped recognizing my WeMo. WeMo stopped working and would not reinstall. Day Three - Reset WeMo to its factory default settings and performed the set up again. WeMo is working again, and my Echo is now recognizing it again. Pros - Remote access (when my router is working correctly) Easy set up Works with Echo and iPhone 6 Cons- Temperamental (a router refresh or power outage means you will have to reset the WeMo and do a reinstall) Cost (there is no way I would pay $49 for this device) The WeMo app is buggy (Android and IOS versions both) Size of the outlet UPDATED 06.10.2015: My WeMo switch has lost connection with my wireless home network several times since my review.

"Annoying to set up, but very nice once it is working",4.0 ,"I have set up three of these switches now. Every time, without fail, set up failed the first time, even when I had plugged in the switch only a few feet away from my router. Every time I have found it necessary to do a hard reset of the switch. Every time, doing that hard reset fixed the problem and the next attempt to set up the switch succeeded. Other than that, these switches have been wonderfully convenient now that there are Echo dots scattered around my home; I can turn on my bedroom fan without turning on the lights or getting out of bed, shut off all the power to all the AV components in my home theater setup, and turn on some lights in the basement when I enter via the side door. So, four stars instead of five due to the annoying setup problems, but well worth it if you can get past that problem. Hint: If your switch can't seem to join your home network even though you are sure you gave it the right password, you have run into the same problem as I have. The reset switch is labeled ""reset"" and is located along the top edge of the switch. Unplug the switch, press the reset button, don't let go, plug in the switch while still pressing down on the reset button, and wait until the little light turns amber.

If you can't use the app or don't want to have to depend on the app ""remote"" then don't get this product. What turned this product around for me was the IFTTT (If This Then That) website integration. You can do quite a lot to the WeMo through IFTTT including setting up timers. The timers can be as simple or complex as you want, for example you can have the WeMo turn on a light at sunset or X number of minutes before/after sunset/sunrise. The on/off button on the WeMo is nice to turn on a light (or other device). If I had to only depend on the app to control the WeMo I would have returned it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
great idea... buggy execution,3.0 ,"it exhibits a weird behavior where it keeps switching on and off (like a dozen times a minute) before either finally settling into on (which is what i wanted) or off... which is... not.... i have no idea what would be causing it and they don't have any FAQ regarding it so i'm assuming that this is not a bug they know about or it's not one they know how to fix. really really wanted to like this and it IS cool to be able to turn things on and off with a cellie... but depending on what you plug in, that kind of behavior could be a pretty bad thing to subject your devices to.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Aziz, light! Thank you, Aziz.",4.0 ,"There's an awkward layout between my bed and the nearest light switches. Between that, the fact that I own (and love) an Amazon Echo, and that this was a lightning deal, I figured I'd give it a shot. Took a long time for my Echo to ""get the hang of it,"" but eventually it started recognizing my command to operate the light. I'm not sure why there was a delay, but it's been working pretty consistently ever since. Sometimes Alexa says ""Okay,"" and the light doesn't respond, but it's rare. Btw, I call my light Aziz, if anyone gets the reference.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Delightful product, FYI one cannot connect to Wemo remote access using a VPN",4.0 ,"Wemo products live up to their reputation for ease of use and security. The initial setup was easy, the ""programming"" straightforward. After a few months I switched routers and ran into a problem accessing my Wemo products from my phone, but not the other phones and tablets in the house. It wasn't the router change, it was because I had my VPN active on my phone. It took a while to puzzle that out, it's not something I found in the Help, FAQs, or initial searches of the community.

... a while and for the most part they work fine. However,4.0 ,"I've had my WeMo switches for a while and for the most part they work fine. However, setup can be a bit confusing (each WeMo is basically it's own WiFi hotspot). Once you do get it setup, be prepared for the switch to download a new firmware version, which is kind of pain since you have to do it for each one (I have 6). Setting up integration with your Amazon Alexa is also slightly complicated if you want to group your lights together. If you're tech savvy you shouldn't have any problems, but if you're not, it's best to get a geek friend to set them up for you.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Alexa, do cool stuff for me?",4.0 ,"Love these things. Such an easy solution for making a smart home on the cheap. Works perfectly with Alexa, but if the power goes out or the internet goes down, they have to be reset which is a bit of a pain. Also there are CONSTANT updates for these things. Seems like every time I open the app. But still, the ease of set up, the dependability, the convenience, and showing off in front of the guests make it so much fun to have. Got them on sale for about $30 each and bought 2 for my parents as well.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Good for controlling a limited number of appliances,4.0 ,"Wemo is great for if you want to control a few items. Set up was easy, but you need to update firmware at first option. I set these up to control some appliances. I can effectively disconnect power to the toaster and coffee maker when I leave. I use the wemo motion sensor to turn them back on when I am in the kitchen. The Cons: I used my Belkin energy use monitor and found out that each switch costs about 2.50 per year to operate. That can be much more than the parasite energy consumption of any new appliances you are controlling. They also have a slight delay that can be annoying in certain situations. If you want to do more or build a smart home, go right to smartthings or another z-wave controller.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Surprisingly quick, but unfortunately clunky",4.0 ,"I love almost everything about the WeMo Switch: It's surprisingly quick, I expected it to be kind of slow but it's not at all, the audible click of the relay is surprisingly satisfying, and the power button on the switch was a nice addition. However, the device itself is so unfortunately large, and clunky and makes it near impossible to fit anything else on the same outlet, let alone 2 WeMo switches. It is also somewhat of an eye sore, so if you're looking for something discrete, this is not for you. I'd like to think that the new WeMo mini is just as fast and as well designed as this one but smaller and less obtrusive but I have not got around to buying that one yet. Definitely go with that one if you can spare the cash. Other than that though, great product, 4/5 stars. I would and have recommended to friends and family.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Fantastic product. I purchased two of these to pair ...,5.0 ,"Fantastic product. I purchased two of these to pair up with my Amazon Echo. After downloading the app it took less than 3 minutes to set up. I beefed up my WiFi signal and router a few months ago to 5g, so I was certain that the connection would be good. The app works great and the Amazon Echo (Alexa) pairing was simple and easy. Based on other reviews I decided not to update the WeMo firmware. The switches are working great, so why bother fixing something that is not broken. Until I am certain that the firmware update works and won't cause the switches to malfunction, I will keep the using the current firmware version that was already loaded. Other reviewers that have complaints may consider updating their routers or contact their Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and increasing their outage. If you updated the firmware and the product is now not working, perhaps return the switches, get replacements and keep the firmware as is. I absolutely love these and plan on purchasing several more to automate my home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Literally disconnects for no reason,1.0 ,Just bought 2 of these on Black Friday and both of them don't work consistently at all. They're all updated and I have 5 others in my house but these two will stay connected for about 5-10 minutes and start blinking orange until unplugged and plugged back in. They're only 20 feet away from my 400$ wifi router so it's not a wifi issue. These are garbage. Go buy the TP-Link switch Version.

So far so good,3.0 ,"The most recent app update added the much needed away mode that will allow you to create a schedule wherein lights come on at random intervals, stay on for at least 30 minutes, and go off again. This is important because a smart burglar will look for lamps on a timer. Set-up was easy on 5 of the 6 units, the sixth one required a factory reset before it showed up. The app still needs some work. I find myself force closing the app a little too often because it is out of sync with the actual state of the outlets. Sometimes it fails to load as well on the first attempt. It needs some obvious things like zones for easier timer creation and the ability to separate them on the device screen by categories (lamps, fans, appliances, and custom groups created by the user. Auto refresh would be nice too. I have tried and failed with plenty of products in my desire to have some home automation and unless something drastic changes I believe I have found my answer. UPDATE (05/06/14): App version 1.5.1 FW: 2.00.4494 I am experiencing some issues now. The Away mode does not seem stay within its time constraints. It gives the home an unnatural look if lights are coming on after certain times Even with all the Away mode timers disabled I have lamps coming on at odd times and some lamps not coming on when scheduled.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great smart plug - probably my top choice.,5.0 ,"I absolutely love these little things. I have smart plugs by WeMo, TP-Link, and Iris, and I think the WeMos are my favorite. Set up is easy with the WeMo app, and it connects to my Echo with ease. I also like that the plugs don't cover up the bottom plug on a typical wall outlet. You do need to use the upper plug if you want to use both. The WeMo is pretty shallow, too, and fits behind pretty much any bookshelf or bed like the plug on a power strip would. The construction seems sturdy like it should - not like a cheap piece of plastic. I haven't had any connectivity problems at all since I started using it and I don't anticipate any. All in all, I'm a fan.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Should be great when it works. But in my case it can't connect to WiFi once unplugged. Returning...,2.0 ,"I guess it's a great product when it works. However if something goes wrong, expect to spend quite a bit of time to search for guidance on troubleshooting starting with URL for product or support (found it in fine print on the box; yes, I'm aware of Google search ;-) no, I still like to have URL on the box for the products I paid for). Now I understand why overall rating on Amazon and on other sites is not that great. I configured it when it was plugged in an easily accessible outlet. Everything works great - I can turn it on an off using WeMo app, I have Alexa integration enabled and can see how I'm turning it on and off with my voice. Great, right? Wrong. When I plugged it to the outlet few feet from the easily accessible one it didn't connect to WiFi. OK, let me try another outlet that is even closer to my WiFi router (that is also few feet from all of these outlets). No, it won't connect to WiFi. I don't like this fragility at all. Everything is setup and device has a simple task - connect to specific WiFi once you're plugged in. WiFi signal is strong. Device fails to connect.

Also was such a pain to try to set up via the app, it would ALWAYS fail to connect the first time, and maybe a couple more times after that.

I would hate to have to touch every one of these every ...,4.0 ,"I bought this device to control some electronics with Amazon's Echo. After going through the short setup process through the phone, I tried it out with Echo and it (the Echo) said my Connected Home was not set up and to contact Customer Support. Shortly after a message came up in the Wemo app saying I needed to do a firmware update on the switch. This happened two more times, each about 5 minutes apart. Once the WeMo app said that the switch was on the latest firmware, I tried again to have the Echo find the device and finally had success! It worked flawlessly until this morning when I asked the Echo to turn on the lamp. The Echo responded 'OK' which means it sent the command, but the lamp didn't turn on. I tried a couple more times with the same results. Finally, I walked over to the switch and pressed the blue on button, this seemed to wake up the device and echo was once again able to control it. I'm not sure if this is supposed to work this way or not. I would hate to have to touch every one of these every morning just to be able to control it with the Echo. With it being plugged in, I would assume it would always stay connected to the WIFI. We'll give it more time and see what happens, but that is why only the four stars.

sigh....,3.0 ,"While I love this when it works, it can be so infuriating when it goes wrong. The setup is kind of easy. Sometimes it doesn't find the Wemo. Sometimes when I do the hard reset and set it up all the way to the end the Wemo will not the found as a device and I have to start over again. Sometimes it doesn't find the wifi and so I cannot control it anymore. Sometimes there is a delay from pressing the wemo to the object plugged in turning on. This is a problem because I think it didn't turn on and so I press the button again and then it turns it off. But then again once it works, it's great to have. It's another item that I can setup with my smartthings hub. I really wish the setup was easier than they advertise. Here's my story of trying to get it to work. It took me 15 - 20 minutes to do a hard reset because I thought I could just hold down the restore button while plugged in, but it did not work. The way wemo advertises, it should take a lot quicker than that. I thought it did work at first because my phone found the wemo on wifi, but then could not connect. So I have to do the unplug the wemo, hold down restore button, plug it back in while still holding down the restore button and the release when the light is blinking amber quickly. Even after that, it didn't work completely and I got too frustrated so I gave up and I'll try again later.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Every time there is a firmware update the switches need to be reset. That process can take as long as an hour.

Latest Firmware Upgrades seem to have really stabilized this product!!,5.0 ,"I have 3 Wemo's in total now. When I first bought them I had issues with random disconnects from the network. But since the last firmware upgrades that Belkin have done, they seem to be as stable as a rock!! If you have multiple bridge access wireless zones as I have - I did have issues on occasions with being able to access / see the WEMO from one of more of the remote access points. Again since the last firmware upgraded that issue also seems to have been fixed. I actually love this product - I use it in so many novel ways. Example:- Applied to the input to the PSU on my Gate electromagnetic lock system- I can let someone in to the garden from my I phone without giving out the access code to the front panel from anywhere in the world. I use the feature on a regular basis - Example Fedex delivery can call me at the gate - I let them in by powering PSU off from WEMO, I reset the WEMO on and the gate re locks - they leave the package at the front door and leave using the internal access exit switch to exit.

Will not purchase this product again,1.0 ,"I tend to wait several weeks prior to writing a review to make sure that I have ample time to accurately evaluate product performance. I found the setup a little difficult. Documentation is poor relative to other technical products that I have setup. I have my WeMo switch linked with my Amazon DOT.

I have many other wireless devices in my home that are located three times this distance and have never experienced any problem or dropouts. This has occurred at least once a week for the several weeks that the switch has been installed. I had to constantly unplug an plug the switch in order to connect to my network.

I have a surge protector (not sure if they recommend against that) plugged into one of them,4.0 ,"I bought two of these, setup was straight forward - I plugged it into the wall, switched my wifi to the WeMo, went through the steps and within a few minutes the Switch was working.

I can be in out and about and as the evening approach I can turn on my WeMo switch which will make my bedroom nice and cozy by the time I get home. My second switch is for a light in my living room, it's in an awkward corner and difficult to get to. With the WeMo, it's never been simpler to turn on the light. I have yet to use the timer feature, however WeMos integration with IFTTT makes it even better. I have my living room light go on when the sun sets. It works so well that I've purchased a WeMo light switch. The only complaint I have about the WeMo is the Android Widget. It's very convenient when it works, it's actually awesome when it works. However there are times when the buttons are non-reactive, you click them and nothing happens. You actually have to open the app up and let everything refresh before things work again.

Love it!,4.0 ,"I love these switches! I used to use plugs with remote controls, but it was a pain to have several remotes lying around and trying to figure out which one was which. Right now I have my indoor Christmas lights plugged into these (tree, garlands). I have these set up with my echo dot and I created a group called christmas lights. Now I just ask Alexa to turn on the Christmas lights, and they all come on at once. The only reason for only 4 stars is because the set up with the phone could be easier. With my phone I have to go in and turn off some settings to get the plug info connected. But once it is connected, it works perfectly.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Great product and works with Amazon echo perfectly.,4.0 ,"I currently own 4 of these switches bought on Amazon. I use them with regular floor lamps and control them via the app and Amazon echo via voice. These work wonderful. 2 are setup in my entertainment area and I can turn my lights on and off from the couch with just my voice. The other 2 are setup in my bedroom and I can turn our nigh lights on and off the same way. The only problem I've had is setting up the schedules for when I am away. The app hangs up and won't process the schedule. Besides that, my wife and I love these especially when using the echo. I highly recommend these switches. Only reason for the 4/5 stars is for the app issue.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Will sometimes decide to flash blue and refuse to turn on, even when pressing the power button. Unplugging and plugging back in seems to work every so often to reset the device. Connecting to the network is decently easy, that is when the mobile app doesn't out right crash. The app is worse than the plug, crashing every time I try to turn the device on or off. At least is pairs with the Echo, but even that has a heck of a time trying to connect to this thing. Avoid and go with something better.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great product - Very convenient,4.0 ,"Very useful gadget .. How it works is simply through one of the following options: Option 1: Through mobile App ""Wemo"" to switch on/off lighting or other devices either on the WLAN or remotely from outside. Option 2: Set certain lights at home to switch on/off by sunset/sunrise according to location set by you (in my case for example Manama City in Kingdom of Bahrain). The Sunrise/Sunset are automatically set via internet. Best part is in the morning when we wake up to work and you need that extra 5 minutes to get ready to work instead of going around the house switching off the night lamps. Option 3: [still not tested] through Amazon Echo - Alexa. Vocal commands to perform switch on / switch off Pros: very convenient especially that my wife is pregnant and sometimes it is a hassle for her (when i'm not around) to turn lights on/off around the house. At night we sometimes have to wake up at night and go to daughter's room when she wakes up. This is a good feature to turn on daughter's room lighting before we reach to her, just to comfort her when she wakes up in the middle of the night. Another good option is to control house lighting while away from home. Cons: Some switches work on WLAN and are not detected remotely while others are totally the opposite and they keep on refreshing and sometimes they appear and other times they are ""Not Detected"" Therefore I have set some of them to automatic on/off option One of the switches has a small buzzing sound something like the old internet dial up sound but a little more discrete. Not sure whether it is faulty (although it is functioning well). Overall the product is really nice and I would greatly appreciate if Belkin can create a device that can control Air Conditioning working with IR remote controls and also to have more options and sizes for light switches.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love this little wemo and I want more of them,4.0 ,"I really like the little wemo switches. I have two now and want to add many more. The biggest issue I've had with these is that if they are blocked a bit by something, they may lose wifi signal. It's only happened a couple of times on one of mine and after I moved it a bit I think I've solved the issue. I love the easy integration with Amazon Echo / Alexa.

Working great!,5.0 ,"I got the plug to help me turn on/off a hard-to-reach lamp behind the couch. I realized I had to turn off the cell service on my phone in order to keep 'belkin wifi' connected during installation. As soon as I figured that out, the rest was a breeze. It works well and seamlessly with my echo. The only thing I wish could improve is to get rid of the clicking sound every time turning on/off the plug. It's a little loud and bothers my dogs. It probably reminds them the annoying clicker during dog training. Anyway, it's a great product!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

UNRELIABLE! what is automation if you have to physically be there to reset the device when it disconnects.,2.0 ,"wow be prepared for the most unreliable product to ever hit the market. my dell tablet is more reliable than this thing. I give 2 stars because when it works, it just works. Well, aside from the app being super slow to load and search for devices... albeit it still works. But for random reasons unexplained, the outlet will become not connected to the network, and the only way you can get it back on the network is to pull it out and plug it back in. Not even pressing the physical buttons on the outlet will reconnect it... it seriously needs a pull out and in maneuver. So... at a time you want to activate it, and you are not near the outlet, you are out of luck until you go back to the outlet and physically 'reset' it. This is horrendous for a product that sells itself for automation... just hope that if you have something you absolutely need turned on remotely, that it will be connected when you need to. Myself, I use it as remote garage door opener to let guests in when I am not around. The fact that I can't rely on this defeats the purpose of why I bought it... but hell it works sometimes, I just have to cross my fingers, and even when it works, I would do a hard reset the morning of if I am sure I will need to activate it","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

My espresso machine is preheated when I wake up -- Bliss!,4.0 ,"I need my coffee first thing. I have this switch turn on my espresso machine before I wake up so that it is preheated and ready to go when I am. This device was easy to set up using my iPhone. I used the app to connect to the switch wirelessly and connected it to my 5th-gen Airport Extreme router. Had to reset it after daylight savings time hit last fall. Recently had to reset the switch again when it started having trouble connecting to my router and then finally failed. Turned out to be the router going bad, not the switch's fault at all. I could accomplish most of this with a cheap light timer, but if I wake up early or late, I can hit the switch from upstairs using my iPad. Then by the time I make it to the kitchen, the espresso machine is preheated.

"It has a cute, surprised face, but horrendously unreliable",2.0 ,"I bought this just like everyone else, to pretend that we're at home while hundreds of miles away on vacation. We used with a light by the window and tried with the app on my iPhone. The set up was very easy even for a technologically-challenged gal like me. We were so excited, and well, the timer worked half the time, and sometimes the light turned on few minutes later but most of the time it didn't turn on at all. And turning on via app was the same; sometimes it turned on and other times it didn't. We decided that it was not reliable enough and ditched it. A switch that worked via wi-fi is such a nice concept, and it's so miserably unreliable. Now it's sitting on my desk, greeting me with the cute, surprised look on the front.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Unreliable,2.0 ,"I'm frustrated with these plugs. They are hit or miss. I've connected them to Alexa and they work consistently on a schedule, but whenever I ask Alexa to turn them off or on, she usually replies that they're not responding. And if I try to use the Wemo app to turn them on or off, it often indicates the plug is not detected. So I have to get up and push the button on the plug to turn them on or off, totally negating their purpose. Not to mention that they are so large, there are not many other items with a plug small enough to make use of the other outlet. Also, they seem to require an update every few months and every time, the update locks up, gets stuck for over 24 hours, and I ultimately have to manually reset them altogether and reconnect them to Alexa. I'm over it. I just purchased replacements from another major brand. I already have 2 from that brand in another room, and those work without fail. I'm giving two stars because I knew about their likelihood of blocking the second outlet when I bought them and they do work properly when a schedule rule is programmed.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

If it's only mildly hot outside, then I have the option of turning-on just one. The company is routienly updating the app, always seeming to make improvements where they can. I never had any problem with the app, but they still seem to find ways to make it better.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Full disclosure, I installed this in my grandparents living room so that they could get some lighting without having to navigate through darkness or fumble for a switch. Of course, when I learned that with the Wemo app I can turn the light on and off from anywhere things... got a bit out of hand. Thankfully the grandparents were entertained with the ""mysterious"" light that would go on and off during their evening newspaper reading and tennis watching, so it all turned out okay, and they are much more comfortable telling Alexa what to do now!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Beware this is old dated product,2.0 ,Could not pass up the 20.00 price on Amazon this weekend so I ordered 2 switches to go with the 6 I already had. First off this is old inventory that is not comparable with Apple Home Kit. Also the firmware was old and will not update. As a result I can no longer get to my rules because this product requires all switches on the network be running the same firmware. The only thing that works is turning the switches on and off from the app. No rules No Iffft. I sent an email to Belkin support. I'm not holding my breath.

Awesome for the novelty factor. Wouldn't trust it for vital activities.,4.0 ,"Full disclosure - I'm a tech nerd, so I think anything ""smart"" and controllable with my phone is pretty awesome. That being said, I really like this WeMo. What I don't like is the Android app that controls it. Up until recently, the app was utterly unusable - as in, it simply did not work. It would consistently crash, and when it didn't, functions like rules just wouldn't work. With the latest update, however, the app seems to be pretty stable and I've been able to control my standing floor lamp well.

It can be turned on/off immediately when I touch the switch on the app. 2. Easy to setup. Just follow the guide, it's not hard to set up it, even though it's no so fast. Cons: 1. The app on Android sucks. It's the worst app I have used. I can hardly input the device name and change the time because the weird app design. It doesn't follow any Android style design! 2. Still the app on Android, I cannot edit the rules after I set it up, it keeps showing ""looking for rules"". It's a serious bug. Therefore, I have to use IFTTT which is a good replacement of the timing rules. But it need the Internet working since the rule is in the cloud and compared with the local rules, you have to accept 3~10 minutes lag with IFTTT. 3. Fortunately, there's a third party app as a replacement of official app. Even though it gets 4.5 stars on the Play market, it doesn't mean that it way more better to use. Lag is still the main problem even with the direct switch.

A Staple for any Home ...not just smart ones,5.0 ,"I was a fairly early adopter of all things smart home ...even when I just had an apartment. So with Belkin being one of the pioneers in smart home integration, its natural that I tried this out. I've used the D-Link smart plugs as well, but Belkin is the best by far. I now use about 4 of these (and one smart switch) on a daily basis. The setup is simple, the application allows for easy control of devices (whether you're home or not), and even allows for custom schedules, a great feature for when you're traveling and want to give off the appearance of being home. I use mine mainly for lights but there are so many useful features and applications for these plugs (lights, fans, kids' tv control *wink*). Highly recommend this.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

As the nights get cold, I have to get the electric heater turned on out in the shop by 4 AM some days in order to heat things up by the time I get out there. I used to have to get up crazy early to fiddle with a circuit breaker to make it happen. Now, I just check the nightly temperature forecast, pick a time, and set my cell phone WeMo app to turn on the heater through the wifi. So far, it has worked every time, and I don't have to get up early just to turn on the power and go back to bed. Since it has never failed, I give it five stars.

There's nothing in the core programming that does this, and the partnered programming app ifttt takes around 5 minutes to respond. I wound up downgrading to simple wireless switches to complete my pseudo two way switch, which worked wonderfully. Overall, I'll still use these switches for other purposes, but know they're not as robust as they portray themselves.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
UPDATED REVIEW: It's working okay now.,4.0 ,"UPDATE: Some updates have this working well enough now so I bought two additional ones. HINT: I have better luck using the Apple version of the app (on my iPod) than the Android version (on my phone). ORIGINAL REVIEW: Worked well ... for about a week. Switch no longer broadcasts WiFi. I'm giving up after 6+ hours trying all of the support instructions on their website (which are minimal and poor), troubleshooting my WiFi network including setting it up from scratch, trying to contact/communicated with their support, etc.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
This product is a piece of junk,1.0 ,"This product, #1 is a good concept but that's all there is to it, a GOOD concept. Not a good product. We really hoped for the best and thought, wow what a great way to turn on and off our radio at home to scare away the racoons in our house. Or potential burglars right? But no avail. The product has very poor reception in the house. We have a drop cam in the same area and hands down the drop cam had better reception than this device. All in all, it never worked and we are happy to have returned it. Another irksome thing about it is that it takes up the whole outlet, both of them including the one on the bottom. Don't let the pic deceive you. You will not be able to plug anything else on the outlet and the device only has space for 1 device to be plugged in to it. Poor design &b does not work.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Frustrating setup, seems to be finally working, but afraid to adjust anything further",3.0 ,"I am a pretty tech savy guy and have lots of misc internet connected gadgets, and this has probably been the most frustrating one to set up and working consistently. First of all, while it did initially connect using them, it seems this WeMo is not fully compatible with WPA2 keys with special characters in them. It seems to only like keys with letters and numbers. After my WeMo lost connectivity and had to be factory reset about 10 times, I finally gave up and created virtual wifi network just for the WeMo with a much simpler WPA2 key using only letters and numbers. The app seems pretty flaky as well. I use Android, and the app does not appear to follow any sort of modern Android UI standards. It seems like something that was ported from maybe the iOS version, or slapped together quickly. I was prompted to install several firmware updates through the app, but I ended up locking the WeMo up several times during this to where it needed to be factory reset again, and had to start over. The firmware update has no status bar to know when it is done, it just says it will take about 10 minutes, and makes some dumb joke about how you can go play Angry Birds while you wait. Once I got it going, I went into the rules section of the app, just looking around, and ended up crashing the WeMo during the process (or it was a good coincidence anyways). So now that I got it back working again, I am basically afraid to touch anything else in fear of having to factory reset it and start over again. I placed a call to tech support before I figured out the whole WPA2 special characters issue, which they took me through some very basic troubleshooting steps, and then decided to elevate me to level 2 support, who I have been playing phone tag with for 3 days. To wrap up my long winded story, it works now, I don't know how reliable it will be, and the firmware and app seem beta quality at best. I hope it stays working. I only recommend this to people with simple network keys and the will to mess around with it to get it working.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Works well - Setup somewhat confusing,4.0 ,"Works well with my Echo Dot. Hardest part was the WeMo app setup. App wants to send you to a tutorial that is not totally clear and won't let you transfer to the setup steps during the tutorial. Shifting from WeMo app to phone settings to Alexa app was confusing. Didn't try it but I wonder if the WeMo app would work on a Kindle Fire. If not then you had better have a smartphone handy or you will not be able to do the setup. But after all that, the switch works very well with the Dot.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Good for unimportant stuff but has a major flaw for anything where staying on while you're gone is important.,3.0 ,"Warning: This device will keep whatever device is plugged into it off after any kind of power interruption. It does not remember whether it was on or off when it lost power and maintain that state so instead it will default to off every time the power flickers. If you just want to turn some random light/appliance in your home on/off and it wouldn't be an emergency if that thing stays off until you notice it, this is probably a good product and priced appropriately. This may or may not be an issue for you depending on your application but since I was trying to run a water circulation pump with it to keep water lines from freezing, this simply wouldn't work for my application. I've gone with one of the Samsung Smart Things hubs and outlets even though they cost significantly more. You get far more options to go with a correspondingly higher price tag. Giving it 3 stars because it didn't work for me but I realize I have an unusual requirement. It would be kind of annoying for most people and a nonissue for some but it really shouldn't be happening.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Unreliable at best.,1.0 ,"Doesn't accept modern WiFi Security. Alpha Numeric doesn't suffice for WPA2 and that is all it tolerates for your WiFi Passwords. It is a joke that they claim that this thing is compatable. I don't wish to compromise my entire network for one poorly designed device. Even when I tried conforming and configuring my network to satisfy their poorly published needs I found the device and their software to be unreliable at best. Edit: Below is a Tip directly quoted from Belkin support for clarification as to my issue with this product. ""Troubleshooting your WEMO connection to the Wi-Fi network"" ""Tip 4: Make sure your router’s wireless network (SSID) is set to broadcast or not hidden. Otherwise, your WEMO device may have difficulties connecting and maintaining a connection to it. WEMO supports WPA2 passwords of eight (8) to 63 characters comprised of letters and numbers only. WEMO will fail to connect to your network if your wireless password contains any spaces or symbols in it.

Good product that does what it says.,4.0 ,"This item works as advertised. Installation. Very easy and straight forward. Plug unit in, install app on smart phone. Create account. Connect smartphone to WeMo via WiFi. Follow instructions. However, the unit did not pick up my WiFi (although it picked up my neighbors). I moved to closer location, completed setup, and moved back to desired location. Pros: a. Easy remote control of lights b. Able to schedule lights for on / off periods. c. Echo control via IFTTT. d. Installs in top wall-outlet w/o interfering with bottom outlet. Cons: a. Pricy for functionality. b.

"Easy to set up, very useful with Alexa!",5.0 ,"I love these switches. They are extremely easy to set up. You can get the WeMo app and control the switches through the app as long as they are connected to wifi at all times. Extremely easy to connect with Alexa as well if you have an amazon echo product. Always turning on/off lights with Alexa. I have 2 of these smart plugs and planning on buying more. One neat feature I use is that I create a ""group"" through the Alexa app, and I can tell Alexa to turn off all of the lights to make sure that the switches turn off. Very useful when leaving home in a hurry.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Very impressed with the reliability of this unit after trying the cheaper models.,5.0 ,We chose this device after trying a cheaper version that was too unreliable. We needed a remote control switch that we could rely on to reset an automation and security system while we are away from our vacation home. We've had this unit for a few months now and it has been completely reliable when accessed and actuated remotely. The price seemed too high at first but after trying the cheaper versions we are happy to pay the difference to have a switch that we know will work when we need it. It was very easy to setup using iOS an Android. We have not needed the scheduling capability but it seemed very easy and straightforward.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great for turning lights on while away from house,4.0 ,"This switch works with your wifi and allows you turn turn your lights or other electronic items on and off via your cell phone. This was pretty easy to figure out and the app was easy to find in the app store. This gets four stars as you are supposed to be able to program specific on and off times using the app. However, I cannot get the program function to work with this switch and must manually turn it on and off. When trying to use the program feature the switch disconnected from the app several times and had to be reset.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
a must have,5.0 ,I purchased this for my Amazon Echo... but didnt want to wait until I got the echo.. so I installed it right away .. took maybe 5 minutes to set up and I was able to turn my light on and off from my phone.. It is wonderful I used it afterwards for my christmas tree to keep from having to go behind the tree and step on the plug..

Hit or Miss - Be ready to return the garbage ones,1.0 ,"These things are hit or miss and Belkin knows it. Sometimes they don't work at all and sometimes they work on the first try. Sometimes they work for awhile, a couple of months and then they quit working. I've bought so many of these things and had to return more than half of them. Be ready to test them and make sure they work and hope they work for more than a couple of months. I think they ran into a bad chipmaker and didn't do QA on the production line. Just be ready to return them, because most likely if they they don't work from the beginning, they'll never work.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
only buy if you have the time and patience to deal with this frustrating product,2.0 ,"i bought this for some patio lighting and at first it worked ok, for about a month. it took about 20 minutes to set up with my iphone 6 and an old linksys router. then after a month it just stopped working. no wireless network changes, nothing new. i spent hours trying to get it to work again without success. then i bought a new linksys router in Dec2015. I gave it another shot and it took about 2 hrs of changing network settings, reading online recommendations and resetting the switch until it finally worked. i'm not sure what actually did the trick. there is no reason it should take this much time and frustration to get something like this to work. i would not recommend any one buy this unless you have the time and patience for it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I got a second one and am currently using it for the Christmas tree, but plan to rename it and use it elsewhere in the house after the holidays. I've had no issues with the plugs in the last 5 months since I got the first one. The setup is easy and the timer is nice and simple. Plus, you can turn your lights on and off or set the timer from anywhere you have Internet connection. If you are looking at the light switch (wall toggle replacement), you have to have a third, neutral wire for constant power.

Love it,5.0 ,"Have 3 of these and 2 wemo switches. Absolutely love how easy things have been. It was a little confusing first setting up the ""turn on at sunset and off at sunrise"" settings, but a quick YouTube video helped. Now things work perfectly. One thing I learned was you can add multiple rules to the devices. For a long time, I had a Monday to Friday setting to have the lights on in the evening (when we got home until bedtime). On the weekends, I would have to do things manually....until I realized you could do multiple rule sets. Now I have a bunch of rules that control mornings, evenings, and weekends. Life is good.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Good, but not the best out there",3.0 ,"These are in general pretty good but some times they do act up and disappear from your network at random. The work directly with Alexa once set up correctly to power on or off a plug in appliance or lamp or the like. You can also set up schedules and manipulate these applainces so long as your network is up and you have Internet where you are trying to operate the switch. I use these for lamps that comprise my light path. So Alexa tells them to turn on so I can see where I'm going. Again, once they are on and stable they are pretty solid, but I've had much fewer issues with the zwave switches and outlets that are hard wired. In terms of convenience though these are plug and play and a great way to make sure that home automation is something that you can or can't live without. Test, but don't judge the current smart home technologies out there by this switch!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I've used them for over a year now and love having access to my lights via an app and setting rules for when they come on and off and being able to turn them on/off via the app. It's just cheap perfect home automation. My only complaint would be that they are so big, they really need to work on getting them to be a smaller size, otherwise they work great! I use them on lamps but plan on also trying the light switches as well. Once you try this, you'll never go back. It also works on my Android and iOS devices so even guest when they come and get on my WiFi they can download the app and if they get up in the night or something they can switch on the lights or talk to Alexa (Amazon Echo)","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Wonderful Product,5.0 ,"I really like this WeMo switch! There were a few reviews that really made me skeptical especially when it came to how these work or lack there of with certain wireless conditions. I have a setup that people complained about so I figured I would have only mixed success with this switch. Turns out that when it came, it works marvelously. Super easy to setup. Easy to schedule. No more plucking tiny prongs out of a manual timer or having to deal with lost power or timers that don't keep time right. These problems are all solved with this device. Can't say enough great things about it. Only thing I miss is the multi-socket versions of some timers. I guess all I need to do is plug in a 3-way but it would be nice to have version of the switch that just has extra sockets. Another super handy feature is being able to turn anything on with a touch of a button whether it is in the app or on the device itself. Perfect and great thinking Belkin! Can't wait for 3-way light switch modules. Please hurry! :)","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
A great addition to our home security plan,4.0 ,"Useful function, plus impressive results. I purchased this switch for it's functionality… and it delivers. But it also really impresses my friends based on its performance. If you travel frequently, you'll probably find the WeMo switch useful. You can turn lights on and off at unpredictable times… And that makes home security a bit more secure. Plus, if we're away longer than expected, we can switch on a light on the way home.

Goes off on its own once in a blue moon,3.0 ,"I got a couple of these to allow me to restart security cameras remotely. It does great except for the mornings when I wake up and the cameras are off and I didn't turn them off. The switch turns itself off once in a blue moon. I have no schedules set up or anything it just goes off until I open the app and turn it on again. I have now disabled ""remote access"" which basically opens it up to Internet to see if that solves my issue. So just be cautious on what you control if it is something essential that can never go off without your permission then don't hook it up to this.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I put the projector on this switch, WEMO bulbs in my lamps, and the WEMO Maker on my electric screen's 12v trigger port (my projector doesn't have a 12v trigger for a screen so used to have to use another remote just for the screen). By using recipes on IFTTT.com, I can use my iPhone to turn on the projector which also triggers the screen to come down and the lights to gradually go off (I set them to fade over a minute but I could do them suddenly or even slower than a minute).

Pricey with a terrible app,3.0 ,"First of all I think all the smart outlets are way overpriced. So this one is no exception in that aspect. Hopefully prices will come down soon. In order to set it up you have to install the WeMo app. The app is terrible and needs way too many permissions.In the setup you have to connect to the your wifi then the outlet and then back to your wifi. It connected to my SmartThings hub, but it is not support by Belkin or Samsung so if you have problems you are on your own. It is working with my SmartThings automations. When I run discovery on my Amazon Echo it finds it twice once in the SmartThings hub and once as a stand alone device. When it it functions it has few millisecond delay compared my GE z wave outlet. I am planning on using all zwave but wanted to try a wifi device. Overall this is okay. The WeMo app is terrible and a security concern. Once I setup the device I removed the app.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I've already spent 4 times the cost of the unit taking notes, talking on the phone to Amazon and trying to re-connect the device. 4 times the re-connect was easy, 2 times very difficult and this last time impossible... Even though I am past the 30 day window for return, I will return it and if they give me a hard time I'll return the 2nd Echo I purchased just to be able to activate one stupid switch.

Every time the cable goes out and you lose your internet connection, you will have to reconnect them. I have 1 out of the 3 that will automatically reconnect but the other two, I have to go through the whole setup process.

"It generally worked (out of box was best, later firmwares caused more problems than they fixed)",4.0 ,"Update: upped to 4 stars Firmware/app issue were mostly corrected.

Problems/bugs with device software and app, will edit review if they are fixed. I assume they eventually will be. Won't work on some of my android devices, and some will only work in the house wifi network and not remotely. It generally worked (out of box was best, later firmwares caused more problems than they fixed), but never really seemed to operate completely right. For example, I set up a timer to turn on a light for a few hours each night. For some reason, the light would turn itself off and on multiple times within that period and there didn't seem to be anything I could do about it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
don't bother,1.0 ,"Look, the product and idea itself is great. But the software is completely effed up. iPhone or android, it doesn't matter. The sunset thing doesn't work. The plain time on works, sort of, if turning on within 30 minutes (before or after) counts as ""working"" (I was very disappointed with that; I am deaf and was going to use it as an alarm clock). The turn on until time simply doesn't work -- I set it to turn on at 8:30 and turn off at 11pm; it comes on roughly 8:30ish kind of and then starts turning itself off every 15 minutes after that. So then you're stuck with a light that you have to sign into your phone to turn on or off (argh). Or you punch the button on the socket...which is behind the bed or whatever. They don't even sell plain remotes with this, the ""switch"" is an actual wall mounted plate switch you have to install. Waste of time & money.

They also work from a phone app so if you aren't home and want to turn on a light or if you are on vacation and don't want the house to be dark all the time you can work the outlets from the app or even set a timer. They are great little devices and super easy to set up!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love my wemo switch,5.0 ,"Love my wemo switch. I use it every time we go out on vacation. I love the ability to make my lights come in when the sun goes down and then off when the sun rises. Great product, worth every penny I realize how important a good review is to a buyer. I give honest and heart felt reviews on products that a purchase and receive.

Works but hard to estup,3.0 ,"Once you get it setup, it does work well. I used it at Christmas for the Christmas lights, which was nice to put on an automatic schedule (on & off) and it was fun to turn them on & off via my smartphone. But the setup process was anything but smooth. The unit acts like a wifi hotspot for the initial setup, which means you tell your smartphone to connect via wireless to the WeMo's wireless signal. Then you configure it to connect to your wireless router (which means supplying your wireless password so the WeMo can connect to your network. That part worked okay. From there, it went downhill. You have to know to switch your smartphone back to your wireless network and re-launch the WeMo app on your phone, but in my case, I had to kill (end-task) the WeMo app at least once throughout the ordeal before it would connect with the WeMo. I think I had to also reboot (turn the WeMo off & on) too, before it all worked. So definitely this was a rough setup process. But the WeMo worked fine afterwards.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Pain to setup but GREAT after that,5.0 ,Works as it should AFTER you rack your brains trying to get it set up. What should have been easy took me 30 minutes. The TP-Link smart plug I also purchased took me all of 3 minutes to get running. After getting this running it works as you'd expect though so still 5 stars.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Works great, easy setup, but large size takes up space",4.0 ,"While i can't complain about how the plug works or setting it up, I can really only complain about the actual size of the plug. It's quite big for just one plug. I bought two, one for each of my kids rooms so they can control their lights in their rooms with their Alexa dots. When you plug it into an outlet, don't expect anything else to get plugged in there. So then I bought 2 belkin USB plugs that have 6 outlets. Even with that because of the design and position of the outlets, I couldn't plug in a clock or anything else. So keep that in mind when purchasing it. If that is the only thing you have to plug in, your golden. Other than that, no complaints. Maybe future technology will make plugs smaller. I bought these because of the good price Alexa had it for.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"The Clapper, 2.0",5.0 ,"This is really a cool product. I got it up and running in less than 5 minutes. I love being able to turn my lamp from anywhere, whenever I want. The app was super easy to navigate. The only reason I am not completely satisfied is because I purchased this to link up with my Ring Pro doorbell (which I also love). I wish there was a setting in the Ring app to turn on the light from their app. The current setting just opens up the Wemo app. This isn't necessarily Wemo's fault, which is why I didn't take any stars off. I will likely buy more Wemo products in the future.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Not a bad little device.,5.0 ,"I use this thing to turn on/off an electric fireplace insert using my iPad. There were some negative reviews so I wasn't sure if it was going to be a reliable appliance or not as to get access to it I'd have to dissemble the front of the fireplace. I have it located inside a metal fireplace insert on a outlet I installed to power the fireplace, so I wasn't sure how well it would work in that metal box. The darned thing works pretty well. Sometimes when you start the app it spends a few seconds looking for the thing but it always seems to quickly find it and always turns the electric fireplace insert on/off. One time the app lost all contact with the thing but poking the reset/restart (?) button with a long matchstick through the front grill of the fireplace restarted it and it's worked fine since. Notified me there was a firmware update but it seemed never to complete the update process but the old firmware worked just fine. Finally updated itself. Used it a couple of months now and it works pretty well. If I had a use for another one I'd probably buy it again as I've had pretty good luck with this one. Also, I'm using a older linksys router and Apple devices to control this switch. Judging by some of the reviews it might work better with some wireless routers than others.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Honestly it's probably a little pricey for what it does but I love gadgets. I also only use it in the bedroom but it's nice to not have to get up and turn off a light if I'm starting to doze. Also if you put this in your living room and set it up so when you arrived home it automatically turns on (using ITTT or some other neat app) it could be really nice to not walk into a dark home. I'm just using it for basic on and off but it works flawlessly and has never one time dropped a connection from wifi.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Handy but so bulky and must use extension to pair items,3.0 ,"I use this and the mini with Alexa. They work as intended, but both are bulky because the plugs can only go in front (vs. side) - so behind a furniture or in floor outlet you have the added depth of the plug you are inserting into the wemo. Also, they should make it so you can put a pair of matching lamps into a single control. Instead I have to put an extension with multi-outlets into the Wemo just to control two lamps on same schedule.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Buggy installation process, not worth the trouble",1.0 ,"I have tried twice unsuccessfully to install this WeMo switch to replace an older one that worked fine for years and then didn't. I consider myself to be pretty capable in terms of tech and gadgets but this device failed over and over again to connect to my wireless network, among other problems. I read a lot of other Amazon reviews and the support forums at WeMo and it seems that I'm not the only one who ran into bugs throughout the installation process. I don't get it. Connecting to a wireless network should be easy. It's definitely not with this product. Disappointing and a waste of time.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Fun times with wifi and home automation...,4.0 ,I travel extensively for work (I'm an electrician) and I'm always seeking ways to save $$ on the utility bills when I'm not home. I've installed a Nest Thermostat and have seen some savings from it's auto away feature - however my electric water heater doesn't have the same feature - until now. Fully 50% of my home electricity usage is in heating water so why not shut if off when I'm not home? I use this switch to control a 120V coil 2 pole relay ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z0RLL2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) and have it tied to my Nest thermostat's status via IFTTT.com - whenever my thermostat goes to 'away' my water heater will be shut off as well.

"Better than decent, not quite perfected.",4.0 ,"I purchased this to use a lamp that plugs in behind the couch, and isn't easy to get to. While it takes a few seconds longer to open our phones, open the app, and hit the power button, I don't mind because we control it from outside the house as well when we're about to come inside, so it's a small price to pay for walking into a lit house without the waste of electricity on all day. My deduction of one star comes from the app. Sometimes, it takes thirty seconds to connect to the lamp, and takes another ten for the power button to turn it on. This happens 10% of the time, and is not something that has caused any regret in purchasing. I'm still happy with it. I have all Apple computers, and a time capsule airport extreme, and this works wonderfully with it, so if you are a Mac person, have no concerns. I do not use the ""rules"", but love that they're there. You can program the light to automatically come on and off as you set them, and I think that's great! Such a good idea. Hope this helps!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It works great once it's online and active,4.0 ,"It works great once it's online and active. We use it with IFTTT and control the lights with Google Home. I switched the WIFI account this connected to and had to do a manual reset, holding down random buttons for random amounts of time, before it would engage again. Moved it back to the other room and had to do it again. Took forever to figure out how to get the reset to happen and it to start broadcasting again. That was really annoying, so I'm dropping a star.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

When she forgets to turn the lamp posts on while she is out, she asks me to turn them on for her. I live 2 hours away in another state but all I have to do is say to my Echo “Alexa, turn on Lamp Posts” and bam, her lights are on. Sure, she could use the Wemo app to turn them on herself but she is not that technically savvy yet. I can’t speak of the durability of the switch yet as it has only been installed a few weeks but I can say it is working great and has gone beyond my expectations. I have not had the connectivity issues like some other users. My switch has stayed connected and has reliably stayed connected and controlled by Alexa at both my mom’s house where it is installed and 120 miles away at my house via my Echo (note we both use and share the same Amazon account allowing multiple Alexa Echos on the same account).","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

The set-up was fairly straightforward and very quick using the app on my smartphone. The power switch is a negative for me right now because I have very small children, who push the light (the switch is a light). Other than that, I don't have any complaints. I've never tried any other Wi-Fi enabled switches, so I have nothing to compare.

Once in about 20 tries, it would click the switch once, and then gray out. After a lot of searching the web, I finally discovered the trick: you have to DISable remote access.

Works well but Difficult set-up,3.0 ,"Bought this to go along with my Echo Dot. Plugged up a lamp in the plug. Works really well now! The most difficult part was the initial set-up of the plug. It has it's own ""WeMo"" app that you download so you have to separately tell Alexa to ""find devices"" while you're setting up the plug with your app. Some other brands you can integrate the app with Alexa so it can automatically link up.

But being able to set up one touch rules for when going on vacation. And eliminating the timers on my backyard/porch lights. And giving me one centralized spot for all my controlled lights is very convenient. Especially when you are heading to the airport and realized you forgot to set the lights to vacation mode.

The app is rather slow and very poor UX. clicking button don't give any feed back on which you click, no feed back which wifi you're trying to connect to (did you fat finger the wrong one?

Great idea that just isn't reliable for what is intended.,1.0 ,"This is a great concept where belkin hasn't shown the product to be ""ready for prime time"". Setup is easy enough. Biggest problems I have are 1. After power or wifi go down, the devices don't reconnect reliably. A manual reset of the switch is frequently necessary 2. The app is quirky, often unable to show rules that were set up when running it remotely. Again, being on the local network where the switches are is required defies the idea of reliable remote management of my devices. I am using these switches to manage devices at our cottage so I don't have to drive 4 hours to flip a switch. On any given day, I can' be certain that I will be able to connect remotely and be able to monitor or manage these switches.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Now she plugs in to this and when we leave the house, and she starts worrying that she left her curling iron on, she can pull up the WeMo app on her phone and turn off that socket. So even if she forgot to unplug or turn off something it wont burn down her house. Then she can relax and have a good time with me..which is nice, because I'm pretty awesome. She's never had a problem with it and even uses it to freak out her roommates occasionally by plugging a lamp into it and turning it off/on when she's not home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Good plugs when they're working,3.0 ,"Picked this up due to the price break. Good plugs when they're working. Or, showing in the app at least. Lots of times the plug is working through IFTTT, Alexa, or other third party controllers, but sometimes the devices show as not detected in the WeMo app. Usually, in time, they will mysteriously show back up but by that time, I have completed the task using a different method.

At first, I thought it was an issue with the echo but then I would open my Wemo app and it would say they are not detected. I have the firmware up to date. and they should not have connection issues since I live in a small apartment with one bedroom. They sit within 10 feet of the router.

Great entry into home automation.,3.0 ,"*Update* Recently made some changes to the home WiFi setup and wanted to add that reconfiguring the Wemo switches was aggravating. The Wemo app or hardware does not play well after making network changes, therefore, I changed my rating to 3 stars. If you're not likely to make network changes then Wemo switch gets 4 stars. I chose these since they natively paired with the Alexa Echo and the Nest thermostat. The switches don't work with the auto sensing Nest Away mode as well as I would like, but they do the job when switched Away manually. Had to experiment with the Wemo rules to get the switches to work like I wanted, but that's to be expected.

Easy Home Automation,5.0 ,"This system is brilliant. I had mine up and working in just minutes - and it works perfectly. I can imagine if your wifi signal in the house is not constant and reliable, this system won't be either. One other item of note - if the plugs are too far from the router (ex : router on opposite side of the house on second floor, plug on the lower wall of basement) it may not work reliably or connect at all. I did have to put a manual timer down there as opposed to this wemo plug. No harm no foul though, no one goes down there with any frequency, and controlling upstairs to me is more important. People are totally impressed with this system, and its relative cost effectiveness to other systems. While I haven't set up the If-Then events, I would, in a proper situation.

If I had tons more money, I'd buy them for every outlet in the house; they look so sleek and smart! And I love being able to set a timer so that certain appliances turn on at certain times and off at others. Orvibo... not so much. Definitely returned it and am sold on the WeMo. Revised: 11/3/17: I had this product for a few months and then suddenly, it stopped working. No apparent reason. I've tried getting in the Belkin website to try and return it or file a claim or something but no such luck. Will not be buying Belkin again and wouldn't suggest this product to anyone.

This plug will let you turn on or off any outlet either through voice commands through the Echo, or the Wemo app on its own. An added bonus I didn't realize when initially purchasing was that I could actually utilize the Wemo app from anywhere. Shouting at the walls to turn off the lights is one thing, but turning on the AC window unit so your house is the right temp right when you get home, that's easily worth the sticker price.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I use my wemos to schedule the lighting I use for my fish tanks. This is really important for planted tanks to provide consistent lighting durations. With this product I am able to remotely check if my lights are on or off, remotely turn my lights on or off and set up a ""Rule"" that if I turn my lights on outside of the scheduled time, I can have them automatically turn off after X amount of time.

Received open box item. It didn't work.,2.0 ,"I can't say whether this switch will do its job or not. The item I received was in an open box and it didn't work. The LED would light, but it would not sync with any of four different WiFi devices (correction: my original comment said BlueTooth) with the WeMo app. I spent at least several hours on the Belkin WeMo troubleshooting pages and with technical support. I reset the device, etc., etc. I sent the item back to Amazon and they refunded my money immediately. I am guessing that someone had already returned this specific example, but based on the feedback on the Belkin site it appears that these devices may have a problematic design or firmware; i.e. sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, and sometimes they quit. It is a great concept, but I'll wait for the next generation device before I try this again.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Compatible with the Amazon Echo?????,5.0 ,"I purchased two of these a couple weeks ago and the set up was flawless and they work perfectly. However, these two additional units cannot connect to the WeMo server and, thus, cannot be activated. I don't know why this is an issue and have yet to hear from the Belkin people on what the issue is and how to address it for correct installation and use with Amazon Echo. Addendum: I sent them back and received replacements. Same issue using the WeMo app with my IPAD ios 9.1. Kathrena from Belkin, who has been working with me on this suggested that I might use another device to see if we could isolate the problem area. i used my Kindle Fire and, lo and behold, the devices fired right up, the WeMo app worked just fine and the issue is resolved. Don't know what the problem was with the IPAD, but the app just did not work. Perhaps, the Belkin folks might just want to update their app a bit. Anyhow, with all issues resolved, I am most happy with the WeMos doing what they are supposed do. They work fine and I endorse the product without reservations at all. Thanks for all the help from the Belkin people and, especially, Kathrena who baby walked me through all of this.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great & now using it for washing machine notifications! (important washing machine tip),4.0 ,"I use a Wemo in wall switch, a couple of their plug in switches, a Wemo Maker on my garage door & now an Insight Switch to notify me (& my wife) when the washing machine is finished (important washing machine tip below) The setup is still a little flakey (otherwise it would be 5 stars) but other than that I am very pleased. Tip for wash notification: the insight switch will send you a message when power STOPS being used (when the washer or whatever is finished). Initially it was sending notifications 4 times during the wash cycle as the washer changed cycles. In the app, under setup for the Insight switch, there is a setting for the on/standby threshold. Changing this from 8 watts (default) to 2 watts resolved the issue and now it only sends the notification when the load is completely finished. It took me a while to resolve that, but hopefully this will solve the issues for others.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I ended up purchasing this to turn on my Foscam camera when I leave a geo-fence via IFTTT and turn off my Foscam security camera when I approach home. The only thing I dislike about this is that from the mobile app, you cannot control devices that sit in two homes. I'd love to check the status of my devices in my SF home as well as in my LA home.

Ended up being that my phone was connecting to a different frequency from what the wemo switch needed. Once I temporarily shut off 5ghz frequency and forced my phone to connect to the 2.4 ghz, the switch connected like a dream. Now we use our echo to turn the lights off and it's quite a fun party trick. And even though I searched high and low on the internet for the above answer I couldn't find it.

Device is great - app is not so much,4.0 ,A bit difficult to set up even with the included hints and tricks with the instructions. My recommendation is to shut off mobile data as well as the other suggestions in the instructions to ensure proper and prompt configuration. I have not had any issues with the device disconnecting and I am able to control the light over any wifi or cell network. My only wish was that the app was better. The rule and away mode setup is cumbersome to say the least.

What a huge disappointment!,1.0 ,"I recently got an Amazon Echo, and I decided to try to use smart switches to jazz up the controls of the electronics that I use. I got the switch for my lights. The setup for of the Wemo switch was very easy for me. I was able to get it to connect to my wifi network with no issue. I also got Alexa to notice the smart home device and to add it. Also using the voice commands was no issue. The reason for the one star rating from me is two-fold. First, the switch only stays connected to wi-fi about two days at a time. After that, when you try to use Alexa to turn on the switch, it will tell you that the device is not responding. So you need to disconnect it and re-connect it to the outlet it is on. And again, this will work for about 2 days before you need to do it again. It does not matter if you reset it to factory default, it will do the same thing again. I contacted Belkin support about this and I told the representatives there that I reset to factory default about 10 times and the issue kept happening. I was told to try the same thing again, and also to try to do it with cellular data disabled on my cell phone. That would have no effect because you have to use wifi to set it up. I had both my cell phone and the switch on the same wifi network and it would still inexplicably lose connection. I got the TP-Link smart switch instead and I have had absolutely NO disconnects from the wifi network ever, and also no issue with Alexa. This switch does not work and then Belkin support is atrocious as far as honoring the warranty they are supposed to have on these devices. I am not sure what is happening to Belkin but their products and quality is slipping. I would not buy any of these switches again nor would I recommend it to anyone.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Frustratingly Successful!,4.0 ,"Ordered 2 to accompany my recently purchased Amazon Dot.

I couldn't tell whether the issue was with my internet service, my smartphone, the Dot or the switch itself. I can't even tell you how I accomplished the task. What is now clear, however, is that once connected, you still have to create a device account with Alexa. Since their successful activation, both have worked flawlessly!

Software is Poorly Thought Out,1.0 ,"If you own a drop cam you will appreciate this review. I originally purchased this device, because I wanted to be able to control drop cams connected to them, which sometimes go off line and need to be ""re-booted"". Herein lies the problem. If you are NOT on the original network which the WEMO was set up on, you cannot create a remote access to those devices. Totally unlike the software in the drop cam, that you create an account, and then ANYONE, regardless of the network they are on, can access those cameras with a password. This is not good BELKIN. This should have been better thought out. If you intend on using this device between two phones (say a couple for example) and you live in different parts (as we do), this WILL NOT WORK unless both phones were on the network (same network) in order to configure the devices.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Even though on the Wemo app it said the connection failed it actually didn't because when I closed the app and opened it again, it said ""connected"". For Echo users it's important to note your Echo will not detect the device until you set them up on your Wemo app first. (Even if you don't plan on using the Wemo app, you still have to download it and set it up.) Also, on their customer support page, there is a link that says ""Premium support"" that indicates for a fee you can talk to a person on the phone. What isn't apparent (unless you read the fine print) is that the first 90 days is free. So if you need help setting up the device, just give them a call. (800-223-5546) I would have gave this product five stars if the device came with a power regulator that would allow for you to control the brightness of the lamp that's being plugged into the device.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

They've definitely grown on me,4.0 ,"Update--after 9 months use, I'm adding two stars for two reasons. First, firmware update release notes tell me that Belkin is addressing concerns from Amazon reviews, especially in improving router SSID and password compatibility. Second, Echo and our WeMo switches work together perfectly, such that we only bother with the app to set timers. These are pretty nice, and certainly better than the two stars that I'd originally rated them. Original review--Now that we've got them set up, they're alright when we have 15 to 30 free seconds to launch an app and wait for it to connect to a couple of outlets five feet from the phone. Getting to this point required much patience and Googling, defaulting my router's SSID and password, and upgrading WEMO firmware a few times so that I'd be able to restore the router settings. . .

Worth the buy but beware the troubleshooting.,4.0 ,"First off I would like to say that the product presentation is nice. The cardboard really holds the switch in there. The original switch is a bit clunky but they have since improved that with the mini. Resetting this is also a bit awkward the instructions really should be in the app or printed on the back, so keep your manual handy or be prepared for a bit of internet troubleshooting. Setup for this thing is a bit of a pain but once you get the hang of it its not that hard. Functionality is good, and the switch syncs up well with Amazon Alexa, which is also a fairly time consuming processes. I've docked a star for setup and troubleshooting issues giving the app its own help tab could probably fix this. But I would still consider this a good product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"Works well; also supports scheduled events, but poorly documented. Scheduled events won't work if internet connection is lost.",4.0 ,"Works well. I installed and accepted the option to upgrade to the latest firmware version on 11/7/2015, and have been running it for almost 2 weeks now. You can access the device from anywhere using your iPhone, as long as you can connect to internet (via either Wifi or your cellular data plan). The device's connection to your home wifi is pretty stable and it auto-reconnects well in case it loses the connection. I had tried a similar device that became unusable as soon as it lost the Wifi connection one time, so this is important, because connections sometimes lapse for a few seconds, and you normally don't notice. You can set up ""rules"" to power on and off on a schedule. The schedule can be very specific: you can set each rule to run at a specific time and day or days of the week. You can edit and enable/disable the rules remotely. There is apparently no limit to the number of rules you can set up (I set up 5 with no limit in sight) Unfortunately, the rules WILL NOT RUN if the device loses its connection to the internet.

I gave this 2 stars for what this product can do. When it works, it's very cool. The IFTTT recipes are a nice way to expand functionality, and I was able to control the switch using both email and texts as well as from the app directly.

I can manually turn the sign back on at 10PM and it will automatically turn off at 1AM, thanks to a timer. The options are pretty much endless. And I can turn it off and on from my bed too, or anywhere that my phone has an internet connection.

I tried a competitor's product from D-Link - it was amazingly difficult to setup and we never succeeded so we returned it to Amazon. The WeMo by comparison was simple and setup worked the first time. Switch is in a garage location separated by very thick garage firewall but works fine on the wifi of a router 30 feet away and one floor above the garage.

When it works...,2.0 ,"This product is a good idea, but is VERY poorly supported by Belkin. App and firmware updates consistently break functions, which MIGHT be fixed in the next app or firmware update...at the expense of something else breaking. When they ARE working, they won't function with MAC filtering enabled on your wifi network (yes, even with the MAC addresses entered into the wireless router as exceptions). They have to be reset semi-weekly, as their internal clocks fall out of sync. They are only accessible through Android or iOS apps...no access from PC's. Belkin's support is quick to reply, but doesn't actually DO anything to fix problems, they just keep recommending uninstalling/reinstalling the app or completely resetting the Wemo switches...which doesn't actually do anything other than consume hours of time resetting everything only to have the exact same problems. My day job is as an IT administrator, and this poorly supported/designed technology frustrates ME. I can only imagine how much more frustrating Wemo must be for someone who doesn't live and breath troubleshooting network hardware. I'm beginning to wish I hadn't wasted the money on this product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"Overall, yeah I like it",4.0 ,"I really like this product but the only reason I give it four stars rather than five for two reasons: 1. it's very chunky so you can't use two in one outlet box so I have had to buy adapters, etc. I'm sure as the technology improves, like all things, these will get smaller. 2. The app is really annoying to me and a bit glitchy and is always prompting me to update its firmware or whatever. Now that I have the Echo, I just use her to control the switches so I never have to go on that crappy app again but for those without Echo, you will have to use the stupid app.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Does NOT work (reliably at least) with Amazon Echo,2.0 ,"If you're just looking for a switch to operate with an app on your smartphone, this product fills the bill nicely. However, if you're looking for a switch to interface with your Amazon Echo (Alexa), and operate with voice commands, this product does NOT fill the bill very well. I set everything up as instructed, and the switch worked flawlessly from the WeMo smartphone app, but when I gave Alexa commands to operate the device, 93% of the time I either got a message that the device could not be found, or a message that the device wasn't responding. 7% of the time, the command resulted in operation of the switch. I moved the switch to various locations throughout my home, with the exact same results.

DO NOT BUY!!!!,1.0 ,Worst thing I have ever gotten. I will never buy another Belkin product as long as I live. There customer service is not American based and it just makes things very difficult. They are not able to understand the real problem and how to fix it besides what their computer tells them. You are better off just searching google. The wemo switch lasted 2 months and then it finally stopped connecting to my wifi network. I bought 3 of them in December 2014 and all of them are already broken. The iPhone app is unbelievably buggy. Just look at the app stores rating. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this product. I just bought 3 Ankuoo Neo plugs and they are wonderful.

"Good switch, the mini is probably a better choice for most",4.0 ,"Works as advertised. Version two is much smaller. Down side to this one is that you can only put it in the top slot of a plug, otherwise it will cover the second slot. Also keep In mi d if you use this for a lamp, you have to get in the habit of turning the lamp off with the WeMo. My fience is constantly turning off the lamp normally so then the switch won't turn the light back on. And visa versa. We might have to switch lamps. Other downside is that sometimes it looses connection with the network. Seems to fix things once I launch the app. This is a bit annoying because it affects the Google home command, and the quick switch widget on my android phone. All in all it is great to be able to turn off items via internet. Even when I'm not home.

I use Wemo mostly for my exterior lighting solution and it works well once you set it and forget it.,4.0 ,"I've had the Wemo system for sometime now and feel it's overall a good product. Once it's setup, it does what I want it to do. I recently changed out my wi-fi routers and changed my SSID. Boy o boy did that take some time. There is really no easy way to just ""Update"" your wi-fi network settings with Wemo. I ended up having to reset all of my devices. What a pain in the neck. Then, to top it all off, my light switches needed a firmware update after in which, they needed to be reset once again. Bottom line.... I use Wemo mostly for my exterior lighting solution and it works well once you set it and forget it. Not sure about doing all of my interior lighting with this solution because it just seems like trouble at this point for me especially after going through the fiasco of my Wi-Fi changeover and all of my light switches having to be reset after the firmware update.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

""" Funny phrase written by a software developer trying to create ...",5.0 ,"This device now works well with Echo. It drove me bonkers trying to setup remote access in the WeMo app, so that it could then be detectable by Echo, and Amazon had no clue why. I would get this error: ""Sorry we were unable to setup your remote access just now. To try later, go to More > Remote Access."" Funny phrase written by a ""software developer"" trying to create an error message that has multiple uses, while trying to sound eloquent. Lol. It should say something like ""Your version of iOS is incompatible with Remote Access setup,"" since simply trying again by itself won't resolve the issue. Oh, and WeMo/Belkin was closed when I was doing this stuff. Anyway, I finally figured it out. As you can probably guess from my suggested error message change -- my version of iOS is incompatible. I am using a new beta version of the iPhone iOS, which doesn't allow the setup process to work properly with the WeMo app. You must have Remote Access enabled in order to make it discoverable by Echo. I ultimately used my iPad to set it up, and it worked perfectly. In fact, I thought I would have to enable remote access as a manual step, but once I was using a compatible version of iOS, it did that on its own as part of the automatic setup process. I then went back to Echo/Alexa and asked her to detect devices to setup, and she found them (finally). So if you're on any sort of beta iOS for the iPhone, either use a different device or go back to the regular, current iOS version. I think people might have the same problem using an old iOS version. The setup from the WeMo app was easy after that. And don't forget that WeMo switches only work on the 2.4 Ghz frequency (i didn't know that upon purchase, but got lucky and my Netgear modem/router combo was 2.4 compatible). You must also have UPnP enabled (enabled by default, but could be disabled by an installer or even you for security concerns). I guess if ANYBODY WANTS THE WEMO / ECHO SETUP to work guaranteed with no hassles, just buy a new 2.4 GHZ modem with it, which will have UPnP turned on by default, and use the correct iOS version. As long as you don't have any issues with signals being blocked at home, I'd imagine it would be pretty much plug and play.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
The switches are great; it's the app that needs work,4.0 ,"I have three switches that I use in a three story house. In order to have wifi on all three levels of the house we have a wireless router and two WAPs that extend the original signal from the router. It takes forever for the app to come up and allow me to access the switches. When I say forever, it would on many occasions be quicker for me to walk down two flights of stairs and turn the switch off manually and then get on with my day. Being able to check whether or not switches are on or off on the different levels of the house is really helpful. At the end of the day it would do me good to just walk down two flights of stairs and turn the switch off; however, I paid $50 for the switch to do that, so my expectations are a little frustrated by the really slow Wemo app.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Too pricy for what you get,3.0 ,"While a fun gimmick, they were a pain to connect, the software at install constantly crashes and the remote feature only works on 2 of the 4 switches I got as it says when I leave the house that the two are off line. They immediately work when I get back home on wifi. The reason I got them was to turn lights on and off while I am away remotely. If I leave and the remote shuts itself down... what's the point. However I did use these to set up timers around the house so when I wake up, the lights and appliances are waiting for me. Fun to play with at home / wifi. Useless and unreliable if you try the remote feature. I emailed support and got a form letter clearly written by a computer that didn't even address my concerns.

"Kept going offline, requiring a manual switch push to get it back.",3.0 ,"Meh. Not as great as I hoped based on reviews. I'm an IT guy so I have a certain expectation based on using a variety of tech based things over the years. App is a bit misleading and it took me a while to get things set up based on that. Things didn't work as seamlessly for me as they did for others. Eventually I was able to get things online and functioning and a firmware update came up and I installed it. When trying to set up a basic on-off event, it wasn't as intuitive as it should be. Once I had a couple basic on-off events set up, I used this for a week but I had to turn the unit back on manually with the power button and this was the deal breaker.

Good but issues after a power outage,4.0 ,"So far I like all the features of the switch but it has 1 flaw which is talked about by others. If there is a power outage, the switch comes back in an off state, regardless of what state it was on when the power went off. This is very annoying and they should instead provide a user selectable setting as to whether you want it to default to on, off, or whatever state it was in when the outage occurs. Until then, the workaround that I use it to create a lot of rules at 5 minute increments that turn it on. That way, I will only be out 4 minutes at the longest until it comes back on. I use it as a timer for an appliance and this works for me, but might not work for everyone if your switch is on for a very long period of time. I hope they fix this flaw in the design of the product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Seems to have been improved since release.,5.0 ,"A few things to keep in mind for my review: 1. I am primarily using these with Amazon Echo, which is a different experience than the app. 2. These seem to have been improved since release. When I was setting both of mine up, they both needed a firmware update, which took a couple of minutes. It looks like Belkin has improved the software powering these since they were released over 2 years ago. Some of the reviews here are a couple of years old so keep that in mind. 3. I am using these with a higher end router and I've taken steps to optimize my WiFi signal throughout my home. I would imagine you might have more issues if you're using these with a cheap or older router. Many lower end routers just aren't designed to maintain constant connections to numerous devices. I think this is why many smart home manufacturers use an additional hub, it eliminates putting so much on your router. Now, to the product itself. Setup was a breeze. Took just a couple of minutes per outlet including a firmware update. Plugged in my lamps, connected to my Amazon Echo and everything was good to go. Been using them for about 3 weeks and they work on the first try every time so far. Like I said, I'm using these with Echo. The app works OK as a remote and is sometimes more convenient than the Echo, but I don't know if it would be worth it without the Echo or other third party voice control hardware. I do wish the bottom had a smaller footprint as some plugs will not fit under the WeMo switch. I'll update this review if I encounter any problems.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Overall it is a good investment for anyone who wants to make a smart home.,3.0 ,"Easy to set up. Fast respond times from both the app and well suing my Echos or Tap. Set up was a bit tricky, but after a few times it work. I am giving it 3 stars becouse it was a bit tricking to set up and that i did have to redo the set up a few weeks after the first set up.

I love these things.,5.0 ,"I have two outlet type for lamps, plus one in-the-wall type controlling my porch light. These are so much better than those mechanical clockwork timers that have the little plastic things you pull out to set the on/off times. Setup on these is a little odd and hard to understand at first, but it works great and gives you a lot of flexibility in setting on/off programs.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Would not recommend,1.0 ,"Bought, tried to set it up on my home network using a Motorola SBG6850 router an an iPhone 6 running iOS 9.0.2 Wemo app would not find my main home network. Two extended phone calls with Belkin customer support failed to solve the problem. As this was my first smart device, I was really disappointed. Returned device to Amozon. Will go to a Wemo competitor that has a better track record. My compliments to Amazon for their return procedures. Very simple and efficient.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Frustrating setup - finally gave up and returned it,1.0 ,"The ""simple"" setup was so frustrating that I returned the WeMo switch for a refund. It refused to connect to my wifi network despite 4 hours of resetting, restoring factory defaults, and re-trying. Tried all of the online remedies from Belkin and other contributors. Product wifi must be inferior, even when right next to the router. Apparently there are many people who experienced the same frustration.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Good parental tool,5.0 ,I have this connected to my tv. I can schedule times when the tv will turn on. I can also turn off the tv when the kids are fighting over the remote.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Awesome.,4.0 ,"Works as advertised. I use it in conjunction with my Echo. It can be a pain to initially set up if you're not tech savvy since it may take a couple tries to get it up and running, but stays connected once it's set up. Also, the device itself is bulky and sticks out from the wall socket which could interfere with furniture lining up flush against walls. All in all, it's handy as hell and I'm pleased.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love my Wemo Switch,4.0 ,"I really like using my wemo switch with my Amazon Alexa. The switch is easy to install and set up using a smart phone. It can be used to set up rules for different switches such as turn lights plugged into it on and off at certain times, dusk and dawn settings, etc. You can also have remote access to any device plugged into the switch such as an iron or coffeemaker. A great little device for home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Easy to use and Easy setup,5.0 ,I purchased 2 of these timers for interior lights. It is so easy now the set the timers and change the times using the APP on my smartphone. I can use the APP to turn lights on or off from anywhere. When at home Amazon Alexa will turn the lights on or off with voice command. The smart plugs were very easy to install and set up. Connected to my WIFI with no issue.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Bad app but nice switch,3.0 ,"Purchased for Amazon Alexa Echo so I could control my portable heaters that I use when it's really cold. Works after a bit of playing around with the WeMo app. I'm not able to install a firm update at the moment , I push the button to update and it does nothing. The app really isnt very great hence the three stars but the switches seem to work perfect so far.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Works well, then becomes a source of unending frustration",1.0 ,"It was neat for a little while, when it worked. Then it stopped working and no amount of resets would revive it. Much too finicky to recommend to anyone. Definitely a failure when compared alongside our Echo or Hue bulbs.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Good Product, but not good for multiple locations.",3.0 ,"The product itself seems like a good product, but my issue is that I have two houses (1 in the states and 1 Mexico) the product will only work in one location, not multiple. I first set it up in my house in the US (worked great!) I then took more devices to the Mexico house and they wouldn't work, they kept trying to link themselves to the WIFI network to my house in the states, and there didn't appear to be a way to change that, the problem i'm sure is not with the device itself, it's a problem with their App. Note to Belkin please fix the App for use in multiple locations and WIFI Networks.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Easy Christmas lights with Alexa,5.0 ,"I bought this to use with the Echo for my Christmas tree. The plug is behind the tree and inaccessible. I plugged it in, set it up through the free WeMo app (which took maybe 10 minutes) and told Alexa to discover it. It has worked well and I have enjoyed speaking to turn the Christmas tree lights on and off instead of crawling all around the tree.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Has consistently performed,4.0 ,Not worth it. When I first got it it worked every night and I was delighted . Now it works just about every other day . I have physical limitations and depended upon this to use with my lamp . Sometimes it works . Sometimes it doesn't . Many a night I have found myself in the dark trying to make my way around because the light did not work It is about two months since my first review. Since then the device has been updated and it has consistently worked every night..,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
A great remote timer. Best purchase I made in 2014,5.0 ,Absolutely love this device. I use it for my cat feeder so i can trigger it remotely on a schedule using IFTTT or manually via the WEMO app on my phone. I found it initially tricky to update the firmware as it seemed to hang but second time round it worked (others have reported similar issues). I have used this now for 8 weeks and not lost network connectivity at all which is paramount. I will get more in the future for things like lights. Much better than a regular plug-in timer because I can both set it up in advance and make changes on the fly. One of the best purchases I made in 2014.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Nice idea if it worked,1.0 ,"I saw in the reviews that setting the switch up with your wifi connection could be tricky, but I figured that I could probably figure it out. I bought it to use with 2 lamps while I was going to be away. They were problematic from the moment I plugged them in. I could easily identify the switch on the Belkin network, but when it tried to connect to my own wifi, it was only intermittently successful. I tried for 3 days - the first night I spent 2 hours. I tried Belkin's FAQ and customer support, and was still unsuccessful. The second day, after a good night's sleep, I thought I would try it again. This time, for no discernable reason, it was successful! It seemed to be operating correctly, but stated I needed a firmware update. I downloaded the firmware update, and then it could no longer find my wifi, and I was back to step 1. I tried the rest of the day, and again the next day, but could never get it to find my wifi again no matter what I did. I ended up returning them to Amazon.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love these things,5.0 ,"Love these things. Keep buying more and more. Syncs up great with alexa so I've got a nice home automation system setup now. It even lets you set schedules (I.E. at 11:50PM the lights automatically turn off, at 10:00AM they automatically turn on). Also love how I can use voice to command them since I have an Amazon Dot. Great product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great switches for a connected home,4.0 ,"I bought this wi-fi outlet switch to connect with my amazon echo. It is used to control lamps, heaters, christmas lights ect. Setup was easier than i anticipated and they work flawlessly. A simple verbal command to Alexa (amazon echo) will turn of,f or on, any appliance that is plugged into the outlet. An added benefit is that with the Wemo app on my phone I can control these switches from anywhere that has a wi-fi connection. Shipment was prompt and packaging was excellent. I would and probably will buy more of these Wi-fi switches.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
When the power goes off you have to reset the dumb thing??,1.0 ,"Came back home to a non functioning unit... apparently power had been off prior to my arrival. After research a learned they they don't do so well after power losses. Ain't nobody got time for that! Recommend looking at tp-link instead, cheaper and more reliable.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Buyer beware...,1.0 ,"I have purchased 3 of the Smart Plugs and they just flat fail in the reliability catagory. They are not reliable. They do work with Alexa (sometimes) and sometimes they do not. They are on the network (sometimes) and other times they just drop off. I highly recommend that you do NOT purchase this item. Belkin needs to pull them off the market until they have corrected the product and Amazon should not sell this item until such time as Belkin does so, BTW I would not feel bad about sending all of them in for a refund. I never, ever write reviews but these are so frustrating that I must make this review.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Real time saver and convenient,5.0 ,"I have two of these now, one for my Christmas Tree lights and one for an unswitched outlet that is difficult to get to. Now I can control those outlets from the convenience of my Android phone or tablet. One thing to note, though, is that the official Belkin app for controlling these devices is truly dreadful and I had a terrible time getting the app to connect to the devices. Fortunately, a third party developer (MikeP) wrote an app called WeMo Manager that works much, much better. I think Belkin spent too much time making their app look pretty and forgot that its first duty is to work. WeMo Manager might not look so pretty, but it reliably locates and controls the devices.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Name it, tell Alexa to turn it on, never look back",5.0 ,"Works wonderfully, I use this as a light switch (since it's cheaper than the WiFi bulbs) and I named it Castiel (thinking it might be hard for it to recognize) it works well. I walk into my place and tell Alexa (Amazon Echo) to turn on Castiel and it turns on (sometimes a slight delay but it turns on eventually). Cannot recommend it enough for easy use when sleeping and such.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great automation solution. Works reliably. Great convenience and peace of mind.,5.0 ,I have 5 of these switches now. They're quite handy for checking whether or not you left something on while you're not at home. I also really like the randomized away timers that the app has built in. We've used them around the house for going on vacation. Setup is about as easy as connecting to a new bluetooth speaker or other accessory.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Alexa, WeMos, :-)",5.0 ,"Worked fairly easy with some interpretive skills. I use TP-Links and Wemo in my home and successfully on my Alexa network. Very intraoperative! Using Alexa groups I can ask for a room to turn off (e.g., Alexa, turn the basement off) or I can address the specific switch/device by name (e.g., Alexa, turn the basement lamp off).","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Setup Issues Not Worth It,2.0 ,"I purchased two if these to use with my Echo. I'm not super techy but I can generally figure most things out with some research. The intial setup was a real pain (android, Galaxy 7). Finally figured it out and got both plugs working with my Echo. Month's later I moved. I have tried setting up again numerous times quitting in frustration each time after having tried many suggestions on forums without success. Today one user mentioned changing the DHCP range setting... whatever that is. I give up. These are supposed to make life convenient and easy. Do your research and find something without documented setup issues.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"for the smart, and the lazy too",5.0 ,"Only reason I got this was so I can say ""Alexa turn on my light"", and she connects with WeMo outlet here and turns on my light saying ""okay"", and well yeah, that's all I've used it for ever, and it has never failed me, turns my light on and off, as much as I want, whenever I want. Anything to make things easy, right? Forget flipping switches, just tell your automation-robot to turn stuff on and off FOR you. Lazy and I love it - but also smart. Yeah, smart and lazy.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works well with Echo.,5.0 ,"This works well, with my Amazon echo to turn on the bedroom light across the room that I usually do not walk across the room to turn on. It is the last thing I do once I am tucked away in bed and I am delighted every time I do it that I am not tripping across a darkened room to find my bed. I am an older person and recommend this in conjunction with an echo.

Very useful gadgets,5.0 ,"I had used timers for several lamps to make the house look occupied while traveling. But I purchased these smart plugs to replace all of them.

In addition, you can use your smart phone app to turn them on or off at any time when you are away.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Echo loves WeMo...,4.0 ,"My Echo is so cool when coupled with the WeMo switches. Just pick your switch and tell Alexa to turn it on or off. Gonna have another one coupled to the Dot and tell Alexa to switch on a powered amp next to Dot. Just why are these so expensive? I think the price point should be around $20, not the $40 these cost!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Easy to set up and use,4.0 ,"This switch is easy to set up on the WeMo app and very easy to use to set rules, etc. It has already proven to be very useful- turning on lights before I got home late one night. I took away one star because the unit is a little bulky and almost covers both plugs in a standard outlet. It would be nice if the bottom didn't curve down so much so that another plug could be used easily in the same outlet.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Extremely maddening to get this to work. To this day, I have no idea how I got one of them to work.",2.0 ,"Extremely maddening to get this to work. To this day, I have no idea how I got one of them to work. I am fearful of pulling it out of the wall now. It does work as described, you can set rules, but again setting it up was a pain. One worked flawlessly regarding connecting to the wireless network. The other one, I don't know what I did differently or what, but it couldn't connect and when it did, it didn't allow me to set rules. Set up = FAIL. This is a common theme in the reviews. I would not purchase any more of these units again.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Convenient once set up, but Samsung users beware...",4.0 ,"This switch works pretty well once you get it set up, but as others have noted, it has some issues. I was unable to set up the network connection for the device using either a Samsung Note 3 or the Samsung Galaxy S5. Fortunately, I was able to use my non-Samsung tablet to configure the switch for my network. Once that was done, I was able to use both Samsung devices to control the switch thereafter. It's a bit weird, but worth noting, as it may drive some other poor Samsung owner mad while they continually fail to set up the device. Once the switch is joined to your wifi network, it works pretty well. My router is on the 3rd floor of my house, and I have switches on the 2nd and 1st floor. The switch on the 1st floor seems to drop the network connection on occasion, which can be quite annoying, but it isn't entirely unexpected. The app is simple to use, and it offers IFTTT integration, although I haven't tried it yet. Overall, I recommend this device, although I'd feel better about it if it were $30-35.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Let's restart again.,2.0 ,Kind of worked maybe but at this point I don't remember at time when I didn't have to unplug the unit from a wall and do a full restart at least once a week. I also have a Phillips Hue system and I never have to restart those. I have to restart these all the time. They constantly show not connected and won't work with the Amazon Echo until you reset them.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Nice Devices,5.0 ,"I wrote a review earlier on the mini product page, not knowing it was not for this model. All I can say is I love this device along with the wall switch. These work well with my mesh network. I didn't like the information given for programming, but I did figure it out. I bought these because I travel so much. If you like ability to re-scheduling/changing on and off times for your lights, then these will do the trick. So far they have worked flawlessly. They look great too. I'm going to add a couple of mini plugs soon, before my next trip. Congratulations Belken, these are winners and should make any household a little more secure.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love - but wish we could use more of these,4.0 ,"This was very easy to set up and use. We originally got it for our Keurig, but it won't work on it. The Keurig has an off/on switch, and the wemo switch needs to be plugged into something that can turn off and on just by the plug. if you plug in the keurig it doesn't turn, so this switch won't turn it on. We moved it to the Christmas tree. It now controls the lights. Which is great! I never liked crawling under the tree anyways. We can set a timer for it while we are away. This has been great. When Christmas is over we will probably move it to a lamp. I like that you don't have to use your device to turn it off and on, it has a button on the switch that turns it off and on as well.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Excellent Product,5.0 ,I now have 4 of them and have given two of my friends one each and we all LOVE them. What a handy thing to control lights when you are home and when you are away.

The lights go on and off just like magic.,5.0 ,"It's so much fun to tell Alexa to turn the lights on and off. This switch works really well. I just enter a room and ask Alexa to turn on the light. You name the light when you install it, so we call the bedroom light ""bedroom"" (not very creative, I know). So we say ""Alexa, turn on the bedroom light"" and voila, it goes on. It's so much fun.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great product to automate your home without monthly fees.,4.0 ,Very helpful with turning things on and off in the house. I currently use this to turn on lights in the living room. I have it preset to turn on when it gets dark. It's nice to come home to a well lit house. Only gave it 4 stars because it requires software updates very frequently. Can be annoying at times.

Great peace of mind.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love it.,5.0 ,"I purchased two of these for lamps in 2 rooms of the house. Not only can I control them remotely away from home with the app on my iphone, but I can also set up different off and on times that will repeat daily. I have them set up to come on at 4:30 pm. No more coming home to a dark house if I go somewhere after work. Also, if I go on vacation, I'll set them to go on and off randomly throughout the night. They were very easy to set up the first time. But then I had to change out my wireless router and had to reprogram them again. I don't know why, but the second time was much more difficult to get the units to recognize and link to my router, but I finally got it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Consistently great working device as advertised,4.0 ,"Consistently great working device as advertised. IFTTT interfaces with it flawlessly, so does Amazon Echo. I grouped three of them on Echo and called them Christmas lights, so I could tell Echo ""Alexa, turn on the Christmas lights"". Visitors thing that's cool. Also I made a program with my free IFTTT account that says always turn off this particular lamp at 10:30pm. Affordable, works great. I use mine with an iPhone. OH! you can address it from anywhere.

They are great for turning on and off our lights in the evening automatically. We plan to use them when we travel to keep the house safer.

Great for automated control,3.0 ,"The good: I use this along with IFTTT to turn my lights on and off automatically in response to text messages when I am on vacation. The WeMo app is nice, but you need the free IFTTT app as well to get the full benefit of this switch. The bad: This device uses pigtails instead of screw terminals. This results in extra wire and extra wire nuts which crowd the electrical box. This switch would get 5 stars if it came with screw terminals. I would give it bonus points if it came with professional grade back wired screw clamp terminals.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Vast improvement on the outlet timers. Definitely makes me want to look more into an integrated smart home.,5.0 ,"This is a vast improvement over the old mechanical, and even some digital, outlet timers. Its much easier to set schedules, and can even be done remotely. I plan to buy a few more of these to automate a few devices in my home. There is a novelty factor that makes me want to buy some for things I don't really need it on.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Pretty awesome,5.0 ,These work as stated. I had to reset my router after a few failed attempts to connect but once I did that they connected instantly.

Worked for awhile.,1.0 ,"3 times taller than most adapters, worked until I got a newer Wi-Fi router. Now I can't get a signal from the Wemo. One time I did it wouldn't stay connected.

Perfect. That's all I wanted in the first place,4.0 ,"I bought the WeMo switch and installed it to switch my TV soundbar on and off, as a way to mute the TV with a voice command on my Amazon Echo. When I first set it up, it took two tries just to get it on the network correctly. I use an Apple router for my wifi. Once set-up it worked equally the same from either 1) iPhone6 2) iPad Mini or 3) Amazon Echo. By equal, I mean that once you got the WeMo's attention it reliably turned the switch on and off from any device. I ran it that way for a few hours. If you didn't send a command to the WeMo for 20 minutes or so, the WeMo seemed to go into a sleep mode and it took several tries to wake it up before it would finally accept a command again. NOT OK! I did the firmware update, that it notified me was available and now it doesn't go into sleep mode, anymore. Whenever I command it ""turn TV on"", ""turn TV off"", it responds the first time from the Echo. Perfect. That's all I wanted in the first place. On the downside, now the iPhone can't talk to it at all but the iPad can and it responds the first time, every time on the iPad, also. I give it four stars because it accomplished my mission - to mute the TV from the Echo. Buggy? You bet. Either Amazon or Apple needs to make something like this, themselves.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Installed and configured within a few minutes, almost seamlessly",5.0 ,"It does exactly what it supposed to, turns power on and off remotely. My concern was with setting it up and connecting it to the wifi network. I returned a similar product, Raynic wireless switch, because I could not reliably connect it. This one connected easily, after I realized that the mobile device, on which WeMo app is installed, must be connected to the WeMo wifi network (NOT YOUR HOME WIFI). There is no instruction booklet, only a small quick setup card, so it wasn't clear to me that I had to switch to NeMo wifi. If I could, I would give this 4.5 stars, but if this is not an option, 5 stars it is. I should note that I only connected it today, so, I can't offer an opinion on how this device is during a long term use. I can only review installation and configuration","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works Great with Echo Dot,5.0 ,"We purchased two switches to run bedroom lights and a box fan through an Echo Dot. The switch is easy to set up and use.

Wemo wall outlets work well,4.0 ,"I previously purchased 2 Wemo outlets a few years ago and needed to purchase two more. I had the original switches installed on my Smartphone. The installation of the new switches took a few attempts, but finally got them loaded to my phone. However, the first two switches got wiped out on my phone's Wemo app. The first two switches are at another house. So, I will need to re-add them to the Wemo app. I also have them connected to an Amazon Echo Dot unit. So, I can tell Alexa to turn the lights on and off. I would recommend these switches, as well as the wall switches.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"App crashes and hangs a lot, never did get switch to work in 4 hours of trying",1.0 ,"I am a programmer and an internet professional, not a newbie. Two of us engineers tried for four hours to get it working, without success. Factory reset the switch 5 or 6 times, tried both iOS and Android apps, tried every conceivable path. Apps crashed a lot, hung repeatedly, did not sync up names without rebooting the switch, lots and LOTS of problems, and in the end, although the switch appeared to connect to the cloud successfully, it never did work, had ""DeviceID: (null)"" and never was able to do the one thing it supposedly does: turn the outlet ON or OFF!! I sent a detailed ""Problem Report"" to the Belkin support team (with the app) and have not heard back from them, 24 hours later. My setup is a straightforward Comcast internet connection with nothing out of the ordinary. Plugged in the switch and followed all the instructions. Very frustrating.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Look Ma, NO HANDS!",5.0 ,"This addition to my home is awesome! I just walk into one of the rooms and are able to turn the lights off or on with a simple voice command. I am very surprised on how simple it was to set up to connect to my home wifi. If I am out of town or away from home I can turn my lights on or off with my phone, or I can set the timer with my phone as well. The Wemo timer is a lot simpler to configure than the traditional timer","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
WeMo Switch with Amazon Echo (NOT for the Switch alone),5.0 ,"As the title indicates, this review and rating apply ONLY to the combination of an Echo and a WeMo Switch. Personally, I would not recommend the WeMo Switch by itself. I got my first Switch as a gift, and I frankly thought it was a poor product concept - after all, what kind of poor schmuck is too lazy to turn off a light switch? Um...er... I guess that would be me. It's worth noting that roughly 6 years ago, I had zero interest in ever buying a kindle as I didn't think it could ever stack up against the experience of reading a well made hard cover. After trying the kindle once, I now rarely buy physical books except professional texts. First, let me explain my set up. I have an Echo resting on my admittedly 1970's style bookcase headboard in my bedroom and a lamp on top of a bureau across the room. I usually end my day listening to music on the Echo while reading a book on my Kindle, or watching a television episode on my iPad using the Echo as a substitute speaker for the lousy built-ins. Having received what I thought was a silly gift I would never use, I left it in the box for a couple of weeks before getting off my butt and hooking it up to the lamp. After setting up the Switch and connecting it to the Echo (more on setup issues below), I simply said ""Alexa, please turn off the lamp"", and the lamp turned off. Let me preface this with the statement that I used to think I was a fairly bright person, however, the next 5 minutes after completing the setup convinced me that my inner child is a total idiot. Finding yourself repeatedly saying ""Alexa, please turn off the lamp"", ""Alexa, please turn on the lamp"" while giggling is not a strong vote for one possessing a mature mind. I have found one use for this silly thing that I truly enjoy. As I get drowsy reading a book, rather than get out a warm comfy bed to turn things off, I simply whisper ""Alexa, please turn off the lamp"". Instant darkness and silence without having to wake yourself back up by trudging across the room. For the second one in the living room/ man cave, I can turn activate it using a normal conversational voice volume from 25' or circa 7.5M away. The major downside is that the setup via the iOS app is buggy, the directions grossly insufficient, and the user interface provides false negatives throughout the set up process. By ""false negatives"" I mean that the app indicates that your set up is failing when in fact it has succeeded. The trick is simple - switch back and forth between the WeMo app and the iOS settings app and it suddenly shows up as being fully connected. To sync to the Echo, you must first press the tiny button on top of the unit, and then say ""Alexa, detect my WeMo Switch"" and you are done. I would give the app by itself 1 star. On the safety side of things, even though it's rated for 1800W, I would question the wisdom of ever going over 500 watts - a single light or two is fine, but space heaters or high end entertainment systems? Not for this product - I think WeMo was, kindly stated, aggressive in their specing this at 1800W. This opinion is based on simple prejudice regarding lightweight electronics and is not the result of any benchmarking or other testing - I reserve the right to be completely wrong. The only other downside is that your friends will react by saying things like ""don't you have ANYTHING better to do with your money?"", the more straight forward ""you are an idiot"", and the occasional ""I'm not sure if that is awesome or just plain creepy"". My recommended response is to grin and send them one as a gift, but only if they already own an Echo. I hope you find this review to be helpful. I'll update this post if the units fail.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Automate your home electronics,5.0 ,"I use the WeMo to have lights in my apartment go on a few minutes before my alarm goes off in the morning and shut off after I leave, making one less thing to think about in the morning, which is priceless. With some creative rulemaking you can really put your home lighting scheme on autopilot. I use only LED lights so electricity waste and heat generated are minimal. Super easy set up. I found there are occasional headaches with it losing the internet connection, requiring a re-pairing with the router or a restart of the iPhone app. I chalk this up to weakness of my home internet and not the WeMo switch. Great first-gen product, I look forward to seeing other home automation products from Belkin.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Junk!,1.0 ,"I bought two of these, neither of them worked out of the box. The app is buggy, and timed out when trying to join my WIFI network, changing routers didn't help. Trying to reset them with the reset button left one not broadcasting a WIFI network at all, and the other one broadcasting a network that could not be joined. At no point could I get these to join my network or perform the very basic function of turning a light on or off. This is just a poorly designed product, and a total waste of time. Save yourself the trouble and frustration.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Connecting lamps and appliances to my Echo Dots with these plugs a snap!,5.0 ,"I used these plugs to add my arrangement of living room lamps to an Alexa control group so I could simply say ""Alexa, Living Room On"" and have all the lights turn on without walking to each lamp manually and switching them on.

Muwahahaha!,5.0 ,"I use two of these to control my kid's wifi routers from anywhere on Earth! I use it to: compel homework doing, summon for dinner, getting them to pop their heads out of their rooms, and instant and terrible punishment! The programmable on/off feature makes sure the routers go down early on school nights. Locating the switch can be tricky if the switch is upstairs and the controlling wifi router is downstairs - you many need to experiment so there is good coverage.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Makes it all easier,5.0 ,"oh hell yeah! I plugged in a surge protector, which houses the my a nice chunk of my studio. What used to take 8 switches to turn on/off is now one Alexa command. This is a no-brainer. They have another, which keeps track of usage etc in the app. It could be fun if you're into that kind of thing. I should also mention that setup was super easy.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

like every other lamp does,1.0 ,"I have 2 of these and now after less than a year, neither one works. I had a third that never was able to connect to wifi, so i returned it. i wish I had returned these as well. they work 1 out of 5 times with Amazon echo, usually they just disconnect. the app has problems bringing them up. when they do work they are slow. I usually have to power cycle them once a week to get them to come back up. about the only thing they do is turn on and off when I press the power button on them...like every other lamp does!! kinda defeats the purpose of being a ""smart plug"" if I have to manually intervene. My suggestion? get something else. I recently replaced both of mine with TP-Link and they work great. your mileage may vary, but Belkin has a long way to go with these.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

No customer service by Belkin - Avoid this and all products they make,1.0 ,"UPDATE: Is there a way to give it no stars!?!? They finally reply - 5 emails back and forth asking inane questions. Then a phone call to set up a specific ""level 2"" call back. They call 30 minutes late from an offshore calling center. She spends 3 minutes telling me who I am, telling me who she is and telling me we are talking on a telephone. Then 5 minutes asking me to reply to all of the questions I already answered in email to confirm my answers since obviously since this afternoon Apple released a new iOs ONLY to me and I installed it in my phone or perhaps I sold my iPhone, bought a Droid and reprogrammed it all! I ask for a supervisor as the only support she offers is to factory reset my Echo since Belkin's could never make a defective product. I refuse and ask for a Supervisor. 3 mins later I get a supervisor who tells me all the things the are doing for me. I ask multiple times to be transferred to the USA and they refuse. I very loudly point out that all they have done for last week is tell me what they are going to do and that they have actually done nothing. I also tell her that doing a factory reset is akin to blowing up your car because it has a dirty window. I then get put on hold for 5 more minutes for her to talk to a technician. She comes back and tells me we need to do a 3-way call with Amazon but they can't find the # so could I provide it. At which point I tell her, I am done, I quit, I surrender! Since this is programmed to my phone and I spent all the time setting up the on and off features I am keeping it until after Christmas at which time it will be thrown in the trash. I will NEVER buy Belkin again and strongly suggest you heed this warning. Defective products combined with horrible offshore customer service. In a week they have done absolutely nothing but agitate me and waste time I will never get back in my life. Original Review Review based on the absolute and complete lack of response by their customer service. I bought this because it was sold as a product that integrates with the Amazon echo. After numerous attempts I found it did no such thing and sought support. Their support consists of an email address and A promise to call you to help you. Clearly when my phone doesn't ring I know that it's Belkin calling. Other functions were very easy to set up although I did have some difficulty with the firmware update. If I use my iPhone the control works as expected but my true intent was to have this integrate with my echo which it does not. Sadly it seems Belkin has no interest in helping me with this. As my Christmas tree is plugged into it right now will keep it but not happily.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

No spaces in WPA passwords?!?!,1.0 ,1. App setup is terrible - you have to manually kill the app for it to recognize the change in wifi settings. It does not tell you this. 2. Does not support spaces in WPA passkeys (i.e. your WiFi password). This is unacceptable in 2014 - as far as I'm concerned that means it does not meet the WPA/WiFi spec and should be considered to be falsely advertising that it does. 3.

It's also if I'm coming home later than normal, I can turn on a few lights in the home while I'm all about so it's not completely dark upon arrival.

Firmware Update,4.0 ,"I've purchased two of these and both have required a firmware update right out of the box. Those take a long time and do not let you know the status of the update as it is occurring. Once those are complete, the product is fantastic and the rules are game changers at my house!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Control of my lights are great on this,5.0 ,"Control of my lights are great on this. application is nice. Wemo had a nicer program to turn on and off lights. Others I tried were not as good. For example, you can set them to come on at dusk and go off at a certain time (same as dawn - on at a time and off at dusk). Another competitor you can only have on for a certain amount of time (i.e. up to 3 hrs and 59 minutes).","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
The App is so bad the actual product is unusable.,1.0 ,"Garbage. You have to use an app, which is TERRIBLE. Doesn't work, instructions don't match reality, would only see one of my access points and could never get it to connect. The first time I tried to enter the password, I blindly typed it and clicked next, it took several minutes before I could actually reenter the password, that's when I noticed that it was auto capitalizing the first letter, I guess their andorid developers never heard of inputType... Bad bad bad.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
An absolute waste,2.0 ,"Junk. Had to swap the original. Finally got one that worked, but, after less than a year, it no longer appears in the wemo app. It was still working until this morning, where it was responsive to IFTTT. That is no longer the case. Only working from push button. An absolute waste","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Youtube provided better instructions, othwerwise, works as expected!",5.0 ,"Easy to set up, and works as two separate signals and one more network in my house. Not as easy to duplicate my signal/password as I thought, but the instructions were easier to find on Youtube. Duplication instructions, if in the manual, were not easy to figure out or understand.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Reasonable sale price makes it great replacement for old fashioned timers,5.0 ,"Replaced an old fashioned timer that was getting a little slow and loud. For the sale price, it wasn't that much more than a plain timer. You can do lot of cool programming tricks like set an on-off schedule and a snooze schedule so if you need the turn the light on in the middle of the night you can have it snooze abd turn itself off after a few minutes.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Perfect Smart Plug!,5.0 ,Perfect Smart Plug! I got the Echo Dot for Christmas so I got this to pair with it and plug my lamp into it. I LOVE IT!!!!

Plus I LOVE BELKIN!!,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Amazing product,5.0 ,"This was my first endeavor into the ""smart house"" products. The set up was incredibly easy, the app is easy to use and it is compatible with Alexa. I can set timers for my lamp while I'm not at home and I can switch it on and off from anywhere. I liked it so much, I've already ordered two more!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Okay at home maybe not so much for vacation,3.0 ,Set up went pretty smooth. I like the fact I can rename and lable the plugs. Constantly have a problem with one of my plugs going undetected and failing. Then having trouble with the app getting it to detect the device again without having to unplug it from the wall then re-plug it back in. Okay for home/ everyday use with timer and seasonal lights. Am weary about its use while on holiday and the possibility of the device going undetected then not being able to control it remotely as well as lights not turning on as programmed. Have sent multiple 'feedback ' to the company about the problem and it still continues..,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Quick and easy install,5.0 ,"I ordered the wemo when I read that it was compatible with nest. The installation and set up so very simple. We are using the schedule feature now, so we have not tried to use the switch with the nest yet. I was so happy with the first switch that I ordered two more and am looking at the light switch for my outside lights!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Configuration is a pain,2.0 ,"This is my third wemo device and I have to say the configuration experience is really bad. It was really easy when you set up the first one, but their app becomes really buggy when you want to set up the second or third one. Keep saying my WIFI passowrd is wrong which is not possible. I don't understand why a company like Belkin can not fix this kind of issue.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works Great with android phone (wemo app),3.0 ,"The plug is ok, but the ios app sucks it doesn't recognize my plug most of the times,if it does takes a longer time.

I like it with my android phone.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great Tool for the Home,4.0 ,I love the WeMo devices. I use the Alexa app through my Echo and Echo Dot and these items have not let me down. For programming the app is a little clumsy but I could work through.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Rocky start, but ultimately a great device",4.0 ,"It took a little while to figure out. I even had to call support (India based) to get it working properly. Support was very helpful in getting it to work, and even stay a little while longer to verify things were working properly once it was set up. Overall, very happy with this purchase. Can't wait til summer when I can turn on my ac remotely before I even get home. Bonus: works with https://ifttt.com/ for even more custom fun!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Difficult to get on network,3.0 ,"After at least 8 attempts to get the switch recognized it finally connected. The app is wonky, and requires you to switch back and forth from your home wifi and the Weemo network. Connecting shouldn't be this time consuming. Using it with my Echo and it works great.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Stay clear of this !,1.0 ,"I have many of these and they all work great EXCEPT this one. From day one it makes a high pitch noise when plugged in. I gather it is one of the capacitors inside. I would recommend getting it from somewhere else, or Wemo has a small profile plug. Get that.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
... that was not connected to a switch into a smart lamp. Works like a charm,5.0 ,"Paired this with a lamp and an Alexa Echo to turn a wall outlet that was not connected to a switch into a smart lamp. Works like a charm. Note it does have a ground (3-prongs) so plan where it will go accordingly. Comes with an app to control the switch from outside the home, but best use case is pairing with a smart device like Alexa.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Good purchase!,5.0 ,"Very easy to setup and works just as it should. Using this currently to control our exterior landscape lighting which notoriously did not work properly with the regular photo eye. This allows us to schedule with sundown and sunset (with offsets by 15, 30, 45 minutes as needed). No issues at all with the setup, and seems to be working perfectly.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Don't buy,1.0 ,"Product is discontinued for a reason. Item never connected to my network. Tried to make item work for two days & no success.

Stay away from it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
WeMo Switch does my light for over a year,4.0 ,"I have WeMo Switch now over a year and works very well. It was easy to setup. I use it for a floor lamp in the living room. The automatic timer works very well too. In Winter I automatically setup a time when more or less I arrive and had light. But with the iOs app, it was easy to turn it on or off, even if not connected to wireless. Never had a problem over a year. I just hoped that within a year Belkin would also adapt Siri but they didn't. So my next switch maybe Elegato Eve that is in the same price range and supports Sir but does even more.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
it is a completely useless piece of plastic,1.0 ,"This device is controlled through an app (iOS and/or Android). Without the app, it is a completely useless piece of plastic. I have an Android device but the app will not even install. I've spent 2 hours on the phone with Tech Support and they have no idea about what is going on. I will return the item to Amazon. I wish other manufacturers made something similar as Belkin is clearly not up to speed.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Five Stars,5.0 ,"Works Great bought 2 more.I am having a bit of a problem with second one, my wifi in that area is not very strong ,but it still works with minor interruptions, All in All they are very good,just make sure you have good wifi. It would also help if unit had a wifi LED so you would know when it is or is not connected.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Amazing Outlets.,4.0 ,"I have 6 of these devices which are fantastic. They have been updating the iOS app regularly with new features and updates to the functionality (when they first came out the App was a little buggy in my experience and I had trouble communicating with the devices when on cellular data- away from my house). But with the free updates, these are rock solid. I love that these help me save money and can help as a safety measure if I accidentally leave something on when I leave the house. I feel that they are a little steep (being $50 an item- I'd buy even more if they were a little cheaper). I look forward to seeing what else Wemo can do in the future!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Basically a piece of nicely packaged junk,1.0 ,"If I could give it less than a star, I would. Not able to connect to WiFi.

Not recommended.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"It has great potential, but the app is complete garbage",1.0 ,"You will cry yourself to sleep when you realize how pitiful this product is. It has great potential, but the app is complete garbage. Currently, the app won't even see my four switches despite a factory rest of both the phone and switches. Fortunately, they are still linked to IFTTT for control. I just can't toggle them manually.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Unreliable,1.0 ,"Have gone through several ""firmware updates"" over the past year and after each the ability to communicate and control the Wemo switch suffered to the point that I have removed them from use. They are so unreliable that I would never recommend these to anyone.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"These units are just wonderful and pair readily with Alexa but also work perfectly with the WEMO app, too!",5.0 ,"I absolutely love this item! It paired readily with my Amazo Echo and Amazon Echo Dot, and also works with the WEMO app on my iPhone and iPad if I wish to use the timer features available on those apps. I could not be happier. It makes the operation of lights that previously made me reach over furniture to operate a breeze to use now!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Major Unresolved Bug,1.0 ,"Major bug since last update. After many tweets, calls and emails Belkin finally agrees there is major bug. But bug resolution is unknown. For now these will turn on at all hours of the night when using certain timer settings. Don't buy, use, or even add lights to these plugs if you don't want to be woken up in the middle of the night.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

... this for an attic fan that I made to cool off the entire house,5.0 ,"I use this for an attic fan that I made to cool off the entire house. I can turn it on and off from the couch. The app lets you put rules on the device - like, turn off after 4 hours, or turn on during the weekends and off at night, etc. You control how those are set. I wish you could set multiple on the device - but they may change that eventually as it's only a software change in the app.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
They tie in so easily with Alexa so I can turn on my lamp ...,5.0 ,"I have WeMo plugs on lamps with timers enabled, on my bedroom lamp, and most importantly in my bathroom where I plug in my hot iron. They tie in so easily with Alexa so I can turn on my lamp as I walk to my bed after turning out the lights. The app on my iPhone comes in so handy when I fear I left on my hot iron and can at least turn off the switch if it's on. Really like these.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
absolutely love the features of the wemo switch,5.0 ,absolutely love the features of the wemo switch. I mainly bought this to control stuff with my iPhone but also will begin using it to set timers for holiday decorations rather than turning them all on and off every night during the holiday season. Would highly recommend. Planning on buying more as well!,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Scheduling function is fantastic...,5.0 ,"I always sleep with a fan on because otherwise I am too warm when I go to sleep. However when I wake up, I find it difficult to get out of bed during the week cause I wake up and it is too cold. With the Wemo switch I set a schedule so my fan turns off 30 minutes before my normal wake up time, and I wake up to a comfortable room temperature! No more using ""it's too cold"" as an excuse to hit the snooze button.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Good start to home automation,4.0 ,"Love the WeMo switch lineup but I wish they were a little more compact. They also seem to be updated quite often so if I am out of the house connections can be an issue. Overall I use this everyday to turn on and off a fan in our room where we sleep. Once in awhile I will use to start a crock-pot while we are at work. Hopefully the design and functionality will continue to evolve, this is just the start.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I have an Android so I had to do a few little extra steps with the App but no big deal and the how tos walk you through it.

Fun addition to the Amazon Echo.,5.0 ,"What do you get the husband who has everything? This gadget for his Echo. He plugged the fan into it and says ""Alexa, fan on"".

Works as described,5.0 ,Great ability to customize what it is used for. You can not only rename but can also take a pic so you can easily identify which one you are turning on/off. It has great features as far as timer setting and such. My only slightly con to this product is that wify setting was a bit confusing. But I do love it.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Very Frustrating.,2.0 ,"I never write reviews but this product warrants negative feedback. I purchased this product so I could remotely reset my home router and another electronic security device. The first one I purchased worked properly on both my backup 3G hotspot home network and also remotely. I bought a 2nd one and it did not work remotely. I bought a 3rd one and it did not work remotely either. I spent hours testing, retesting, resetting to factory defaults, uninstalling apps, reinstalling apps. I tested each individually as well. If you just want to control a switch while you are on your home network then this product is fine, but the remote function is necessary then I wouldn't bother.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Not working for me.,2.0 ,Not a fan. I have bought several of different manufactures wifi smart switches/plugs and this one keeps failing. It has to be constantly restarted.

"Functions well as promised, but wish there were a desktop app, too",4.0 ,"I've been using this product for a couple months and am happy with its performance. I plugged a file server into it that occasionally randomly needs a reboot when I'm not there in person to unplug it. I have successfully powercycled it 3 times by using this device remotely through my Motorola Xoom android tablet. It took me a couple tries to get it set up, but once I did I successfully got two different android devices to recognize and be able to control it via internet. I don't give it a fifth star because there is no app available to be able to access it from a desktop. That, and I wished it were a little cheaper for having only one plug available. But it has definitely delivered on what it promised and so far, so good.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It was fun to play with,3.0 ,"I'm a bit disappointed with this device. I was hoping to use it to monitor how much power my computer rig was using. I have my computer, monitors, scanner and so on plugged into a UPS that I then plugged into the WeMo. That was working fine until the power went out one day. The power was only out for a few minutes but the WeMo came up in the off position when the power was restored so when the batteries in my UPS were drained my computer stopped working anyway. Now I use it turn on the lamp in the living room so I don't have to get out of my chair.

Once we did get it set up, the second day it no longer recognizes the second device. Still can't fix. Went through customer service, left an email comment, got a response indicating they will make a note of the issue for future improvements. That's great for a future customer, but what about me now?

We travel quite often, and with Belkin's WEMO app on the iPhone or iPad, we can easily program lights to turn on at sunset, or at a specific time. Or we can simply turn them on or off, wherever we are. My wife really loves being able to remotely turn on all the front lights of our home before she arrives.

Have been happy for several years with WeMo,4.0 ,"I purchased a WeMo switch several years ago for a use at a remote location. It has been working flawlessly! If there are power outages, it recovers every time. It does default to ""off"" instead of the state it was in when the power went out, but I can live with that. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the setup is a bit ""clunky"". It is better than it used to be, but still not ""elegant"". I bought a new one to run a sump pump from a remote location. I think it will be just as reliable as the first one.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Limited lifetime,3.0 ,"I've had three WeMo switches used to control lighting over the last couple of years. The main plusses are the general features allowing users to control on/off on different schedules by day of the week. The WeMo app is okay though a bit cumbersome to use. The main negative is that they don't seem to stay functional for very long. I switched routers and therefore WiFi networks and had to reset all three switched. I was successfully able to reset only two of the three. After searching for answers, I contacted Belkin support and after about a half-hour on the phone concluded that the switch was no longer functional — of course it is no longer covered by the one-year warranty. On balance, they're useful during their lifetimes; I'd be glad to find an alternative that was easier to use and lasted longer.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Quickest Way To Make Your Home Smart,4.0 ,"I purchased this product on a whim with the hopes of controlling something in my house with my new Amazon Echo Dot. When I received the Wemo smart plug it came in a decent box, nothing fancy. It included the wemo plug and a small set of instructions. The setup was extremely easy and took me less then 10 minutes to complete. I only have one complaint about this product which is that it is bulky and fairly large. It will not fit behind a dresser without a few inches between it and the wall. But overall is a great product for people to buy with Amazon Alexa and for getting started with your smart home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"The device is not bad if you don’t care reliable. But for use seriously as security purpose, I am not confident to this device.",2.0 ,"I purchased WeMo switch from Amazon on 11/29/2013 for $39.99 (lightning deal $9.44 off) 1. This device is not reliable. Sometime work, sometime not work. When it not work, I called Belkin tech support, the tech support determined the device is broken, replacement is needed. 2. I believe this WeMo switch I received from amazon is not the one I ordered! The WeMo switch I received from amazon has Model number F7C027 on the device, no dot (or hole, can’t tell from the picture) in the middle of the device, but the picture from Amazon website of my order, the original packing box and Belkin website Model number F7C027fc, they all look the same to me, and they all have seven dot (or hole), in parallel line, at the middle of the device. The device I received, don't have the seven dot (or hole). 3. Service quality from Belkin customer care agent is a mix of good and bad. One customer service agent “approve” the replacement over the phone and via email confirmation, the other agent can change the “approval” to “pending approval”! Sometime the customer agent reply my email super-fast, in few minutes after I send my email request, or after phone conversation. But for some question I asked, I may never get an answer, such as what happen with the mystery in #2 above.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Two Switches - Neither worked,1.0 ,"I bought a WeMo Switch from Amazon. It didn't work, so I returned it and got another one. It didn't work either. Both units had the same problems. It took many tries to get the unit to recognize my wireless network, and I even had to remove the wireless security to get one of the units to recognize my network. Once that was done, the next step was for the app to recognize the WeMo Switch itself (under Recognize Device). Neither the iOS app, nor the Android app was able to recognize the switch. Definitely not recommended.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Great for one location, not two",4.0 ,"I love my Wemo Switch, except for one major flaw – the inability to control devices at multiple locations. For turning lights, appliances and other electronic devices on and off at a single location, it's terrific. But the inability to do so at multiple locations – a weekend home, say – is a pretty big drawback. Nest allows easy toggling back and forth between two locations; it shouldn't be that hard for WeMo to do the same.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

My husband spent a good 30-40 minutes researching online how to set the switch up before we got it working. Now that it is set up, we love it.

Wemo Switch might work if you are very lucky,3.0 ,Documentation on the web is totally inadequate. The Youtube video clips leave out all the important bits and concentrate on saying how easy it is to setup - just sales crap. Nowhere does it say that all of this is controlled by Belkin in the cloud. Nowhere does it say that a STUN NAT traversal system has to be setup and its hit and miss if this works each time. The switch times out after a few retrys and has to be reset. The instructions don't tell you this. If you are really luck then you might get it going. Even getting it going on the Wifi LAN this does not mean that it will work on 3G either.

High tech solution to an old problem,5.0 ,"In my case I needed a simple solution to turn lights on and off in my home while travelling. The item is nicely packaged, and the instructions are clear and concise. There are only a few steps to proper setup: 1. Plug in the switch 2. Download and install the app (Google’s Android or Apple’s IOS) 3. In the settings of your phone, link to the new WeMo network created. 4. Launch the app and connect the switch to your home network. I then plugged a lamp into the switch and I was able to turn the lamp on and off from the app in my phone. When you are traveling, this gives you complete control over the lights in your home, and you can also setup an on/off schedule or set it up to activate by motion in the room. All in all a great product so far. We will do further testing away from the house to simulate how it will respond when we are travelling.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Worst device EVER,1.0 ,"Terrible device, 2 were purchased. First there are so many limitations that we could not use them on our WiFi network unless we downgrade the entire security, what's the point?. The setup app on IOS was useless. After leaving them untouched for a year I decided to bring those home and test them again. I was able to set it up, it connected and then the wifi light turned off. Now device will not allow to be setup even after multiple reset. The phone won't connect or if it connect to the device WiFi it asks for password... what?? Basically this is going to trash and I will never purchase another Belkin product... I wasted hours of my time with those... Save yourself the trouble and get Z-Wave compatible products...","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great when it works; frustrating when it doesn't.,4.0 ,"When it works, the Wemo is a five-star product, especially when connected to my Alexa Speaker.

Bottom line: A 5 star product with issues.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Inconsistent & Unreliable,3.0 ,"We have several Wemo devices, but we have to reset them every 3 months, per Belkin. Why? We run them all on schedules (rules) so that they can work properly. However, the rules sometimes fail to work or will cut off early or not run at all. Belkin just advices to reset the unit entirely (or) edit the rule and click save (or) change the unit time zone (or) the list goes on. Each of these methods work, but only for a few months or so when they decide to go faulty on their own (or) Daylight Savings Time goes into effect.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Terrible and Frustrating,1.0 ,"I bought this switch so that it would work with the Amazon Echo. It connects with the WeMo and works one or two times. Then it is no longer detected by the WeMo. Resetting it, trying to add it back to the system, in fact anything I do results in the same two times of operating before it is not defected. This switch is terrible or else I was sent a defective product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Wish the MAC Address could be a bit easier to find,4.0 ,"The item works as expected. I had an issue with pairing via the Belkin app though. My network uses MAC addressing for wireless security, but the app does not show you the MAC address of the item when pairing. I checked the packaging and did not find it there as well. I had to remove the product from the outlet as the address was on a sticker on the back of the unit.

I repeated this process several times. Finally on my last attempt the device connected to my network and the app stated that the setup was ""successful"", yet it still failed to show up in the device list on the app. The most charitable thing I can say about this product is that Belkin really mastered the ""OFF"" feature.

I love this switch,5.0 ,I love this switch. Setup was a little frustrating because you have to wait a few minutes for your device to appear in the app. Very easy set up with Alexa. I use it to run a recirculating hot water pump.

Shame on Amazon,1.0 ,The Belkin Switch is great! The poor rating is for Amazon shipping me broken seal WeMo boxes that a feeble attempt to cover the broken seals with tape was made.

"Will not connect to ""N-only"" routers...",3.0 ,"I had my router (an ASUS RT-AC66U) configured for ""N only"" since all devices on our network supported the faster N speeds. Belkin is apparently stuck in the last decade and the WeMo switch doesn't work with ""N only"" routers. It detected the wireless network but wouldn't connect once I entered the password. I went into my router settings and switched from ""N only"" to ""auto"" and the WeMo found it easily and connected. Hope this helps if you're troubleshooting why your WeMo won't connect to your Wifi. Belkin's support website is terrible and doesn't give you any of this information.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I've had several updates by WEMO and have not run into the issues that some people speak of. One downside to the device is the size. If you are going to be using it in places that are hidden, then it shouldn't make any difference. If, however, you are planning on using it where people can see things, I would recommend using the WEMO Mini. This is what I will be doing when I get another batch of plugs, as they are smaller and allow easier utilization of the second outlet on the plug face.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Wemo Switch Smart Plug - Very Good Product!,4.0 ,Great product! - Works excellent with my phone and with Echo Dot (Alexa). I would have given it 5 Stars but I believe there is always room for improvements. In this case I'd like to see a web base method to manage my WEMO products so if I have 2 switches at my house and 2 at Grandma's house I can set them up and manage several locations independently. I currently have 5 switches all with schedules. If I replace my phone or lose it I need to set them all up again. With a Web based addition it would be a BIG help!

If it does not connect try this!,5.0 ,"Hey everyone! I was going to return this product but then found out the solution! I would consider myself a very tech savvy person and can figure nearly any problem that has to do with computers, routers, servers and the like but I nearly gave up on this one. The answer is really simple and quite annoying that it is not posted anywhere. The wireless internet that you are going to connect must have a security of WPA/WPA2 Personal ( I believe that only WPA will also work) Please feel to leave me comments or feedback if this doesn't work for you but I had success with 3 different routers at 3 different locations when I changed the security settings to WPA/WPA2 Personal. Best of luck to you!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Works amazingly!,5.0 ,"I've been using the WeMo Switch since late last summer. It's been wonderful since. Although, I couldn't control the switch from my phone for the first few months (It was human error; I didn't have a strong enough wifi signal to sync the WeMo to my router), I could easily turn my AC on and off manually without having to get out of my bed to do so. And once I readjusted the router placements in my house, I can finally enjoy what the WeMo has to offer. I can't wait until it's summer again, so I can turn on my AC as I'm headed home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Helpful and easy to use WiFi smart plug -- just not quite perfect,4.0 ,"I have several of WeMo switches. They are quite handy when it comes to creating a ""smart"" home. However, they do have some connection issues every few weeks. So far it's a simple fix: unplug and replug.

Super easy to use.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works fine but must be installed close to wireless router,3.0 ,"Works as described and will, at least for me. work remotely via iOS app. Only drawback for me is the, in my opinion, very limited range of the WIFI on this device. I had to move it to a different room, and thus different purpose than originally planned, because it would not obtain a signal from my wireless router. This is the only device I own that cannot obtain a wireless signal from my router regardless of location as long at it is inside the frame of the house. Increase the range on this unit and I would upgrade to 5 stars.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Junk - Don't waste your money,1.0 ,"I regret that I bought 3 of these things. They don't work. Constantly say ""not detected"" which defeats the purpose of the then entire product.

Flaky,2.0 ,I bought one and it seemed to work fine. I bought two more and now none of them are reliable. The Wemo app keeps losing the outlets. I can only control them in my house if I turn off wifi in my phone and use cellular data. The software is just very flaky and unreliable.

Great device. App could use updating.,4.0 ,These switches are amazing! Very easy to use and setup. I've read mixed suggestions about using it with a power strip (both plugging it into and plugging one into it) but they seem to be working fine with them in both scenarios.

weak or non existent wi-fi configuration connection to mobile app.,2.0 ,"This switch was difficult to setup because it was only offering intermittent connections from the mobile app. After some struggles to get a connection, and set it up it worked well for 2 months, then failed, and though I could see the wemo network for an instant (which allows the mobile app to connect and configure the switch), I could no longer get a reliable connection.

Terrible reliability problems,1.0 ,"I've had 3 out of 4 of these go bad in the past 6 months (not all were purchased from Amazon). These are good when they work, but they are not reliable at all. These will also have sporadic issues connecting to WiFi so it's hard to trust them for the rules based on/off timers and remote control.

such a great purchase,4.0 ,"I always wanted to buy one of these switch which is finally happend . I bought this switch for my wall Air conditioning system so I could turn it on before I get home. I know AC systems has their own timer feature but sometimes you set them up for example to comes on at 6 pm but your plan get change and you'll end up going home late night so that AC will work hours for no reason and wasting energy/money. But now with my WeMo I turn on my AC anytime from anywhere I want. I have to say this switch is an awesome device but nothing is perfect and always there is some issues. The issue that I experienced with this device is that in case Internet goes out for any reason like power outage or Internet provider outage , the switch get stock and it doesn't connect back to the wifi router. I have to mention that if you want to buy this switch for your wall AC system , first you need to test your wall AC system to make sure it's will turn back on If you disconnect power from it unless this switch would be usless for that matter.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I could set up the switch from the Kindle but once the switch joined my network, the Wemo app could not find any devices. Belkin support could only suggest trying a different mobile device even though the Kindle is listed as a supported device. I loaded the app on my wife's Samsung Galaxy S2 and it worked fine.

Its fun to show off...when it works.,4.0 ,"Like the title says, its a great ""toy"" for your house, when it works. However, I must say I think the problem is more with the WeMo app than it is with the actual switch itself. The app has trouble finding it and we have an amazing home network, so I know its not that. Is it worth the $50, depends. I think its kind of a steep price for it. I think $30-$35 would be more reasonable.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Very poor device + app combination,2.0 ,"After much coaxing and navigating through their painful app, I finally had it working for about a week or so.

In my home I could never detect any of the devices but outside (remotely) I could. Problem was it never worked the way it should and after hours of fussing with this I am sending it back.

Internet of Things needs some work,2.0 ,"As the ""Internet of Things"" this product has a limited utility. If you live in a one internet zone home and need to control a few switches remotely, it is probably useful. If you live in a residence that has multiple zones (SSID access points) or if you have switches in multiple physical locations, this product is not ready for prime time. You can only use these switches on a single network with an iPhone. If a single SSID device covered my house, it would be easier to run around and flip switches manually than use WeMo devices. The set-up was also unduly complicated. Each switch required four firmware upgrades to bring them up to date. Makes one wonder if the inventory is obsolete. I'll research Belkin devices more thoroughly before I buy another one.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Terrible product and unreliable,1.0 ,"Do not buy this!!! After wasting a couple hours of my life attempting to get this to work properly, I have given up. While it would connect to the internet, trying to enable any kind of remote access would not work. After resetting, it would no longer connect to my internet. Item was plugged in behind a nightstand and couldn't connect to a strong wireless signal. If you'd like to be extremely frustrated and uncertain this will work properly, then give it a try!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"So useful, but some small issues",4.0 ,"First and foremost, if you have poor signal, change your router wifi channel and maybe unhide it if it's a hidden network. I like the ability to turn things on and off by my phone. There are a few things I'd like to improve though. There should be custom icons, there should be the ability to insert special characters for the room name and wifi password. Oh, and there should be Windows/RT support. Still, worth getting.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"So far so good! (WeMo ""Smart Plug"" wall outlet Switch)",5.0 ,"This review is for the WeMo Switch Smart Plug, not for any of the other WeMo products also lumped together in reviews here. Based on the blanket of poor ratings, I avoided this unit at first, in my search for a smart plug and instead went with the Xenon brand, and, while I loved that one, and it worked great, it stopped working after a few days (see my review if curious about what happened). The Seller did promise to replace it, but, while waiting, I did a bit more looking around, and discovered that this WeMo is actually a Belkin product, though sold under their ""WeMo"" branding, and, because I've never had anything but pretty good experiences with Belkin, and it was on sale here, I though I'd give it a try, despite the sad ratings. My need for a smart plug is to control space heaters remotely. Now that it is winter, my apartment, as well as my office, get mighty cold. My option to date has either been to arrive at home, or work, in a freezing environment, or, waste money leaving heaters on when I'm not around -- which gets very expensive when I'm gone at work for 12 or 14 hours and I am heating an empty apartment. Ideally, what I need to do is be able to just turn the heat on a few hours before I get to work, or a few hours before I get home. And, it seemed this ""smart plug"" invention was the way to solve it. Since my office heats up faster than my apartment, and I hate coming home to an igloo, much more than arriving at a cold office, I figured I'd try this one at home, first, to replace the Xenon unit that had failed after a few days of use. Set up was incredibly easy -- connected right up to my WiFi, and instructions were simple to decipher. I tested it a few times throughout the first day, and no issues with connectivity and no issues controlling my heater at home. Did some remote testing as well, and every time it was perfect -- when the app says it was on, it was on; when it said it was off, it was off. I was able to trigger it both on any WiFi network as well as on my 4G LTE service. At this point then, I have had the best experience, no problems whatsoever. I'll update if anything goes wrong or stops working. After all, the Xenon unit also earned 5 stars at first, until it quit on me. If this WeMo keeps up the great performance, I may not bother trying out the replacement Xenon (if, or when, I actually receive it) and will very likely just buy a second one of these, for my office heater, although I'm not sure how it works to have two smart plugs on two different networks, controlled by the same app....not sure if that's something I can even do, but hopefully. If not, I have a second WiFi device (my cell phone from last year) that I can use to control the work one, if it comes to that. I'll update, as I said, if anything goes awry, but, for me, this one is easily five stars, and I'm not sure what is going on with all of the awful reviews for this (and wow there are a LOT of bad experiences reported here) but maybe, like the Xenon, there are quality control issues happening, and I just got lucky and received a good one, I don't know... I think part of the issue, maybe, is that all of the WeMo products here are lumped together in the reviews, which is unfortunate, because the 8 products listed should really each have their own review section, so someone can see feedback for a specific WeMo product, not just all feedback put together for all 8 of the WeMo items listed. In any case, I hope this is helpful for those looking at the Smart Plug wall switch. It's working great for me and I easily recommend it, based on my experience so far. Thanks for reading!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I tried it on many different wireless networks and with many different phones, and we could never get the switch to be controlled from a phone.

although the Android software worked fine. Possibly I overlooked it,5.0 ,"Switch works well, but instructions could be clearer. A few steps were left out. None were too difficult to figure out if you have even minor network experience, but it would have been appreciated if the instructions were clearer and more complete. Once functioning, it is working flawlessly with our Echo and Kindle. Some Win10 software to support it would be appreciated at some point, but none exists that I could locate on the WEMO website, although the Android software worked fine. Possibly I overlooked it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Nice product!,5.0 ,We have a home away from home. I bought two of these to be able to turn on the lights whenever. We have a security system with one light control. But I like to have more control and the cost to get another one from ADT was more than the two of these. Plus I can set these up to come on when I want or just get on my phone and turn them on as needed. I really like them and will be ordering more in the future!,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Only 50% of their products work at best,1.0 ,"This product does not work. It will not connect to wifi, and none of the trouble shooting tips work, either. The device is compatible with my wifi network; this product is just defective. I have had similar issues with Wemo products in the past; about 50% of the products I purchase work,-'d the other 50% don't. I have four outlets like this one it only two of them work. I will be returning this and getting a different brand which is disappointing because I like that it works with the Nest system.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
life made simple,5.0 ,"shipped in perfect condition. quick and simple set up via an android phone and shared on a iPhone. controlled easily from alexa and either phone. bonus is that we got rid of the old school timer that we had to change as the sunset moved and it made that horrid clicking sound. i will buy additional switches in future. fun tip: give your switch a proper name so you can use phrases like ""turn on george"" instead of the boring ""turn on lamp""","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Great little entry to the Home Automation world,5.0 ,"Works perfect in conjunction with the iPhone app. Tie these things to the IFTT website to do even more! For my use, turning off lamps from bed once I get there, turning them on automatically at sunset, remotely turning on/off christmas lights, and lastly, adding one to the girls straightener so that you no longer get those ""Can you check my straightener?"" phone calls when she has left for work. :) Would be nice if they were a little less bulky, but that's my only complaint. I'd also like to see some multiple switch versions of the WeMo light switches, but that doesn't really have anything to do with this specific product. This one does what it's supposed to.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

It has worked perfectly so far.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Unreliable junk.,1.0 ,"Don't waste your money. I tried several different WeMo devices. It works for a few weeks or months.

Works well,5.0 ,"I like it so far, cheaper option for controlling a single outlet.

It connects about half the time the first time. If I remember to go back and try again and again I can usually get it to turn on. I sent an email to Belkin who sent a form letter back saying that it was my network. It certainly could have been a few times but a little hard to believe it's always my network.

Public Service Announcement ~ Great Idea; Horrible Execution. Please don't waste your time.,1.0 ,"If you look at my profile I've written numerous positive reviews and rarely, if ever, write negative ones. Not because I don't encounter sub-standard products but I like to focus on the good. This product is one exception. I'm am pretty tech savvy and have a diy connected home so I've installed every smarthome product you can imagine, many of them multiple times as I try and find the best [thermostat, lights, security system, video cameras, irrigation system, etc, etc, etc]. In the connected home technology landscape, this is a very simple device that in the spectrum when compared to its connected device brethren is not that sophisticated which means it should just work...right out of the box...99.99% of the time. Well, let me assure you, that simply is not the case with these devices. I actually attempted to install this older model wemo switch, returned it to Amazon, and attempted install the newer wemo insight switch. I can tell you they must be drowning trying to get this basic device to work for folks. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Belkin technical support...woman was amazingly polite and professional but concluded the call by telling me that either my new iphone6 was the problem or the WeMo switch [which would not even take a simple firmware upgrade]. Please don't waste your time. Unless Belkin blows-up the current hardware design, firmware, and app and starts from scratch...this is not a device you want to depend on in your connected home. It will frustrate you.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Wife Loves Them,5.0 ,"I bought two of the WeMo Switches as sort of gag tech Christmas gift for my wife and it turns out she loves the darn things. They were easy to install and they hooked up to our wireless system without issue. My wife uses them all of the time with the app on her phone, turning the lights on before entering the driveway, turning the lower level light on before coming down in the morning, and going up in the evening. There are programming functions in the app and maybe some day she will get to them.

Finally Worked! It's Great. Now What?,4.0 ,"It was the devil of the time to get this to work, and I nearly gave up: had the switch back in the box for shipping. Then I tried, one more time - put my router, WeMo, and iPhone right on top of each other. Literally stacked up. It connected. Works great now. Hook-up to Alexa was easy.

"Do NOT purchase if you like having long, secure passphrases for your WiFi.",1.0 ,"I bought this to hook up with our Echo and I'm glad that was all it was for. Took a few to get connected to it, but that part wasn't too bad. However, as soon as I tried to connect it to our home WiFi I found that it does NOT support spaces or special characters in WPA2 passwords. Seriously. This is 2015, people, not 2005. NO networking product should not support spaces and/or special characters in passwords as they help make sure it's secure! Since it was only going to be used with the Echo and not serious home automation, I figured I would hook it into a guest network on our WiFi instead. I created a long password with nothing but numbers and letters (again, all it will support), tried to connect it ... it doesn't support 5 GHz WiFi either, or if it does, it sucks so badly at picking up the network that it couldn't find it. There are half a dozen WiFi networks close to us, and every other networking device I've ever used sees them all, from smartphones to tablets and everything in between ... except this. It saw our regular home WiFi network and the next door neighbors. Nothing else. This is simply an embarrassing network/home automation product and Belkin should be ashamed of themselves for putting it out with such serious defects. Needless to say, it's going back and no WiFi product of theirs is ever coming into our house again.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Idea is great - execution is subpar,2.0 ,"Love the fact that it works with Alexa right out of the box without hubs, BUT i have two things i HATE about it. 1- the design is very bad, if you use it in a double wall jack which most homes have, it renders the free jack unusable since it does not leave room for anything else to plug. 2- when the app had 3-4 Wemo products connected to it, it worked fine, now that i have 13 of them, it randomly detects 1-2 of them and says the others are undetected even though Alexa can still control them fine, they just do not work from the app, and if i refresh the list of devices, some other random 2 will be detected and the others not detected EVEN THOUGH I AM ON THE HOME NETWORK, which makes the app very unreliable when you are away from home because you will always face the risk of not being able to connect to the device you want to control","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"You can check in, but you can't check out",3.0 ,"For those who plan to use this with the Amazon Echo and control it by voice command, be aware that Alexa currently can turn the device on, but she can't turn it off. It's rather like checking into a Roach Motel. Amazon support tells me they recognize and are working on the problem. Otherwise, the switch seems to work well both ways using the Wemo app, although setup is rather clunky compared to other wireless stuff like Sonos components. I'll update when Amazon fixes the Echo glitch. UPDATE: I don't know if it's because Echo support has been at work, but I discovered that I could get the switch to turn both on and off with Echo if I put it in a group using the Echo app and named the group ""WeMo."" This work-around is great if you have a single switch, but it obviously doesn't work if you have multiple switches/groups.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Maybe the two I bought from Best Buy were from a defective lot. I plan to try one more from Amazon and if that doesn't work, I'm through.

Same Old Belkin,1.0 ,"Why would I think that because they branded these devices WEMO that Belkin could produce a product that works any better than their old routers, printer servers, and all the other kludgy stuff they have produced over the years? Joke is on me. I am an early adopter. I have nest, use IFTTT, have my 4th iphone, my 2nd ipad, a mac a pc, a KILLER ASUS ROUTER. I'm no network administrator but I know my way around home electronics. My WEMO devices are pathetic. It's the technology. It must be. My Nest works like a charm and if the router reboots or the power goes off, it's right back online. So does my iphone, ipad, on and on and on. I rebooted my router and both of my wemo devices went silent. I spent 2 hours following the instructions and another hour on the phone with tech support and they still wont connect back. They get close... but they dont connect. The person on the phone said I needed to be closer to the router. The person via email said I needed to add the MAC Addresses to my DHCP list on my router. I would happily do that but since they told me to delete the app and reinstall it, the app wont show the MAC address until I connect. This item is marketed well. It has great partnerships with Nest, IFTTT and others but bottom line it's a kludgy Belkin product. As was in 2002, as is now. Their technology just isn't reliable. I had them working for a while. I had them turn on window units when my Nest got to a certain temp. That's a great story. But my story has a bad ending. The trash can. Total junk.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Poorly designed,1.0 ,"I bought this to try with my Amazon Echo. Connecting the Echo to Wifi was effortless. This switch on the other hand was incapable of connecting to multiple routers. After seeing the insanity that people were going through trying to get this thing connected, I decided this product isn't worth my time. I guess Belkin needs to get some help from Amazon's engineers on how to create a good setup experience for the consumer. The reset procedure to get it back to the mode in which it broadcasts its own network is insane. You have to hold the button down while plugging it back in. Why is that necessary? Router manufacturers have allowed you to reset to factory defaults by long pressing a button forever. Belkin couldn't figure that out? Did I mention that it also takes several minutes before it even broadcasts? It's a lot of fun resetting this thing over and over to try and get a connection.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Don't buy this product unless you are extremely patient and have the money to throw away or the patience to return it. The Chromecast has a similar way of connecting and it does so without any issue. I don't understand why it is such a sporadically working setup process. The description needs to change from ""easy setup"" to ""frustrating and might not work setup experience. It is suggested to take a day off work and grab a couple of beers. Also, be prepared to fail in setting up this device up. Do not be afraid of failure. Failure is part of success and success does not come easy. It is better to have tried to setup a WeMo switch than to never have tried to setup a WeMo switch at all."" Good luck possible buyers... Update: I was able to finally get it to update the firmware (was left updating overnight). I seem to have replicated this about three times now: Disconnect the outlet for about 10 minutes, use the reset button (as stated in the WeMo reset process: hold while plugging back in and until amber light blinks), close the WeMo app, connect to WeMo wifi SSID, relaunch WeMo app and finally attempt to connect again. It's finally working. I will raise it from 1 start to 2 for this. Another Update: The WeMo switch disconnected from my WiFi and I can no longer access it from the WeMo app. I'm am returning this item. I am not sure if the newer Insight Switch is any better than this one, but I might give it a shot. However, I will be researching other smarthome products as well. Don't buy this mode. It definitely has issues. Back to one star.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Let me save you a lot of trouble,1.0 ,"What a total waste of time and money. Do not purchase Wemo products if you have an Apple router; after my experience, I'd be hesitant to purchase them at all, no matter what kind of router I had. We have an Apple wireless router and Apple devices. If you look on troubleshooting websites you'll see that Wemo devices do not work well with Apple wireless, which I now know thanks to hours of completely wasted time and increasing aggravation. However, since this ""glitch"" is never discussed in the product description or in any documentation produced by Wemo or Belkin, I purchased this product in good faith and spent HOURS yesterday trying to get it to work, including rebooting and reinstalling several times, reconfiguring my wireless platform, etc., etc. Wemo troubleshooting guides are poorly organized and contain conflicting or incomplete information--totally maddening. I tried for live chat, but there was never a customer service representative available. I finally picked up the phone, and got a customer service rep fairly quickly, which was good, except that she was unable to spell my first name or last name, or get my address correct after several tries (she was based in the United States--no language barrier, just incompetence). She was nice, but completely incapable of offering assistance (has she ever used a Wemo device, I wonder?). Completely frustrating experience. If, after this experience, I thought Wemo had good product support, I might consider switching to a Belkin router (my own conclusion, however, since Belkin never actually says that this would be helpful, and instead lets potential customers twist in the wind). However, given the abysmal troubleshooting documentation and unqualified technical support, I will not take the risk of screwing up my entire home network for the convenience of remote control of a few light switches and coffee pots. Oh, and by the way, be careful of the promise that the switch will help you turn on coffee remotely (the FIRST feature listed under the switch). I can't say for sure, because I could never get my switch to work, but if your coffee maker doesn't have a switch that will set permanently to ""on"" (not a button or a spring lever), then the Wemo switch won't work to turn on your coffee maker. Perhaps this should be obvious, but, then again, perhaps Wemo should engage in a little more honest marketing for its products.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I'd rather screw around with an app and my phone (which I look at way too often anyway) to turn on a light? WTF is wrong with me?! And what is wrong with society?

Overall I'm satisfied. The only real limitation is with the lamps ...,4.0 ,"I purchased three of these in a recent sale to automate the turning on/off of three lamps in my living and dining room. Overall I'm satisfied. The only real limitation is with the lamps and the fact that you need to have them in a permanent ""on"" state for the switches to be used properly. Turning any one of the lamps off manually at the pull chain will mean that the switch is no longer able to turn the lamp on. # Installation Installation was simple. Download WeMo smart phone application, plug in switch, connect phone to WeMo device, configure to use your house's WiFi. You can also rename the device to make it easily identifiable. Afterwards I was asked to update the devices via the remote a couple of times which all went smoothly. *Make sure you don't unplug your devices after hitting the button to allow the update to happen. You could potentially cause problems with your devices. # Rules Setting up rules was extremely straightforward. I went in to the WeMo application and chose which devices I wanted on/off and the times for them. # Integration with Amazon Echo In the Amazon Echo smartphone application it was able to immediately detect the three new switches. I was able to add them to a named group that allows me to turn them all on and off with a simple ""Alexa, turn the lamps on"" or ""Alexa, turn the lamps off"". # Integration with IFTTT I was also able to configure these switches to work with the IFTTT service. I created a DO button on my phone that would toggle all of these switches at once. As an added bonus the DO button was also available on my Moto 360 smartwatch. Which means I can toggle the lamps on and off from my wrist when I'm leaving the house or coming home. The one downside to using IFTTT is that they can only toggle from on to off and vice versa and not explicitly turn off or on.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I control everything via Alexa, setup is a breeze and they update the firmware often for improvements.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great for home - with one exception,4.0 ,"This product is fantastic, with one caveat. When I bought this product, I was hoping that I could use it to turn on my air conditioner before I got home from work. With these hot summer days, I often come home to a sauna and it can take as long as 30 mins to cool it down. I thought that I could use the Wemo Switch to turn on the air conditioner in my bedroom right when I finished work, so when I got home it would be cool and refreshing. Regrettably, this product did not work with my air conditioner. I tried leaving the air conditioner on, turning the Wemo off and then on again, but instead of turning the air conditioner on again, the air conditioner stayed off. After many attempts and some research, I found that some air conditioners have a ""stay on after loss of power option"" and that if you turned that option on, the Wemo Switch would work. Unfortunately, my AC didn't have that option. I suggest you look to see if your AC has that option if that is what you want to use this switch for. Despite this mishap, I realized (with some fiddling around) that my air conditioner already has a timer to turn on after a set number of hours, so now I am using the Wemo Switch for my lamp. I get home late from work sometimes and when I forget to leave a light on in the morning, I come home to a pitch-black house. Now I can switch my lamp on before it gets dark, allowing me to both save energy and avoid stumbling around the house at night looking for a light switch. Overall, this is a great switch that adds a little more convenience to life. I am very happy with this switch and will likely buy another one in the near future.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

DO NOT BUY!!! FIND ALTERNATIVE!!!!,1.0 ,"DO NOT BUY!!!! FIND ALTERNATIVE! I bought 3 of these a few months back with horrible results. If you need something reliable, DO NOT BUY THESE!!! If you need something that works remotely while your away from your home network, DO NOT BUY!!!! By far it is one of the most unreliable products I have ever come across. Please take a minute and go to the BELKIN Support Website and read the reviews about the constantly changing never ending connection issues with these switches(Primarily REMOTE Connection). We run both IOS and Android and see the same connection issues on both. BELKIN does respond to the complaints verbally, but that's were it starts and ends, just lip service, no actual solutions. Reset, uninstall/install app, move wi-fi closer, updates, hard reset, go to this link, blah blah blah........ Even if you get the fix to work, it's generally short lived. If your accessing the switches from within your wifi network they seem to work pretty good, but if you need to access these while your away from home FORGET IT!!! The remote reliability is literally under 50%. Considering we use these as part of a security setup, you can see why were switching to something else.Another reason you might want to look elsewhere, as you read the complaints and responses, you get the impression BELKIN is walking away from this product line? If less than 50% works for you and you like reading 'Device Not Detected'.......have at it! UPDATE: Finally gave up on these, tried the TP-LINK outlets and yes, there are alternatives. ALTERNATIVES THAT WORK!!!! Belkin, rather than handing out your sorry cheap worthless lip service, why don't you make a product that works. 2 years later and your product is still as worthless and unreliable as it was from the beginning!!!! Unbelievable! I'm really surprised there isn't a class action pertaining to this product?","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Completely useless after the last firmware upgrade,1.0 ,"These worked great when I first got two of them, then the geniuses at belkin decided to release firmware that wasn't properly tested. Both of my devices would lose connection 5 to 6 times a day. I contacted belkin about my issue and their support is even more useless than these devices are now. They told me to: • Restart your handset. • Close the application, disconnect the WeMo device from the power source for about 20-30 seconds then plug it back in. Re-open the application and try again. • Restart your router. • Delete the application from your phone then re-install it. They wanted me to do this EACH TIME THEY LOST CONNECTION!?!? The last thing they told me was to reset the devices to the factory default settings, which I did since the other ''solutions"" were moronic. So after resetting them to factory settings (now mind you firmware is BURNED IN, so I only reset it's setting, the new programming remained flawed) they now will not connect to the wifi network, so essentially they are junk.

Great Idea - Terrible Execution!,1.0 ,"Belkin, I know the trend is to kick hardware products out the door soon as possible, with the idea that a subsequent software update will fix everything later, but really, stop. At least bother to test it once. I've worked in app engineering for over a decade, and this is the most ill conceived and thoroughly untested gadget I've encountered in that time. For the price you're asking, you've got to be joking, only the joke really isn't funny at any price. The UX design on the app is non-existent, you cannot setup multiple rules! The workflow leaves me feeling like a lab rat and there actually is no cheese in the maze! WHO WANTS A SWITCH THAT ONLY TURNS ON AND STAYS ON!! This is thick.

Started working better after resetting... Better products on the market than this...,2.0 ,"I was hoping to use this switch to automatically turn my lights on in the morning. It worked great for a week, but it no longer turns on automatically with the other lights assigned to the same ""rule."" Obviously the rule is working, because the light switches are turning on/off, but both of the outlet switches are doing the same thing by not responding to rules or voice commands using Echo. If you look at the app, it constantly says the outlet switch is unavailable, which is connectivity issue. Not sure if it's actually a hardware problem or if this can be fixed via firmware, hopefully the latter, but the several comments I've sent to customer service over the last few days are being ignored, so it does not appear they intend to be responsive to this situation. I will update my review as things change, but I'm probably sending one of the two switches I have back as it is obviously a defective product in its current state. UPDATE (5/31/2016): Decided to keep the switches since they did respond and were willing to ""help."" I did regain more reliable connectivity after resetting the device, but I'm no longer using it for my lights because the Wink Hub and its products seem to work much better. I've been using GE Link Bulbs and a GE Z-Wave switch, which are far better than the WeMo products (admittedly, I have not tried the new WeMo light bulb, however, the Wink Hub can interact with so many products that it makes home automation more practical. WeMo has extremely basic automation functionality). All that said, I'm giving them another star for the time being because it is working a little better than before. UPDATE (8/25/2017): WeMo works fine these days, but the products are overpriced and I am still completely satisfied with the Wink system in ways WeMo can't even perform. My entire house now has automated lighting with Echo controlling them via voice commands, and my 2 WeMo switches and 1 still working of 2 originally purchased outlets are the weak links in my setup. If my Nest Protect alarm sounds for any reason, all my lights except for the WeMo's will turn on. My mood light setting voice commands will control everything except for the WeMo's. So, after writing this review I realize that not only do I need to replace the switches, cuz seriously, out of my entire house it's only 2 more, but I also have to lower my rating back down to a 2 star.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
So much better than a non-smart timer plug.,5.0 ,Great for turning lamps on and off in the house based on sunrise and sunset rather than a specific time.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
meh,3.0 ,"Purchased this because I wanted to be able to remotely power cycle my home server while away. Unfortunately, these WeMo switches seem to, every once in awhile, shut off and take down whatever device was connected to it. Opening the app (or pressing the button on the switch) is enough to bring the device back up. But since the intent was to minimize the amount of downtime, this device failed it's main objective by adding new problems into the mix. I replaced my previous model, and have a second on another computer as well. All 3 have done it at random intervals. Not enough for it to be a huge problem but enough for it to be a major annoyance. I also didn't like how the mobile/remote setup is done. I want to open up a port in my router, forward it to the device, and have a web page (with login) that I can access when away. Instead I have to launch the app while on the same wifi network and hope that the setup is robust enough to survive any potential network/IP changes while I'm away. Their method is significantly easier to initially set up but I want flexibility If you just have a simple use case (I want to turn this lamp on while I'm away) then this works. The programming is good enough for a lamp timer but my settings somehow got erased after an update and if you don't care about remote on/off then a simple dump $5 timer will do the job just as well Ended up just buying a real web power switch to do an even better job at what I want","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Works as I hoped...,4.0 ,"I have two installed 260 miles from my house and they work. I can turn on and off two different 120V appliances hours before I arrive, very nice. Installation can be a nightmare. One was easy, one took a half hour of resetting, rebooting, etc. Power failures seem to have no effect, they both come right back on line after. Ipad use works, have not tried any other devices. So far, so good, I was very skeptical. I ran a 1500watt heater through one for a couple hours to see how it handled it and no problems, it got somewhat warm that is all. Works from my home network (260 miles away) or Verizon LTE anywhere. Great idea, I have been looking for years. More thoughts after some use. 1) Needs good strong wifi signal for these switches to work consistently. Marginal wifi will make operation sporatic. 2) The rules you can establish using the ipad app work well and are stored on the switch not on the app so they will work if your ipad is disconnected or off. This is very important and I feel they designed this well. If no connectivity, the rules will still function. 3) IFTTT is great, works well and is something to learn about. Amazing. Turn on a heater when it snows, turn on a light at sunset, flash a light when a email arrives, text when a Wemo switch is turned on or off or both, lots more, etc. 4) One ipad/iphone can control one set of switches on ONE wifi. If you want to control two sets of switches on different wifis (such as at different locations) you need another app on a different ipad/iphone. One each, that is it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"My least-reliable ""Smart"" Device",2.0 ,"If you're planning to use the WeMo smart plug with the Samsung SmartThings Hub ... think twice. Mine has been a source of endless problems, especially when compared with Z-wave alternatives. Let's start with the basics: this plug is enormous and ugly. It if you install it in the top socket of a duplex receptacle, it doesn't quite block the lower socket... but you'll need a relatively slim cord to be able to use it. The device has a prominent, lighted On/Off switch, which is good since you'll need to use it frequently. The device requires a connection to your WiFi network, so setup is a little more involved than with a Z-wave switch. Controlling the WeMo Smart Plug via the WeMo iPhone app frequently works, but doesn't allow any sort of automation: you press the software ""button"" and the light turns on. Press it again and the light turns off. Occasionally you'll have to tap the software button multiple times to get the switch to activate. Connecting the WeMo Smart Plug to your SmartThings hub is comparatively easy once you've connected it to your WiFi network. Keeping it ""online"" and usable by SmartThings is where the problems start. All of my SmartThings-connected devices are eminently reliable... except the WeMo Smart Plug. Every couple of days, it will show up as being ""offline"" for no apparent reason and the only way to make it work again is to physically unplug it from the wall, then plug it in again so that it reboots. Usually that's all that's necessary to get the WeMo working again, but the disconnects happen frequently enough that you simply can't rely on this switch to work. I've had one or two occasions where a simple reboot didn't work and I ended up having to delete the switch from SmartThings, repair it, and then update all of the SmartApps and Routines that used it. If you need a reliable smart plug, I would recommend using the GE Lighting Duplex Receptacle for in-wall installation or a Z-wave controlled smart plug like the Samsung SmartThings Outlet , GE Lighting Appliance Module , or GE Lighting Lamp Module with Dimmer Control . All of these are far more reliable than the WeMo Smart Plug, in my experience.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

WiFi Switch That Can't Connect to WiFi,1.0 ,"I was beyond excited to get this product since I have a real need for it (installing a sign high on a wall with a socket and it'd be easier to use this than a switch). When I received the switch I went through the directions to connect it to my network. It didn't work. I checked the troubleshooting steps. Try moving to a closer outlet, at least for initial connection it said. Okay, I plugged it into an outlet a few feet from my router. Nope. Is your password correct? Troubleshooting offered. Yes, it is, thank you. I've connected plenty of devices to it. Does my router have enough connections? Sure does. Does my password have any special characters? Nope. Just letters and numbers. Still doesn't connect. Restore the firmware. Um, okay. Did that. Now restart your iPhone. Did that too. Still no good. The final bit troubleshooting offered me was to change my network security. At this point I smiled and unplugged the unit, put it back in the box and told Amazon I was returning it. If your WiFi switch is going to try and change my home WiFi network and make me redo all my other devices then I don't even care if you work I'm going to return you for your stupidity and warn people off. Maybe I just got a defective unit, but I don't care. Buh bye.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

One Star,1.0 ,"These work well for low power items like a lamp or a lamp but absolutely do not use on anything that is mid to high wattage like a heater or laptop/desktop computer as the wemo will melt your power cord and burn the wemo unit. Once the wemo gets burnt it is really no longer safe to use and also breaks the wifi functionality. They claim it can handle up to 1800 watts but I believe they must be measuring in peak and not RMS because i have had two of these burn and melt fusing the power cord permanently to the wemo. I don't know why there is no thermal safety sensor, thermal breaker, or even software update that could calculate watts usage over time and have adjustable safty shut off prior to melting and causing electrical fire. I guess a few dozen houses or apartment complexes have to burn down first before Belkin updates this serious design flaw.

I purchased one so that I could control my heater in the office from my house. My hopes were that I'd be able to get up in the morning and just before getting in the car I'd turn on the heater. By the time I'd get to the office everything would be nice and warm. Unfortunately this technology seems like it's half-baked. At best. I can connect the WeMo initially to my WiFi. But that's where my experience ended. I had no luck creating a PIN to connect it to the online service IFTTT. Then when I went to shut the device off (while still in my office) the Belkin could not be found. I'm pretty disappointed.

Good Luck with the Setup,2.0 ,I agree with the many reviewers who thought the Wemo switch was a good idea but its implementation needs a lot of work. I spent several hours trying to complete the setup. About the best I could do was to place the Wemo practically on top of my WiFi router -- then I could get through the setup but when I moved the Wemo to where I wanted to use it it didn't work. It's way too much trouble for a simple ON-OFF switch that you can operate (supposedly) from your iPhone. The Wemo's shortcomings far outweigh its potential usefulness. I ended up returning it to Amazon for a refund -- thank goodness for Amazon's return policies.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"Works, but not without connectivity issues and logic settings improvements plus, now random power recycling",2.0 ,"When it comes to remote wifi switches, or anything with networking, reviews are always mixed. I purchased a different wifi switch and it was not even recognized by my phone so I returned it. I tried the belkin and had luck in establishing a connection and set it up. To start with, the instructions could be a little more clearer. Be patient and look up videos. Even during my setup, I had issues connecting the device and the firmware upgrade was wonky. I also saw a review about one that was burned that was connected to a heater and I have to disagree with the review. First, it is rated for 15A resistive loading. I have a heater rated at 15A but that is inductive load. Big difference in power dissipation. At maximum loading, the actual power dissipated would be more than rated power which would burn the device. I just set my heater switch to one and that's it. For the price, I would have liked to see energy usage. I also don't like the logic settings for the schedule. However, it works so I'll see what happens. I'm yet to monitor out-of-home operation so we'll see. Updated on 12/13/2016 - I've down graded to 2 stars. I have a VOIP adapter that somehow needs daily power recycling so I am using this to just that. I was on my computer and saw/heard the smart plug recycling power every so often. Hence, my phone was cutting in and out. I've ordered the TP Link so we'll see. I'm buying an EV and will need a reliable smart switch switch to do what needs to be done.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Buggy software makes this unreliable and potentially unsafe,1.0 ,"I purchased this product to control an espresso machine, hoping it would preheat the machine before I woke up in the morning. I have had a very mixed experience with this product and all of it seems to boil down to bugs in the Wemo software. My quick summary is that the product is good but that the recurring software problems left me with the opinion that this isn't just a bad product, it can also become an unsafe product depending on what you are controlling with that outlet. (Wemo illustrates an iron being controlled by this outlet! Imagine what could happen if that came on at the wrong time.) It is just too unreliable. In the 10 months I have owned this product, the one recurring theme has been that at various times the outlet has turned on when it wasn't supposed to, according to the rules I have set. Two of the three periods where I saw this happen were the week after the clocks changed for Daylight Savings Time. When I first got the product, things were off by one hour, so I adjusted my rules to match that error. Then, one day, they corrected something and the rules started running on time. When Daylight Savings Time began, I had to reset everything to get it working right: the outlet would turn on at the wrong time. Most recently (following the end of Daylight Savings Time), the outlet is coming on at 7PM instead of 8AM: so it isn't just a matter of them losing track of one hour. Once the setup goes into this mode, the only solution is to start over with the configuration. They have again directed me to reinstall my entire setup: mobile software, resetting the outlet device and re-entering the rules. It is consuming more time than it is worth. A simple mechanical timer would be more reliable than this thing. I think if you have the patience to fiddle with their software and endure through the problems when they arise, then maybe Wemo is for you. I've had my fill of it at this point.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

It works,5.0 ,"I bought the Belkin WeMo Switch and the Belkin WeMo Light Switch. I was skeptical that they wouldn't work, but I've been pleasantly surprised so far. The application/timer setup was fairly basic and easy. (People reported issues here, but you should be fine if you are technology competent at a 6th grade level.) I have this plug-in wall switch attached to a pair of lamps and set to turn on at sunset and then off later in the evening. It works to do that just fine. The light switch controls exterior lights and is set to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise. At times, the app on my phone doesn't let me manually turn these on or off. It, at those times, can't find the devices. That might be an issue with my wireless connection's strength and not an issue with the product, though. It seems the timers have worked consistently as far as I've noticed. I am completely thrilled with these products and the convenience they have added.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Functional & Frustrating,2.0 ,"This thing is a nightmare, mostly due to the fact that the supporting smartphone app (required for use) is absolute trash. Forget about setting this up running Android 6.0, the app isn't compatible. I had to dig out my old Galaxy Note 2 and get that running again just so that I could perform the setup for this. It's also worth mentioning that, while I was able to get the app running on an older version of Android, the app was still garbage. Poorly optimized, and oftentimes clicking buttons left me wondering whether the app was loading or whether it had just crashed entirely. On the bright side, after the initial setup this has been working perfectly with my Amazon Echo. I had no significant issues getting my Echo to recognize this device, and now I'm able to turn on the plug-in lights in my dorm room by voice command. Always a hit when people come over to visit, and it's incredibly convenient. The unit itself is humongous and clunky. I plugged it into the top of my standard double outlet and the case extends down far enough that I'm struggling to plug anything into the bottom outlet. The bottom line about this unit is that it's functional (barely) and possibly worth it, but prepare to pull your hair out over setting it up and dealing with its minor annoyances. Hopefully there is a competent alternative in the future that is also compatible with Amazon Echo.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Doesn't work perfectly with Amazon Echo; easy setup,3.0 ,"Just got my switch. I have never used a switch like this before but it was pretty easy to setup and get working with my Echo (I used the iOS WeMo app on an iPad Air 2). I did wait 10 minutes while it said it updated the unit's firmware. So far I really like it! Hopefully it will keep working without issue.... only time will tell... but I was pleasantly surprised after all the negativity. It's working great, at least for now. I can now turn on and off my light by simply saying ""Alexa turn on the light"" or ""Alexa turn off the light"". Should anything change then I'll update this review (yes! see below). UPDATE 2015-10-18: I'm reducing my rating to 4 stars because sometimes when I tell Alexa to turn the light on or off she says ""OK"" but the light doesn't turn on or off. Asking the same thing again usually works but it's annoying. UPDATE 2015-12-01: Seems to be working much better after the last firmware update that fixed memory leaks and other stuff. I want another now to control the Christmas tree. UPDATE 2016-11-21: Downrating to 3 stars because I'm trying to setup some new switches and it is taking me way more time that it should due to bugs and quirks. Very frustrating.

Works great with Amazon Echo after Set up.,5.0 ,"This is not intuitive to set up. You absolutely MUST have a smart phone to select & enter the router password and then rename the device. WeMo Switch is the default name, and maybe Alexa didn't like the space, but would only turn it on and off half the time. We finally gave the switch a one word name and now it works fine. I don't have a smart phone so I had to use my nephews. There are other settings on the ap, like on & off at certain times & other choices. But I wanted it just controlled by the Echo, so you can give it an individual name and also include it in group names that include several WeMo products. My only complaint is the plug is large, and only orients in one direction, so it must be on the top of a dual plug socket & you can't use another large plug there.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

(01/05/16) Set it up in the afternoon, instructions that come with the switch leave much to be desired, lacking is an understatement. Took me a while to set it up properly but finally got it. Despite my efforts I could not get it to turn on my room air cleaners. They would turn off using the Android App and voice command with Alexa but would not turn on. My air cleaners have ELECTRONIC on/off switching. The Belkin web site states ""plug any device or appliance into the switch."" You can but it may not work. I then contacted Belkin using a chat support portal. The support person told me through his text reply's that these switches only work with MANUAL on/off switches. Not with ELECTRONIC on/off switches. Fact is most all modern electronics come with electronic switches. I can only imagine how many people have ordered these switches and spent time trying to figure out how to configure them, returning them in frustration or writing the cost off as a loss. The promotion of these switches by Belkin seems a bit deceptive to me. Yes I am unhappy with this switch, I saw it as a way to make my Amazon Dot more useful.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Nine hours and 40 reboots to set up three devices!,1.0 ,"I have seven of these switches. Four are the plugin type and three are the wall switches. The wall switches are pure crap and constantly loose there signal even when the WiFi signal is FULL strength! As bad as the hardware is, the software is even worse! I had previously installed two of the light switches and two of the plugin devices. The setup for the first four devices was very time consuming and I had many problems. The documentation is useless. The three devices I installed yesterday had so many problems that it took NINE HOURS to get them to run and this is after I had already set up the previous four so I know how these should operate and I have a lot of experience in setting them up. I have a very fast internet and WiFi connection and the firmware updates took hours!!! At one point I lost the connection to all of the devices. I had to cycle the power to various devices and during the nine hour period, I had to reboot my new iPhone 6 Plus over 40 times!!! The Belkin software is so poor that you need to reboot you phone over and over again to discover the devices. At this point, it is hit or miss as to the number of devices that will show up and I have never been able to get one of them to show up on my iPad. The concept is great and when they work they are great but I'll buy a different brand in the future!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Great If You Know Everything About Tech - Otherwise Avoid,2.0 ,"If you have very strong knowledge of how your router works with detailed ability of every how every setting works then go ahead and buy it. It's fun and works pretty good as long as everything is set up and working fine. The problems start whenever there is a (roughly quarterly) firmware update. When that happens, whatever you have plugged into this will no longer work. Lights? Won't work. Then you will be fumbling around in the dark trying to reconnect the switch with your wifi. More than likely you will spend more than an hour searching the web for solutions. After reading dozens of supposed fixes that don't work, you will have to contact their tech support. I've purchased two of these and they are far more trouble than any enjoyment and functionality they provide. Update - just spent over an hour with Belkin tech support. They couldn't figure out why the switch just stopped working and would not send a replacement.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I have again wasted no less than 3 hours of my time trying to set it up -- and on the phone with Wemo's customer service for over an hour and I STILL do not have my second device connected! (It took over 2 hours to get the first one connected!) As for the second device that gave me angst today, be aware that you can only use Wemo devices in one location. I happen to have an Alexa at my home and one at my studio (both Alexa devices work exceptionally well!), and ONE CELL PHONE. It seems as though Wemo's ""smart device"" cannot be connected to two different internet networks, even though it is two separate devices in two separate locations. In other words, it considers the cell phone the controlling device (not Alexa) and cannot be overridden. I am trashing this product and buying the competitor.

the user interface from hell. v2.0,4.0 ,"I wasted a half hour trying to get this to work. Maybe I can't read english; maybe I'm too old. I'll let my kids try before I turn this into a tire chock or use it for batting practice. I'd give it zero stars if I could. so i tried to get the wemo to work, and it would not. the online instructions were not helpful, and the unit's reliance on blinking lights make it like trying to have a meaningful conversation with an R2 unit. my review here got their attention (GOOD) and i spent about 40 minutes today with one of their tech support people. we did this, and we did that, repeatedly, and then he had the good sense to check my router settings. that turned out to be the problem. my router (asus) had its control channel set to AUTO, and the wemo does better when the control channel is static. of course, this was not in the online instructions. my comment amout their UI still stands, but them reaching out to me to sort this makes a huge difference in this customer's mind. their instructions need to be re-written, perhaps by a real tech writer. so, i will revise their stars to four, from zero, and had we not done this exercise, they would have gotten a five.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I am always amaze at these large companies allocate very little budget in ...,1.0 ,I am always amaze at these large companies allocate very little budget in making the product plug-n-play reliable but spend millions on packing and branding and yet no one in their own company test and used their own products. You would think Belkin could design a wireless switch to turn on/off reliably. Take a note of all the negative reviews and either include some detail trouble shooting instructions or pull the product off the shelf. Belkin makes simple instructions to a device that does NOT simply work out of the box. Wemo Switch came with only iconic instructions with less than a dozens words on it. There are two push buttons on the device with no mention to them on any packaging or instructions. Like the buttons there is a multi-color LED with no information either. Why put on push buttons and multicolor LED if you are not going to even describe what they are used for? I discovered the Wemo on my WiFi network and worked fine with iOS device but when I went to use it with another device the Wemo no longer broadcast its network. I started to guess maybe you have to push on of the two buttons or put it into another state. Unplug power to it and reapplied power. Instead of wasting more time guessing on how to trouble shoot the product I felt my time was worth more posting a review. I thought it would be better to use a red color button indication when power is applied to the switch using the smart phone application instead of green on the display. I did not even bother installing the Wemo light switch after the outlet switch unit did not work as advertised. Talking to my fellow co-worker he said the RF connection is probably flaky because of its antenna design mounted inside an electrical box surrounded with wires. Also Belkin software app programmers must have written a bunch of spaghetti code for an application so simple is 60MB in size to turn on/off a switch. I saw other users posting the same problems with the unit stops broadcasting its network with no clear fix.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Needs better input sanitation for wifi passwords.,1.0 ,"This is a product that needs better code. My wifi password is a randomly generated string that contains 20 characters in length and uses all 62 alphanumeric characters with an additional 32 special characters (everything a keyboard has to offer for a total of 20^96 possible combinations).

so it's really annoying because every time it turns off,2.0 ,"Bought two of these. One appears to work normal although sometimes it's laggy when used with Alexa. The other one keeps turning off by itself for no reason. And that's the one that's used for my Dish Receiver, so it's really annoying because every time it turns off, the Dish takes about 5-10 minutes to re-connect to the satellites and download the program. Also I have it programmed to go on and off at certain times and it seems like that is buggy as well. Sometimes it adheres close to the time, sometimes it doesn't. One works; one is really glitchy so that's pretty bad quality control by my book.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

The Jetson's Have Arrived! (Great basic home automation to be had),4.0 ,"If you own a Smartphone or the Amazon Echo, these devices allow some great automation in the form of turning things on and off. After plugging this in, downloading the app to my Android phone, I was up and running in about 2 minutes. I went to the Echo app and grouped this to the Living room. it was as easy as telling Alexa (Amazon Echo) to turn on/turn off the Living Room lights! Worked perfectly. PROS: - Easy to install and configure - Easy to group devices to control sections or areas - No fluff; simple and worked with the Amazon Echo CONS: - Pretty pricey! That was my only complaint. I like the device, it worked flawlessly with the Echo I just purchased and I am excited to do some home automation! But if you add up the costs, each room can easily go over $100+. I had to be very selective in what device in what room I opted to configure this. For a couple of lights and switches here and there around a small home, it's not a big deal. Otherwise, figure this into your overall budget.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"While there were many whiny review, I took a shot.",5.0 ,"Well, I am quite a nerd. I want to have a house that can be fully controlled using my iphone. This Belkin WeMo Switch was the next step. I could read many people saying that it would brick, or that the connectivity would not work etc.... But Amazon decreases the price to 40, and with an additional free $10 gift card, it was the best time to go and try this switch. Well, it took me less than 5 minutes to sync the belkin to my wifi router (you first need to download the app, then go to wifi and connect to the wemo - NOT your router, then go to the app and do the adjustment). It WORKS. That's all. I don't know why many people have issues, because it was very very easy. Also I have some issues with wifi and the belkin still get it. The switch is very responsive via WIFI, and a little less via 3G (remote) - like 1 second lag. IFTTT works great too. For example, you can create a rule to blink your lights when your favorite sport team will start a game. Or, more effectively, when you arrive to your place (using GPS). I love this device and purchased two more.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Totally disappointed and returned,1.0 ,"Ordered this as my first home automation foray and couldn't get it to work at all. iOS devices would see the Belkin network but it would refuse to connect to my home wifi network. I tried resetting the switch, unplugging and plugging it back into a wall socket, deleting and reinstalling the iOS application, all in different order and combinations. I received a reply from Belkin customer service who advised me to try a different approach which did not work either. After spending several hours trying to get the switch to work, I gave up in frustration and returned the product. My take: Not ready for prime time as there is no guarantee this will work with a variety home networks. Some have had success but my experience will keep me from purchasing anything in the WeMo line until I hear of a better all around approach by reviewers. The only pro to my experience was the easy return policy by Amazon.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

App makes this switch a pain to deal with,2.0 ,"The plug itself might be okay and when it is paired, it does work well. But the number of problems with it meant I had to return it. 1. Pairing is extremely painful and unreliable. For starters, the app for some reason kept looking for the plug on my cellular 3G connection, obviously not finding any plug there, instead of the WeMo switches own Wi-Fi network which I was connected to. After I turned off cellular data on my phone, it finally decided to use the Wemo switch Wi-Fi and discovered the switch. The entire process was punctuated every few seconds by the app just hanging during discovery or Wi-Fi connection. 2. I had two of these switches and one of the switch was just never discovered at all or paired. 3. The switch that did pair kept losing its connection every few days making the home automation unreliable. I think all of these problems really stem from a poorly written Android app which definitely hangs if you have to go to another app in the middle of the process and switched back to it, but even if you stay on the app, it will eventually hang. When working, the switch works beautifully. The away mode is nicely done and the switch is operable remotely. But the setup and constant disconnects meant I had to give this up. I researched some more and ended up buying the TP-LINK Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa which while having some problems of its own paired without problems and works very nicely.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Can't add (already set up) devices when remote makes this product worthless,1.0 ,"I really wanted to like this product. I keep a Slingbox set up attached to a cable box at my parents's house, as I tend to travel around a bit and don't want to pay for another TV service at my own apartment. Since my slingbox is rather old, it tends to lock up at times and require a power cycle to get back in a working state. So I bought this as it was cheaper than most other network-control power switches on the market and seemed pretty simple to set up and use. It worked great, exactly as I was hoping, for the first month or so. It was pretty simple to set up, and worked flawlessly whenever I needed to use it. However after a month or two of use, it suddenly stopped working. Trying to do anything in the wemo app didn't respond, so I was SOL regarding trying to use my device. Eventually when I got back to my parents house, even on the local network the device wouldn't work. I ended up having to do a manual factory reset of the device in order to get it back and usable. After the factory reset, it worked fine. However, my biggest complaint, is the Wemo app's lack of having any form of account management. I'm currently nowhere near my parents house, and my phone died so I had to get a new one. With my new phone, when I installed the Wemo app, theres no way for me to recover my old list of devices. The only thing the app lets me do is add new devices connected to my local network. However since I'm nowhere near my Wemo switch, that is impossible, and so I'm once again without access to controlling my device. If they added the ability to recover our devices remotely, this review would instantly go back to a 4 star review. For a device that's intended purpose it to allow you to control it from anywhere in the world, not having a way of re-setting up access to it when remote is a huge flaw in their design. TLDR: device works well enough, however the lack of ability to setup/add your WeMo switch on a new device unless you're physically at the device is a huge design flaw that keeps this device from being useful.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

stopped working,2.0 ,"1 month later it would no longer connect to my wifi. Tried resetting and it just doesnt work anymore. Dont waste your money. UPDATE: This device works ok however the app that comes with it is not very user friendly. Unfortunately, this device is nothing more than a glorified wifi switch without a good app to go with it. I have figured out after hours of trial and error that you need to disable remote settings and all that nonsense from all your devices that use it. (not an easy task if you set it up with multiple devices) There should be a master reset option instead of these things. I tried using the help on the app without getting any either. I have tried this both on an iPhone and an android phone. They are equally difficult to manage and maintain. Sometimes the remote access feature does not work for me at all so I would have to be in the wifi network to use it. I think a lot of improvement is needed for this device to be useful at all. I'm leaving this with a 1 star review because all it's done so far is annoy me with multiple unintelligent settings and terrible re-setup. Update 2016: Other than a 5ghz wifi band incompatibility, after it is set up, it works very well with Amazon echo. I am bumping this up to 2 star because the app still isn't good with it but is functional and very convenient with echo.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

This product is laughably bad.,1.0 ,"What a great idea. What poor, poor execution. These bad boys went on sale so I picked up three. Right off the bat, it took me about 2 hours to set up the 3. The Android App struggled with connecting to the actual product, to the wifi, and really... just about everything. Once I finally got them up and running I find that for some reason when I'm within my network I cannot see the names I set for my WeMo's. In fact, I can't do anything but turn them off and on from within my network. I try to contact support and they tell me I should try some generic reset everything technique that sounded like a canned response. So I download the older beta app and finally I can see what I'm actually turning on and turning off. Funny that an app that is about 6 month older works better than the new one right? Well today they just stop working. So now I have no choice but to try reset them. This is where it gets bad. It takes 10 to 20 tries just to use the physical button on the device to reset them. Tie that in with the usual unable to actually set up anything correctly app and I'm 4 hours in and only one is actually setup. One. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Not in it's current form. I think the Android App is most to blame. The app unbelievably deficient, slow, and just doesn't work most the time. I would return these if I wasn't so head hard and intent on making them work for me. But please whatever you do, save yourself the pain.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

The reaction time of the Works absolutely seamlessly with the Amazon Echo (Alexa). They need to add dimming.,3.0 ,"Had some issues finding a compatible version of Android to configure this with (Android N beta would not work. Android 4.3 worked. I haven't tried setting one up since N has been officially released). Once set up, the app works well for what it is. It provides quick accessibility to the on/off feature of the switch. The reaction time of the switch to app commands is fantastic. Works absolutely seamlessly with the Amazon Echo (Alexa)! Easy to add to Echo, easy to control the switch with voice control. No additional trigger words needed, just direct voice commands. The scheduling is nice, but I wish I could set up a random On/Off sequence for the times where I am away from the home for extended periods. This is a minor complaint though. A bigger issue is no support for dimming a lamp. I get that there is a little added cost and complexity from adding dimming, but at this price point this feature is expected. Once this feature is added, I'm buying one of these for every outlet in my home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"When a product fails at its primary purpose, it is useless.",1.0 ,"LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT SWITCH!!!!!!! These are terrible. I bought three of them. I started with two. The set-up was not as easy as it should be. One of them took five tries to get it set up. The App is awful...it is confusing and difficult to figure out how to assign, share, and configure rules. I consider myself to be more than moderately tech savvy. If you are not that, then I would imagine setting this up and working the App would be near impossible. OK, so I get the first two set up and they are working fairly well at first, so I buy a third one. With the experience of setting the first two up, this one was slightly less difficult to set-up, but still not as easy as it should be. Almost immediately, the third one would go on and off randomly during its scheduled time to be on. Maybe resetting it and starting over may have solved this, but the set-up is so painful on these that I never did it. I guess they recently did an update of the firmware on these and, after that, now, none of the lights turn poff. They turn on when scheduled, but they do not shut off. So, I took the irritating, frustrating and painful time to reset all three of the switches. Guess what, they still do not turn off. I awoke the next morning to all three lights being on. I am not sure if the resetting has or has not fixed the random on/off of the third one as I really didn't pay attention and I just did this all yesterday. I think the worst part of this is the seeming indifference of Wemo to even acknowledge this. A quick check online shows that this is a common issue with Wemo owners all over for sometime. Some people who have contacted Wemo state that Wemo gives them some form of ""It is not us, it is you"" response. I will give it this: It does interact with the Echo well and I do enjoy that aspect. But, that is a secondary reason I bought these. Certainly, a reason, but the main reason I have these is to turn lights on and off. If they do not do that reliably, then I consider them useless. The sad thing is (well, it should be sad for Wemo) that I was just getting ready to buy 2 or 3 more of these. Again, I am a fairly competent person with tech stuff. I can set-up almost anything, even more complicated household installations, so I can say with certainty it is not me, it is them. I will be looking for a different brand. DO NOT BUY WEMO.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I was worried as there were a lot of one star reviews. I thought I'd give it a try. Well, at least in my home it is impossible to configure. I have two WiFi access ports. My main one is from one of the new Apple Extreme 802.ac Airports and the other is an ASUS router running Tomato software. The ASUS supports up to 802.n. Neither of my WiFi devices could communicate and set up the device. I googled around a bit to see what was needed but in the end this is just plain ridiculous. I designed and built computers for 20 some years and really understand networking. This thing is a joke. DON'T buy it. Amazon was great and accepted my return. I'm getting a Z-Wave device next.

Works but not sure if my phone's Wifi connection is less secure now because of the WeMo,4.0 ,I'm no tech wizard so please don't hold my ignorance against me. I was unsure if this was going to work for my room based on some of the online reviews but overall I'm glad I bought this because it did exactly what I needed it to do which was create a remote controlled light. I had a plug located in an inconvenient location and it made it difficult to use the light switch on the wall to turn the lights on and off in my room. Thanks to the WeMo I only had to worry about plugging in my lamp once and I never had to touch the light switch on the wall again! One thing that I'm not really comfortable with is that the WeMo set up required that I route the Wifi connection of my smartphone through the WeMo app/software versus connecting my phone directly to my home Wifi like it used to be before the WeMo. Now when I use my phone at home to browse the web I get constant error messages stating that my phone is NOT connected to the Internet. Maybe I made a mistake during set up but it's really annoying and somewhat unsettling to think my connection may be compromised.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Easy to set rules/timers dependent on the sun or not. This one controls a black light plugged into outlet the other controls under cabinet lights. I have swapped them around occasionally if one of my kids gets sick and needs a humidifier in the room while they sleep. This way I can put it on as they sleep so the humidifier doesn't stay on longer than the manual says and I don't have to wake up and go into the the room to turn it off. I wish I could have the same review about their other unit that can control light bulbs from Cree, but unfortunately not. That unit I got from them no longer works, and the only way to buy another to replace it is to get the whole kit (including garbage Philips bulbs) all over again.

Frustrated trying to add device...,1.0 ,"I have one of these plugs set up at another home along with a webcam, but I've been totally frustrated trying to add a new device at my current location. When I go to add a new device through the app it tells me ""Let's get started...plug it in."" I do that and the app just sits there like it doesn't recognize the device, which is blinking. I then go to settings and wifi and click on the wemo wifi setting. It connects and when I go back to the app, I name the device and continue, and the app reconnects to my local wifi setting. The app then says ""Success, you can begin using the device"" but right after that the light goes off on the device and the app doesn't recognize it. I try again to go through this process and the wemo wifi network will say ""not in range"" even though I'm a few feet from the router. I returned one unit figuring it was defective but the new unit is doing the same thing, so it has to be the app. Can the app not handle devices in two different homes and under different local networks? Frustrating beyond belief and the Belkin help desk is a waste of time.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Belkin WeMo Switch....Good for target practice only!,1.0 ,"Of the almost 40 iOt and home automation devices, sensors, hubs and platforms that I have used tested and integrated into my home, the WeMo Switch was alway's the first to fail. Quite possibly the worst home automation product I have ever owned. Consistent at one thing, going offline and you can be guaranteed, that when you do a firmware update, you'll have to reset the device, any schedules you had, and any integrations with products like smartthings. Since it is WiFi based only and has no real local functional reliability(it needs cloud integration to automate with other non Belkin sensors), it will consistently fail when you have daylight saving's transitions, firmware upgrades, power outages, or any internet/home networking interruptions. One would expect some level of redundancy so that during any of those events, it could revert to last known settings, or through battery backup, non volatile memory, etc... provide a little redundancy, but it doesn't! It is good however for target practice. ;)","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

it's great..,1.0 ,"When it wants to work, it's great... but the Belkin WeMo Switch is like a difficult child that doesn't want to eat it's broccoli. If you change your wifi password or connection, it freaks out and does not want to cooperate. It takes me up to an hour to try to calm it down and coax it out of it's stubborn ways. Even still, it won't cooperate. I'll patiently sit down with it for an hour for up to a week until it's ready to pair with my phone. It always asks you to update the firmware, which almost always makes it worse. I've purchased 2 (I bought one for my parents, but I guess they were too tech unsavvy to have confidence to try to break the beast). I bought one (not knowing how crappy it was) and have been devastatingly frustrated with it since.

Not a fan,2.0 ,"I love the ability to turn on my lights when I am not home as well as program the timers in a much way than the old fashion timers so when I saw the WeMo Switch I was excited to try it. Sad to say we hated this switch and here's why: - It can only be controlled by one device. Because my husband set this up on his phone (which he said set up was pretty easy) I was unable to control it on mine. I always had to use his phone when I wanted to do anything with it. - It functioned fine for a bit and then randomly the lights started turning on and off every 10 minutes by themselves, annoying.

I love the idea but not happy with the product being able to stay configured. I have a friend that has several and went to help him after an hr or so with the support we had to give up too. He still does not have his working either. I gave one as a gift and they can not get it reconfigured.

Alexa wanted nothing to do with this thing...,1.0 ,"This thing is absolute junk (WeMo Switch, probably all of these also). Backwards engineering, ridiculous ideas on how IFTTT should bend around them...plus Alexa hates it. As in The Echo didn't find it, didn't want to find it, and preferred to not integrate and have its circuitry mixed up, touched, synchronized or associated with this thing. Please don't think I'm just here to bash this item, as I'm not. In fact, I can't remember the last time I wrote a review, but this thing pi$$ed me off so much I thought I'd possibly save someone else the headache. The setup process is beyond logic, as in you have to download their app, install it on your phone using WiFi, then disconnect, use their network being broadcast from the switch to get it registered to the app, then switch back to WiFi and complete the process. I was able to get the switch to turn on and off from the app, but not with Alexa...which was the main reason for getting this, nor was I able to use it from my phone using the cellular network (and yes, I had a signal and was able to use other apps)...only on WiFi. The thing also seemed a bit warm for my tastes, and it took up too much of the plug to be able to effectively use the other outlet. Look, I wanted to like this and I wanted to use it...but it just doesn't do or live up to anything close to what it says it can or eludes to being able to do. Without sounding conceited...I am pretty competent when it comes to electronics and technology, so I knew what I was doing. But this thing is just a joke, and I guess I should've known better than to trust Belkin, as I have never thought too much of their products before and even less now. Researching through the so called ""help"" they have posted and listed throughout the Internet just shows the lack of support or care, because I obviously wasn't the first person to have any of these problems. I already requested a return, and will be shipping it back tomorrow...I can get my money back, but not the time I wasted on this. Don't do what I did, look for something else...which is what I will be doing. Mike","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Don't change your router!,1.0 ,"This worked well for a little bit. I was having trouble with my internet (my provider). While trying to get my internet speed working correctly, I updated the firmware on my router and had shut it down to reboot a couple times. As soon as I had done that, my WeMo Switch quit working. The app couldn't find the device and the switch just flashed orange. I tried the tech support web sight and the web sight came up blank. Not kidding... nothing. so I went back to amazon and read the reviews. That helped. I deleted the app on my phone and then reinstalled the app. I powered down the WeMo (unplugged), I then held the reset switch while plugging it back in. I went through the setup process again and found the WeMo network again to connect to the app. The app pulled up and found it and connected, but it would not set up the remote connection (failed). I thought it was going to work though and I was back up and running, but then it started flashing orange again. The app couldn't find the WeMo again. So... I give up. I feel frustrated and like I wasted 40 bucks! DO NOT power down or change your router in any way! You will screw everything up.

Continuously loses WiFi connectivity rendering it useless,1.0 ,"I bought two of these in hopes of controlling two wall-plug track lights in my living room. Set-up was relatively easy using the WeMo app for IOS (I tried on my Android and it failed to control either device when associated with its own wireless network). I had to configure a 2.4Ghz network on my access point (I only broadcasted in 5Ghz, but these things don't support 5Ghz). The deal break for me with these is how inconsistent they work with my Amazon Echo. I configured the Echo to control the two so I could turn my lights on and off via voice command. They constantly lose connection to my network and as a result, the Echo can't communicate and control them. I set reservations for them on my router so they always picked up the same IP and setting a continuous ping to them revealed how they lost and regained access to my WiFi randomly. I have no other device on my network that does this. I wish it worked reliably, when it does work, it's great, but for the great majority of the time, they simply don't work.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I bought one Wemo smart plug and one Orvibo smart plug in hope that ...,1.0 ,"I bought one Wemo smart plug and one Orvibo smart plug in hope that highly rated Wemo would provide reliability and easy-to-use experience and use it at some critical places while use much cheaper Orvibo at not so critical places. After going through initial setup and few hours of usage, the result is quite different from what I expected. The setup process on Wemo is confusing and took longer time. Once all set, I got disconnected from the device many times. And the worst of all, sometimes when I flip the switches on my smartphone, the app indicates the switch is on but in reality, it is off. The setup for Orvibo is easy and straight forward, I never get connection problems and it works reliably. I tried with Wifi connection and LTE connection, manual switch and timer, all worked as expected. I have returned Wemo and ordered another Orvibo.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Doesn't seem so smart...,1.0 ,"I'm really unhappy with this switch. Setting it up was fussy and took way longer than it should have taken. After only 24 hours of use, the switch shows up as unrecognized, I think that's the term, on my WeMo app. I've refreshed and it showed up momentarily. The WeMo app has downloaded new software, but still certainly not working ""seamlessly"" as advertised. My Echos don't recognize it even though it's hooked into my network and that bothers me the most. Stupidly I put our Christmas tree lights on the switch, but I'm thinking about trying something much less important. I can see that if it worked properly it would be amazing! Maybe another brand of smart plug in is my future.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Not ready for release,1.0 ,"To begin with, the WeMo switch isn't a sufficiently robust player in the WiFi world. Plugged into an outlet in a room with a strong network signal (according to four cell phones, two laptops, and a signal strength meter) the WeMo continually faded in and out of availability, as if Faraday's ghost were wandering between me and the switch. If I have to spend a couple of minutes rediscovering switches every time I run the WeMo app, I might just as well use the time to walk into the room where the light is. And that's after the mandatory (you're asked if you want it, but it doesn't matter what you pick) software upgrade, which takes so long I expected to see the code delivered by a telegram messenger on my front porch. But even if the hardware were reliable... the WeMo app (for Android) was shipped before it was finished. Not just before QA, mind you, which would have put on brakes had it happened at all, but before the design was done. The UX designer was evidently my next-door neighbor's feeble-minded golden retriever*. Edit the device name? Go ahead, but by the way you'll always see the factory default, so change it as often as you like. Specify a programmed ON-time? Have at it -- we assume you'll never want to turn it OFF, isn't that right? Turn ON at dusk? Fine, but we'll define dusk not by light but by a forecast for your city... provided that you live in a place of our choice (state capitals and populous cities omitted at random -- have a map handy). Fun idea but this product is *not* ready to ship. * I take that back about the dog. Dogs are color-blind, so the UI might have been more accessible if actually canine-designed.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Do not recommend. Quality not great. Belkin offers no support.,2.0 ,"I ordered two of these as I was very excited to control lights in my home while out of town. Unfortunately, I have had bad luck with this product. In the 2 1/2 months that I've had these switches, one worked half of the time, but luckily now seems to be functioning if I do not change settings or anything at all. The other has completely stopped working. The light flashes RED. Belkin insists there is only a GREEN or AMBER light and offers no support unless you pay for it.

"Maybe mine is a defect, but it just does not work",1.0 ,"Even finding the poor documentation on the setup procedure and getting it to project it's wifi, I have not gotten through the setup. To get the wifi back on after it defaults to switch only mode, you have to plug in the device while holding the reset, and then after a few seconds, let go and hold it again. This will get the light to alternate between blue and orange and you might see the wifi on your phone or laptop. I say might because this connectable phase lasts about 30 seconds, but during this time the network flickers on and off. I got into the app while connected and even got to the password for my home network once, but was never able to complete the setup without the signal going dead for a second and disconnecting my phone. I am disappointed, at least I can return it easily enough.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

This product never worked on any device or in any situation. Stay away.,1.0 ,"I've used quite a few home automation products, Nest, GE Link, Logitech Harmony, even a WeMo crock pot and some are easier to use than others... This however simply did not work. I tried numerous outlets, Android and iOS devices, and even the direct connect vs a wifi router and the device never connected. When it would connect it never worked long enough for me to choose any settings or actually use it. I returned mine for a refund. Belkin sucked over a decade ago when I worked at Best Buy, and apparently they still suck now. The app was some awfully-made web interface, not even a native app, and the instructions on how to use it require you to switch between a web page and the app constantly, but when you leave the app, it abandons the setup procedure. Stay away. I'll update this review if I can find a better working switch.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Great product on paper that doesn't work in reality,1.0 ,"On paper this is 1 of the best smart switches, I especially liked the integration with Alexa and IFTTT, but unfortunately this is a seriously flawed product because of its unreliability. I got this switch to work the first time successfully, then tried to move it, and it never worked again, even after half a dozen resets. Technical support was unable to resolve the issue, and in the end wanted me to make all kinds of changes to my network that shouldn't have anything to do with the connectivity problems: changing the channel of the 2.4Ghz band that my routers were transmitting on, and disabling the security. My suspicion is that they hacked this product together by a team unrelated to the router team, or it was through an acquisition, how else can you explain a renowned Wi-Fi router producer that can't produce a reliable, easy to use connected smart switch? Even when it worked the first time it took way too long to connect the phone to the switch and then set it up inside the Wi-Fi network - all signs of bad product development. In short, believe the 1-star reviews this time and don't snooker yourself buying half a dozen of these and be stuck with bricks after a few months. I'm switching to TP-Link, even though they don't have IFTTT integration yet...","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

It went through two series of firmware updates. I then ""discovered"" it on the Echo, then took it out side and plugged in at the place I wanted to use it. I went back up to the house and tried turning it on using the We-Mo app and it worked! Lastly, I said ""Alexa, Pool Lights On"" and voila! Let there be light! I will now try to figure out a way to protect it from the outdoor elements, but suffice it to say, it worked as advertised and instructions were easy to follow.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Literally worse than useless.,1.0 ,I should have listened to the other reviewers - fortunately I can return it. It took some doing to get this set up. You need to connect the phone to the WeMo's own wifi network and from there you enter your home WiFi info. Problem is that my phone (Galaxy S3) always scans for the best network so after a minute or so it would revert to my home network. I found a work around for that and got it to work! Feeling slightly smug with this small victory I headed out for some errands. I glanced at my phone and noticed the 4G symbol wasn't there (nor was the 3g). After lots of resets and experimentation I realized that for some reason the WeMo software is preventing my phone from connecting to the data network. I took the software off and the 4G came back. I really wanted the WeMo switch to work so I reinstalled the software to give it a second chance. Same result. I'm printing up my return label now :-/,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT,1.0 ,"This product is horrible. I bought it to work with the amazon echo. It worked for one day and stopped communicating with my wifi network. I've been in IT for over 10 years, so my technical understanding is very high. After resetting the device multiple times and performing troubleshooting, I contacted Belkin customer support via chat on their site. The tech continuously asked me questions that I had literally just answered (in text), over and over again. I got the impression he was just trying to waste time so I would give up. I contacted support the next day, the tech says they reviewed the previous conversation, but that they had to run through all the same troubleshooting a second time, despite confirming that they read all the troubleshooting. Long story short, this is a crappy product backed by even worse support. Belkin has never been a good company, and nothing has changed.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

They seem to only work properly for a short amount of time before being borderline useless. I purchased two of these outlet swit,1.0 ,"I have always had problems with Belkin products. They seem to only work properly for a short amount of time before being borderline useless. I purchased two of these outlet switches with the intention of being able to control the connected devices (my computer monitors) via either the Amazon Echo, or my SmartThings hub. For a time, it works great with no issues, but then either a firmware update will come out, or it just will not be detected by Echo or ST anymore. I will add that anytime I pull up the app, the switch always shows up, and can be controlled manually just fine. For me though, the whole point of getting all these smart home devices was so I would not need to be tethered to my phone or tablet to control them. If you're one of those people that can't walk 2 feet anywhere without your phone in your hand, I suppose this will not be an issue. If you're ok with not having ST connectivity, get the TP-Link switch instead. Installation was a breeze by comparison, and my Echo discovered it right away. I believe the TP-Link does not have the correct frequency to connect to ST, but if the alternative is a switch that only works some of the time, it's relatively the same thing to me. Don't support poor hardware, and cumbersome software.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Then it popped up like I’d been successful on the reinstall before,1.0 ,"First the WeMo app would not download and install. Took several attempts.

So I had to ‘forget’ that WeMo Wi-Fi network (more on that later). Next I uninstalled the WeMo app and tried to reinstall it but I was unsuccessful. So I rebooted my iPod Touch.

Very unreliable - Avoid at all costs,1.0 ,I really liked the idea of this switch and bought two of them in December. One of them would only work when in the same room as the router (Orange flashing light with anything more than 10 feet from the router). I returned this one. The second had a better range and worked in a room about 40 feet from the router. The set up was Ok but it required a software update on the switch. I went away and set up a schedule for the switch. For about a week everything worked perfectly. After a week it stopped working and I get a flashing orange light. In the mean time my wife threw away the packaging and so I was forced to call Belkin to try to arrange for a replacement. I have just spent about 40 minutes on the phone resetting the switch and trying to get it to work. After this first call they would not let me return it but have authorized a higher level support person to call me within 48 hours to try some other things. Painful. Painful.

Good product,5.0 ,I like the switch and it works as advertised. My only gripe is that we moved the switch and I could not figure out in the WEMO app. how to change the name of the switch. I did a search on their site and could not find the answer so I had to call in and it took like 30 plus minutes after being transferred around before I could get someone to show me how to change the name of the switch from bedroom to living room.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Just doesn't work,1.0 ,"This product is absolute junk. I'm on a Verizon network in a major metro area (i.e., no connectivity issues), and I've never had a product linking all kinds of smart devices to my router. The WeMo Smartplug linked ONCE, dropped the connection, and I've never been able to link it again. Have tried every trouble shooting strategy listed, and nothing. Can't remember the last time I ordered a product that just doesn't work...","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

This has got to be the worst functioning piece of crap I have ever set eyes ...,1.0 ,"This has got to be the worst functioning piece of crap I have ever set eyes on. There was a time when Belkin actually made quality products, so this is extremely disappointing. The switch will manually cut on and off just fine, but the purpose of a wifi switch is to be able to control it remotely, which it fails miserably. It will not connect to the network, the app will not find the device, and Amazon needs to be reamed for even considering suggesting this as a product compatible for the Echo. If the app can't find it, Echo can't either. Do not waste your time or money on this product and the ""supporting"" unbelievably poor app. Find another manufacturer with a comparable product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Price point, App, easy setup",5.0 ,"Great price and product compared to the other brands. Purchased two of these after comparing and reviewing other styles and brands. this one doesn't need a hub, just your home wifi and an iphone or android. I use 3 of these for different lights and lamps without interruption. Can even use these from outside the home and off the wifi. Great price! didn't really need to get the other insight model and saved a few bucks!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Works great, but steep learning curve.",4.0 ,"This unit took a loot of time to get used to, programming. Eventually, I got the hang of it, and the 2 units I have are working fine. One does a light, the other a battery charger that comes on for one afternoon a week. I once tried to check the status from my Android phone, away from home and not on local WiFi. Totally screwed the programming, so I will not do that again. That is why I rate the unit 4 stars.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works Great! Wish it was smaller - way too big for what it is,4.0 ,"This is not my first foray into WeMo products, so I was familiar with the quick and easy setup. I do prefer the Insight switch over this Smart Plug primarily because this WeMo Switch feels like there is a lot of wasted plastic. The WeMo Insight Switch - while more expensive - has a much smaller and more aesthetically pleasing footprint. Setup is easy as long as your device finds your wireless network - that seems to be the biggest struggle and it took a while for it to find the network. I wish there was a better way to set these up - let me access the Switch to select which network and put in a key - instead of having to depend on the device just ""finding"" the right network. There is not enough feedback on how the setup/network connection is going in my opinion. I love the options the WeMo app gives you - turn on at sunset, off at a pre-defined time - it's great. The Alexa-enabled voice control is also excellent and has simplified a lot of things in our house. I also have a WeMo Insight Switch and a TP-Link smart switch. The TP-Link and this are very similar, but the TP-Link is cheaper. I use both and both are Alexa-enabled, so both are a good step toward a Smart Home environment.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Fabulous system,5.0 ,The system has been easy to install and works like a charm. I now have lights that turn on and off automatically as well as the capability for individual switching through an app on my iPhone.

Great little device especially when paired with my Echo,5.0 ,"Bought an Echo about a month ago and then bought one of these to see if they worked. Well I am now going to buy another one. Setup was fairly simple although for some reason while trying to update the firmware when I first connected to it, it lost connection with the WiFi network and then failed. A couple of days later I reset it and it connected again. Firmware updated without issue this time and I could control it from my phone. Excellent. Went into the Echo setup and told it to search for devices, found the device on the first shot and I can now tell Alexa to turn on/off the light I plugged in. Awesome! Only downside so far is I did not see the WeMo app for the iPad only the iPhone, No big deal but it would be nice. Now all I have to do is wait for Alexa to become self-aware and take over my house😉","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Control electronics with your smartphone!,5.0 ,"The Belkin WeMo Switch is very easy to setup and program. I use three of them in my home to control some lamps and have been very happy with them.

Emits high pitched noise,1.0 ,"The brand new unit emitted a loud high pitched noise when plugged in. A little trouble connecting, but it didn't matter since this one was obviously defective. Spend hours going through the customer service for Belkin. Wow, that is quite an ordeal for a small item. Finally was able to get a replacement unit after sending the first one to them. This one also makes a noise. Not quite as bad as the first, but no way you could put this in a quite room. Maybe the newer unit is better quality. I can't even imagine going through the return process again.

Randomly powering off 6 times in 2 weeks,1.0 ,"I connected my servers to the device, so that I can remotely reboot my machines in case of failures. However, in the two weeks after I configured the WeMo switch, it randomly disconnected the power for six times. I did not have any rules set up, nor did I have any problems with the wireless connection -- the switch was simply turned off, without any warnings, at random times. This is frustrating, especially given that my machines run important jobs.

I tried using both the iOS and Android apps. Both freeze, crash, and slow to a crawl at best.

Good but...,4.0 ,"Its great if it works but has limitations: I had to return the first one but the replacement was fine. The smart phone application is limited. You cant migrate the application to another device with physically being with the WeMo device. Not a big deal if in your home, but a pain if a holiday home miles away.

"So incredibly terrible, and completely unusable.",1.0 ,"I wanted to like this product. I really liked the hub-less idea. But, my user experience over the past 24 hours has been dismal. I'd recommend the old X10 stuff before I'd recommend this. The first thing you need to do is get these moved from their own little network into your home's network. To do this, you need to download their Android (or IOS) app. The number of permissions that are requested by the app are stunning and disturbing. They attempt to justify them, but what really comes out after you look around a bit is that they are completely unfamiliar with Android development. Get comfortable with the innards of your phone, because never before have you had to become so accustomed to your phone's force-stop features. The app doesn't crash, per se, but it spends most of its time in a drugged-out haze trying to remember the state of the world, and the support documents recommend uninstalling, reinstalling, force-stopping, and all kinds of other indications of an app gone seriously, seriously, wrong. But at least at this point, you've got lights turning on and off. But it all gets so much worse once it asks for a firmware update. The devices ship with an ancient firmware, such that it appears to take multiple steps to get them up to the right levels. And each of those levels is a nigh insurmountable task. It starts easy enough: you just click the little upgrade button on the app. That's when the blinking starts. The blinking, oh god, the blinking. First it blinks blue. Then green? Or is that amber? Then it turns off. Then it is blue again. Then it is off. Then it sits and blinks amber for hours. The documentation tells you that this means that it is unable to connect to your network. This is odd, since the on/off buttons still seem to function. Until, they too stop responding. And then they disappear from the network entirely. So you're left with the one thing you've been told to NEVER DO WHEN UPDATING FIRMWARE... you power cycle it. And it comes back up, maybe. Maybe you need to reset it. Maybe not. But you *might* get it to show back up in the app, after force-closing and uninstalling and reinstalling it. But you'll only discover that all those blinking lights were nothing by a lie, for it is still stuck at the original firmware version, the blinking lights now won't stop at all, and you're beginning to think that saving the boxes was a prescient move on your part. After hours of fidgeting with this, I'm left thinking that my time is not worth this, and these devices need to go, not back to the factory, but to some third-world electronics recycling fire, where at least the device's burning corpse will keep a poor family warm for the night. If they're able to sleep through all the blinking, that is. --- Edit: After continued misery with tech support, they were returned today. Just in case it will save you time when you have to call them, here's the script from the support people: 1. What is the brand and model of wireless router? 2. Did you reset the WEMO switches by holding the restore button for 15 seconds without the power and then plug in the WEMO switch and still holding the restore button for another 15 seconds? 3. Have you tried using different handheld devices in running upgrade? 4. How far are the WEMO switches from the router? 5. Have you tried changing the wireless channels of your router and used 1, 3, 6, 9, 11? 6. Did you clear cache or clear data on your Android smart device? 7. Are you able to disable and enable remote access without any errors? 8. Are the WEMO rules created being followed? After answering those questions, these came back: 1. Please change the wireless channel of your router and used 1 or 9. 2. Make sure the 2.4 Ghz SSID wireless name is not the same 5 Ghz SSID 3. Check if the UPNP is enabled on your router. 4. Ensure to disable IGMP, VLAN, VPN are other advanced security on the router. 5. Port forward or port trigger ports on your router: 3475, 3478, 5228, 8080, and 8443. Nevermind that you can only forward one port to one switch... 6. Disable/enable remote access on WEMO app. 7. Disable mobile data and connect to 2.4 Ghz network and run firmware update. I don't even know what this means! 8. Lastly, disable router firewall temporarily to allow firmware update of WEMO to go through.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Single-Network Use ONLY!,4.0 ,"I bought two of these, thinking that if I liked how they work I'd buy several more. I planned to use them at my work and at home. They were pretty easy to set up and worked great at home. I took one to work and did a reset to let me reprogram it for my company's wifi. Quickly and easily added it, but then discovered the switch that was at home no longer showed up on my app. A little research online get me to Belkin's FAQ. And there it is: NO, you can NOT use the devices on multiple wifi networks. If you have multiple devices on multiple networks, you have to have a separate device hosting the app for each network. This isn't a major issue, but does seem like room for improvement or upgrade. UPDATE: (05/19/2014) - Have bought more WeMo devices, light switches & receptacles. The android app is disappointing.

Android app issues while out of town,1.0 ,"I want to like it. I bought it so I can remotely control lights in my home while I'm away on business trips (I travel often). I also have VueZone cams, so when I'm in Eastern Europe and want to check to make sure the recent storm in SF hasn't caused any flooding in my apartment, I can turn on the VueZone cam and turn on the lights in the room with WeMo. I'm writing this from Romania, where the WeMo app no longer will open on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S4). The progress wheel just spins and spins all day long. It's frustrating, because I can't see my apartment. As a workaround, I send emails to IFTTT site where I created a trigger to turn on and off the lights. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, and now it wants me to be on the same WiFi network as the WeMo to set it up again. Ugh...I can't quite do that from Romania. Huge fail Belkin.

Support seems to not exist at all, so there was no way to contact anyone for help. This is a simple idea, after all it's a switch! Overall, this product sucks. My end goal was to connect it to my Amazon echo and control two plugs for Christmas. Simple task...

Unable to setup the switch because WeMo app is flawed. Don't buy!,1.0 ,"Just received the device, and the instruction from the box is self-explanatory. You first plug in the device into the power outlet, and then connects to the ad-hoc WiFi access point from either your Android or iOS, and from there, launch the WeMo app (assume you already installed WeMo app beforehand). Within the app, you should be able to select your home network, and that's where the disappointment ensues. To my surprise, WeMo does not support WPA2 password that contains white space character! This is a major fail that Belkin should have advertised. It is a waste of time to make this purchase, if it requires you to change password for all other devices, simply because WeMo fails to perform the simplest task (being able to connect to a WiFi with full support of WPA2 passwords).","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I've not been able to get mine to work so far. I went looking for an API for them months ago and came up short - if I could just talk to them via a web service or whatever it'd be swell, but really - the app is garbage, and no other apps I've found work. I hope some other company sees the potential here and capitalizes on it, or that Belkin fires the idiots in charge of software for this and re-release it in a more useful state for the geeks it's intended for.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

It would be nice if I hadn't lost so many hours of my life trying to get this thing to work and if Belkin customer support had been a little more useful.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Wonderful Customer Service - Works Great with Amazon Echo,5.0 ,"Update- I contacted Belkin customer service. They are so helpful 1-800-223-5546 they stayed on Line on line until it was fixed. 1st - the I-Pad has to be set to IPhone apps - to get the application. 2nd the reset button takes 15 seconds to process. She stayed on line and even helped me with Alexa to discover the device - and made sure Alexa could turn on and off the light. The 5G issue is still a true problem, but Alexa works only with the 2.4 G - therefore WeMo had to work Please ignore this 1st review - but it does let you know some of the frustration in the setup.So sad, does not work on a 5G network we purchased this for a father who is in assisted-living to work with his new Echo. We tested it at our home that had a dual band and it does work fine great device, but at his facility we only had the 5G so it wouldn't work. This was the main reason for purchasing the echo as he is disabled and we wanted him to be able to turn on a light.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

It works when you first set it up, but after a little while, Alexa can't find it, even though you can still access it via the Wemo app. I did some online research and discovered that this is a known issue but not publicized. Something to do with the switches using UPnP (?) or something, which is ""brittle"", as opposed to cloud-based connectivity??? Who knows. I just want it to work. Since I bought it *explicitly* to work with Alexa, it's useless to me. I'll be returning it.

Buggy but set up.,3.0 ,Just getting started ... got two of the only one installed because I literally ran out of time the first set up took so long ... time will tell for the moment I will work with only the one ... the issue I had is that while standing in site of the device I would lose connectivity and it would drop and my phone would then run to the home wifi network. I uninstalled it and tried again and seem to have gotten it working with a factory reset. This was on an HTC smartphone ... when the initial problems started I tried to install it to my system using an iPhone that saw the plug 'once' and then never again. Timers are set and if it works over the next few days will come back and re-review and install the other one ... otherwise the 30 Prime clock is ticking and I will mark the calendar but hoping I don't have to return them.

Do you need to control your light from your phone?,2.0 ,"The switch is as advertised; however, one should think about whether it will be useful. If you're in a small apartment, for example, there isn't much reason to be able to control a light from your phone when you can easily take a few steps to turn it off. The main reason I purchased this was for the scheduling feature (to turn on a light in the morning as a visual alarm), and in that regard it works, albeit clunkily. The app feels somewhat primitive and isn't easy to use. For example, it should be a straightforward exercise to set a time to turn on and off a switch, with a single action. Instead, it requires multiple steps. Also, the unit is fairly bulky and blocks another port on a power strip. Overall, I can't say it's a bad product, but I think it's worth asking if it's a needed component in your house.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Pain to install and keep working. Not plug and play.,1.0 ,"1.5 stars.. This was a pain to deal with from the start. Installation took 3-4 attempts to fully get the device broadcasting and then getting the app to work with my wifi. After finally getting it set up it worked for 2 days until a firmware update was needed. After that, the Wemo plug stopped broadcasting over Wifi. I had to do a manual reset which involves holding down this annoying restore button for upwards of 30 seconds. After the plug was restored, I had to go through the set-up process AGAIN with twice as many errors. Got the device working again only to have the app not find the plug. A device like this should be plug and play. There should be no need to have to contact customer service to find out why the device isn't broadcasting, router settings should not have to be changed, and I sure shouldn't need to do a fresh install every time there is a firmware update. Perhaps updates in the future will fix these issues, but I am not paying $40 per plug to be a beta tester for Belkin. When it works it's extremely convenient. But there are still far too many bugs to recommend this for anyone.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I've been using these for about 2 or 3 weeks, and not all of the plugs have issues, but it's very frustrating to those that do. I did an app update for the Wemo yesterday, which actually seemed to make the problem worse rather than better. I now have one of two lamps that won't connect at all and has to be turned on and off manually. As it is a floor lamp situated behind a couch, this is not an easy task, and has thus led me to become very frustrated with this smart plug!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,1.0 ,"I would give this NO STARS if I could. After wasting my entire day, making three phone calls (spending hours on hold!) and an on-line chat with an almost non-existent customer service department with Belkin, the WeMo switch F7c027 will STILL not connect to my Amazon Echo - which is the only reason I bought the switches & light switches. I had no problem connecting my Echo to the four(4) Honeywell WiFi thermostats in my home, so I know what to do. I have sent an e-mail to Belkin hoping that maybe their weekday staff is better informed than their weekend crew, so I will wait to return everything until I hear from them. Hopefully they will be able to tell me what to do to get these items to connect to Echo. I really want this to work!

"Poor security, poor connectivity options",1.0 ,"There are two huge flaws with this device. It doesn't work on 5 GHz Wi-Fi (which is really useful in congested urban areas or apartments) and, more importantly, can't handle secure network passwords. The latter issue is a deal-breaker -- if your Wi-Fi password has any characters other than numbers and letters then this device can't connect. To use it you need to lower the security profile of your network and use passwords that are easily prone to hacking. Given the recent spate of malware attacks on IoT devices, its really inconceivable that a mainstream company would be so extremely careless. Personally, I'm not going to change my network password and reconfigure a dozen devices just to accommodate the limitations of the WeMo Switch. Unfortunately I didn't try to hook up the device right away so it probably can't be returned and it's become a pretty useless paperweight. I love my Phillips Hue lights and their Alexa/Echo voice control. I was hoping that WeMo would provide similar satisfaction, but I have to recommend that people look at Phillips and other options rather than WeMo/Belkin.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Good Switches - No Hub Required. Check out IFTTT. Make sure the price is worth it for you.,4.0 ,"Good Switches - No Hub Required. Check out IFTTT. I’m editing my review because I now own both the outlet switch and light switch. I like the idea of having switches that don’t require a hub like so many others do. I own this light switch as well as the version that plugs into an outlet, see my review of that one as well. I think that the WeMo platform is stable and well thought out although I do wish there was a laptop/desktop (non-mobile) interface. If you only have a few switches it is fine, but if you had like 3 or more it would get cumbersome. Don't let the other reviews scare you if you are technology competent. I hesitated to buy this because of the connectivity problem in other reviews. I can only conclude that those people are more like my grandmother than myself. I will say that installing the light switch requires a bit of electrical knowledge (or at least willingness to learn) and a bit of patience with the WiFi setup. I also had to switch WiFi networks at one point and it was a bit of a hassle and required a decent amount of googling around forums. There is a helpful video on this page. No, it isn't absolutely an easy 1-2-3 set-up, but I don't really have any complaints either. This thing does what it says it does, has a good app, and works well for me. In the app you can also set up more complicated rules for on-off, so it isn't like your light go on and off at the same time every day, making it obvious they are on a timer, you can use sunrise/set. I also like that you can disable rules without deleting them. So I can basically have a set for when I'm home, and a set when I'm out, and it is a simple transition from one to the other. What I like about the light switch as opposed to the outlet switch is that you can use it without the app. You can just press the switch and never have to care that it is a WeMo switch if you want. This is nice because with the outlet switch you have to leave the lamps on and control it only with the app (yes there is a button, but it is inconvenient). This means that guests or anyone else has to learn about your nutty setup just to turn on a lamp. This light switch fixes this problem and I really enjoy that. I travel a lot for work, and so I use these mostly as a light timers just so it isn't so obvious when I'm not home. What I like is that when I am in a hurry out the door I don't have to bother setting anything, and I can just do it once I'm waiting at the airport. You can do all kinds of nutty stuff like setting it up with a motion sensor, but for me it is just a controllable light timer. It should be noted that this literally 16x the price of a normal light timer, so you pay a hefty premium for all of this. I have the light switch installed in my bedroom and I use it to help myself wake up. I’m a heavy sleeper and having the lights turn on is a huge help. By the time you are reading this I will assume that you know that the light switch will require a neutral wire and a deep electrical box. This is almost guaranteed in newer construction, but you should check you switch box before purchasing. Obviously this doesn’t apply to the outlet switch. An often overlooked aspect of the WeMo platform is the IFTTT integration. I think this provides two huge opportunities. The first is that you can add “Do” buttons to your lock screen. This means you can control the lights without unlocking your phone or opening an app. It’s just like swiping up and opening the camera. I’ve included a picture of what this looks like. The second nice part of the IFTTT is that you can utilize the actual “if” functionalities. For example: I have mine setup so that if I lose my phone I can press and hold the light switch and it will call me. HOWEVER, I bought the light switch when it was $42 and it has been going up in price. I think that as it approaches $50 the competition really opens up and the alternatives are worth consideration. This is a 20% price hike and I think that is substantial. Also, two minor complaints First, the outlet switch itself if huge. I feel like it should be 1/3 the size it is. Also, the light switch has an indicator light on it which is a bit bright for my tastes. You can see in one of the pictures that I have a bit of card stock taped over it to make it dimmer.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Not reliable enough to depend on,2.0 ,"We have four of these Smart Plug switches around the house. The two that are stationed on either side of our Alexa (and the WiFi hub) and operating stand lights in the living room work every time we tell her to turn off the living room lights. The one that is about 10 feet away attached to a Sensi candle (and a plug that is very hard to get to) has to be told upward of 4 times to turn off before it does. It never has a problem turning on, but off doesn't seem to be its thing. Our last one is about 25 feet from the WiFi, and it has the same problem with on and off. I don't get it at all. All of the devices worked just fine for at least a month or two, then we started getting these spells of having to repeat ourselves. Now it's a guarantee that one of the two Smart Plugs will have to be turned off manually.

"Worthless, so far.",1.0 ,"Well, if I want to use it as an on/off button on the wall, it works great. But I bought it with the Echo, and so far I cannot get them to talk. Yes, I have both the Echo app and the WeMo app on my tablet, but I don't want to control them with my freakin' tablet. I want Echo to turn the stupid thing on by my voice or at a pre-arranged time. But since Echo cannot ""discover"" the plug, it ain't gonna happen. No, I'm not a ""techie"", but I'm also not a moron. I don't want to spend 5 hours researching this thing; I want it to work straight out of the box. Isn't that what the techies are supposed to design this garbage to do?!? Or at least print some real instructions, not a card saying ""go to the app"". I'll keep researching, but I'm probably trashing this stupid thing and will find some other device that will actually work.

Deeply Disappointed,1.0 ,"Loved this at first. Bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband along with Amazon Echo. Although it was a initially a bit difficult to set up it worked like a charm. Had to reset it once, again a bit cumbersome holding in the reset button for 12 seconds while plugging it in... but once reinstalled, no issues until a few weeks ago. The device stopped working. Again went through the reset procedure and can get it to work with the WeMo app but Alexa (Echo) fails to recognize the switch. Went through all the troubleshooting recommendations and still no go. Plugged it into another outlet and lamp and still nothing. Alexa responds to everything else she just cannot detect this device. Very disappointed for the price, would not buy another. I don't know if it is and Alexa problem or a WeMo problem. I may try another manufacturer to see if it is any better.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
SMART PLUG?,1.0 ,"Why is the WEMO SWITCH referred to here as WEMO SWITCH SMART PLUG? I find NO REFERENCE to SMART PLUG on the WeMo website. Actually, I think SMART OUTLET would be a more appropriate name, but WeMo NEEDS TO GIVE IT A UNQUE PRODUCT NAME and AND update their website so we can find stuff about this product on their website. I've tried to find an operation manual to NO AVAIL so I can find out what the restore button on the back of the thing is. Something so simple and yet nowhere to be found. An operation manual would also hopefully document all states of the status light. Try looking for that info here or on WeMo website. Impossible. Update 7sep2016: I stumbled upon (didn't find it via search) the status light info at [122247] (search for 122247 on the wemo website support page). I also stumbled upon what the restore button is for, covered in a youtube video [YuvfmVbq7WM] (search for YuvfmVbq7WM at youtube.com). That video tells you to press and hold the button while plugging the device back into the outlet and release after 5-10 seconds. Previously, I was just pressing the restore button without unplugging and replugging the device back in. I did the correct procedure and my 3 WeMo SWITCHES (OUTLETs) have not dropped their connection all day and have worked like they should. Previously, I was finding these things to be VERY UNRELIABLE and needed resets sometimes multiple times a day. Yes, I've did everything on their 7960 webpage, updated firmware, etc, etc, however, I did NOT set my router to use a specific channel, shouldn't have to, for none of my other devices require that. If the power blinks they come back online by themselves, no muss, no fuss. But like I said above, they've been working okay for almost 24 hours now, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Review for basic outlet switch only,5.0 ,"This review section is confusing as Amazon combines reviews for nearly the whole Wemo line of products into one. I can't tell how well my product is reviewed by other customers, but this review is for the ""Switch"" - which is a device that plugs into an outlet, and provides an alternative outlet that is controlled by the device. The version I bought doesn't provide information about electricity usage, it just turns power to your appliance on/off. Initial setup was a bit rocky. The device takes a few minutes to establish itself and start sending out its own wifi signal. I think people will have better luck connecting their phone to the device if they wait 10 minutes after plugging it in. Once the app connects to the device, and you've updated the firmware, you're set to go, and can access it from home wifi. The device can be connected remotely (from outside home wifi), but this has to be set up every time you connect a new device. I have 2 of these outlet switches and had to disconnect and reset the remote connection after setting up the 2nd switch. It's been running a week so far, and no trouble at all. It works via 4G (although it says 3G on the app) or wifi, and IFTTT works fine as well. No complaints. Update: A week later, still no problems. From browsing the web I noticed a few helpful hints: 1. The box states it needs to be connected to a ""wifi router"". But there are all kinds of routers and I am not sure if it connects to every one. Mine is connected to a 2.4ghz band b/g/n router. Actually it's connected to an Apple Airport Base Station router that has both 2.4ghz (b/g/n) and 5ghz (a/n) bands, but it connected itself to the 2.4ghz b/g/n band. If you don't have a ""g"" router, or don't know what your router is, check the web or call Belkin. I bet most people have ""g"" capability on their routers so it may not be an issue. 2. I noted that someone on the web had an issue with his router's security setting. It was set to WPA/WPA2 Personal, which didn't work. He reset it to WPA2 Personal, without WPA, and that worked. Mine was set to WPA2 Personal from the beginning, so I had no issues. 3. The SSID (name of your wifi network) apparently can't have 2 capital letters, according to a post on the web. So ""MYweb"" won't work but ""Myweb"" will. My SSID complies, but if this is true I wouldn't be surprised if it's the major reason people have issues connecting with their Wemo devices. I haven't found any other wrinkles. By luck, my router and its settings worked fine from the outset. None of these settings are mentioned on the packaging or the one-page instructions. I could not find system requirements on Belkin's Wemo page either. Hope this helps someone.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Weak WiFi Signal - Get a TP-Link Instead!,2.0 ,"The TP-Link is far superior to this switch. I think the big problem is the strength of it's wifi. It took me 30 minutes to get it to work in the first place, because it took a long time to connect, then a long time for the app on my iPhone to find the device on my network. THEN, I put it in my garage, because I wanted to set the timer for my Christmas lights. It couldn't reach my wifi signal in the house from there, even though I have other devices that do. I swapped out a TP-Link switch TP-LINK Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa, Control your Devices from Anywhere (HS100) and it connected instantly, and it is now running my lights.

"Initial setup is hit or miss. When it's connected, it works well.",3.0 ,"UPDATED 3/15/17: As the title said, my initial setup was tedious, taking a few tries to work. But now that I've replace the router (home WiFi was flaky), this plug works fine 99% of the time. Original review: I have 3 WeMo devices (I only bought this one via Amazon): 1 light switch, a Switch Smart Plug and an Insight Switch. I got them all a month apart, because I wanted to avoid paying for a hub from another manufacturer. I also chose it because I saw reasonably-good reviews here on Amazon. I figured that, since I'm technically-inclined, I wouldn't have the troubles that others reported. But I've found getting them connected initially is very flaky and it's taken multiple tries for each of them, requiring a device reset each time. Connecting to my WiFi network has been the toughest part, though I also find them very slow setting up their own WiFi to enable this connection, taking up to 5 minutes to show up each time. Since each device took 3-8 tries to complete, that's a lot of frustration and wasted time. I have two locked WiFi connections, but the iPhone app didn't recognize the password entry properly the first time for any of the WeMos. The iPhone app is also very finicky at identifying a new device, and it also doesn't allow you to change WiFi networks. I also have an Amazon Echo that uses my WiFi, but it managed to get the WiFi password directly from my phone, so I didn't need to re-enter it. Why can't the WeMos do that? This original Switch Smart Plug was working pretty solidly for a few weeks, but was offline for a while last night. Now the other two are offline and only this Switch Outlet is connected (seen by the iPhone app). I just contacted Support, though I don't have high hopes. I am *SO* glad that I didn't install one of these on my elderly mother-in-law's TV, as I was planning. I do enough tech support for her as it is! :-(","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It works fine with google home too.,5.0 ,"For those of us that have the Google home device, these work just fine via IFTTT. Setup was a breeze and now we can control multiple outlets and light switches via google assistant. The only small issue is that there are 2 different outlet wemo products listed on IFTTT and it is important to get the right one selected. Otherwise You will get a weird message when creating the recipe in IFTTT. We now have outside lights running on a timed event and we can turn them on/off with voice command. The kids can turn on/off the tree and the scheduled events will keep things under control.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Didn't work,1.0 ,I thought this was going to be great but it ended up being a nightmare. I was initially able to set up the device. It worked. It updated the firmware and no longer worked. I called Belkin tech support. I waited 20 minutes on hold before I got someone. The tech was great and seemed to know what she was doing. We tried both IOS and Android phones. We reset everything. It worked again. We updated the firmware and it stopped working. Turns out this was a known issue. The only solution was to replace the item but they wanted me to pay for return shipping. I had been on the phone with them for over an hour at this point. Thankfully Amazon allows me to return a defective product easily.

"Which is worse, the device or the app?!?",3.0 ,"Either the switch won't connect to my wireless or the app shuts down before I can complete set up. I've been restarting my phone, the wemo switch, and my router. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared my cache. I've been on the phone with wemo support. Nothing works. Now the theory is that the problem is the latest version of the app. It is too new. But the old one is not available. Seriously?! Do yourself (and your sanity) a favor, and find a different product. ***Update: 1 hour and 45 minutes on the phone with tech support, and about an hour and a half on my own, and now I have 2 working WeMo switches. Worth it? Not yet. But at least they work. I had to use both an iPhone 5 and a Samsung S5 because I could only accomplish the initial set up with the iPhone but then the WeMo only properly works with the Samsung phone (the way I wanted it). My Echo is really how I control it, and that pairing was a breeze. I still suggest a better switch. I have one more WeMo switch in its box which I am too scared to set up at this point. I'll wait until a weekend where I have absolutely nothing else to do and then attempt it. Way too much work for an outlet.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Promising, but set-up and WiFi reliability let it down",2.0 ,"'Promising' would be the best word to describe the WeMo Switch. Unfortunately it falls short. The set-up is very finicky, often losing track of the WiFi network I've told it to join -- even when right next to the base station. Hit join, fail; hit join, fail; hit join, fail. Hey it worked. Immediately it asks for a firmware update. Which kills the unit. So I repeat the whole process again. It's now been over an hour of mucking around with the WeMo. On my 3rd attempt, the unit stayed online, but I have not unplugged it to see if it will survive a power down. I'm not hopeful. Belkin: 1) Fix the app. It crashed on me several times. (Latest IOS7, iPhone 5s) 2) Fix the firmware upgrade process to not break your settings 3) Find out why your WiFi is so unreliable and fix it 4) Polish the set-up process. This was possibly the worst WiFi device set-up I've been through. Would a micro USB port be too much to ask for? Bouncing back and forth between WiFi network SSIDs is clumsy at best, and mostly just unreliable/hacky.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Works great with Alexa,5.0 ,"This was definitely an easy set up. I surprised my children with bits and pieces of our smart home, including an Echo Dot, Hue lights, Harmony hub, and I added the WeMo switch just to see their faces when they walked out on Christmas morning and I said ""Alexa, turn on the Christmas Tree."" Naturally, once the tree comes down in a couple of days, I'll be putting this on a lamp and will rename the switch. :) I'd definitely recommend this as an addition to your smart home. The price is right, the set-up is simple, and it functions exactly as intended. If this review helped you, please check that it was helpful.

Best Smart Home Gadget I own!,5.0 ,"The WeMo Switch is a very easy to use device that can come handy in many different scenarios. You can use the Switch to power just about anything that can be plugged into a standard outlet. I have 2 lamps hooked up to my Switch that are set to turn on and wake me up every morning at a certain time. The possibilities with the WeMo switch are endless. To turn it on, you can manually click the button, but the best way is through your phone. You can even turn it on from the other side of the world, no joke! To get the Switch up and running, you need download the WeMo app which is available for iOS and Android. The app will give you a simple set of instructions on setting it up. It’s shouldn’t take any more than 5 minutes to finish. My tip for you is to make sure that the WeMo is connected under the same wifi network that your phone is connected to. A super awesome feature of the app is rules. You can set specific rules for the Switch. With rules, you can make the switch turn on and off at specific times on specific days. You can even have it turn on at sunrise each day. You can also manually/virtually click the button inside the app to turn the switch on or off. Overall, the WeMo Switch is a very reliable product that can be used in an infinite amount of situations. Please note that it is not made of the high quality plastic but is still durable. This doesn’t effect me because mine is hidden behind a nightstand. The only problem I have found is that the outlet on it is a very tight fit. You can look at this in a good and bad way. It is good because whatever you plug in it will never get pulled out of the outlet accidentally. This is bad if you need to move the WeMo Switch around and plug devices in and out on a daily basis. To be honest, the tight outlet does’t affect me because I don’t even have a reason to unplug my lamps from it. I am sure over time it would get looser the more things you plug and unplug from it. So If you are looking for a place to start in the smart home world, this is great way to start. If you own other WeMo products, you can also control them inside the same WeMo app.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Need a new QA team.,1.0 ,I have tested 3 of these units all with the same poor results. The firmware fails to maintain connection to the network which prevents the app from showing the correct status AND prevents the user from manually pressing the button to turn off lights. The only way to turn off/on lights when in this state is to unplug the outlet and replug. This kind of behavior on firmware is blatantly unacceptable. The firmware/test group need to preform many many more extensive tests.The unit will only work <24hrs before require power cycling in order to get it back on the network and allow the manual switch to work.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Disappointed,1.0 ,"I am disappointed in this device. It has great potential. The mobile application is good and it has integration with IFTTT. It is very straightforward to setup - the setup is similar to other devices in its class. Once on the wireless network, it soon forgot it was connected. I had to reset the device several times to see it again. Every now and again it woke up for a little while but then dropped off the network again. I have no reason to believe the device is faulty, it is just flakey. Typically, a faulty device would exhibit some type of extreme behavior. As far as accessing it remotely, this is just as flakey. On and off, obviously because it cannot stay connected to the wireless network. The last thing I tried was to create a new, dedicated wireless network just for the device. I let it run for a week and could only connected to it twice for brief movements. I purchased a TP-LINK Wi-Fi Smart Plug a few months back and this device is incredibly stable. My only complaint is that it does not support IFTTT, which is why I tried the WeMo. But I will stick with the TP Link product. Belkin also dropped support for their developer API due to lack of interest. If I had to guess, the lack of interest is due to the instability of the device. If a company want stop play in the IoT or Home Automation space, a developer API is critical, in my opinion. Maybe dropping the API is an indication that they are not serious about this product space.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Horrible product horrible support,1.0 ,"Really I cannot express my disgust and disdain for this product. I went all in and bought 10 for the house. The setup process is not hard but is a pain and it is hit or miss. The biggest pain and if you do your research you will find this out on your own. These damn things just disconnect randomly and then you have to go through the 20 minute process ot fix each and every single one. Any time there is a firmware upgrade they lose ALL their info including your network name, their connection details, their names you have set . .everything. And you have to go to each one individually and reset it. You have to connect to the device by setting it up in your network settings as your network, then hope that it connects after 30 seconds or so, then open the app and hope it sees the device, then connect to the device, name it, set it up and then hope that it sees your network . . i mean it is an ordeal and you have to do it ALL THE TIME! DO NOT BUY THESE!!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Great idea, not ready for PRIMETIME",2.0 ,"Great idea, not ready for PRIMETIME. If you thought the setup of the WeMo switch was exhausting, buggy , and not as promised.. don't worry, you'll have a chance to repeat your installation every three weeks !! While it is reasonable hardware and a great idea, this version is too early and not ready; It goes off line randomly every 20 days. And or else you find pleasure in asking Alexa to turn off the lights and finding out that you have to reinstall the switch yet again, this product will frustrate you. The idea is great, the Hardware looks fine, the software is not ready.

Buggy software to say the least. (Update 7/29/2017),1.0 ,"Let me just say on the outset that I have many of these smart home devices from many different brands, and they are almost more trouble than they are worth. I'm a retired IT guy, and I know my way around networks, hardware, and software. The problem with these devices is they come with phone-based software that's buggy to say the least. And, I have used the software on a variety of phones and versions of Android, and it is very inconsistent, and always has problems And, with all but my Ihome devices, they almost always won't recover from a power failure without having to be re-configured or re-set up. I'm hoping that these device manufacturers will come out with some solid PC-based software for their products, because that would cure a lot of problems. I have yet to get the software to work properly on my Moto Z2 Play running Android 7.1.1. As it finishes up installing a new device, It can't find the home wifi network. So, the setup dies. I'm glad I kept my old Motorola Razr running Android 4.4 AT least it will work after 3 or 4 attempts. Update 7/29/2017 - it would appear now that not only can I not get both of these Wemo smart plugs set up, one of them won't even reset and go into setup mode anymore. They are both only about 7 months old, and have only controlled lights less than 75 watts.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Would NOT recommend! Don't bother if your WiFi has username and password. Even past that it barely works (very slowly).,2.0 ,"Yeah, the title says all. Don't even THINK you might be able to try this if your WiFi has a username and password. The WeMo only will connect to an open network (no password) or a WPA2/WPA network. At this point, this product is USELESS to me because where I live has a username+password to use the WiFi. Even at a different location where I was able to test it (at a relative's house), after toiling around with the obnoxious setup and resetting/""restoring"" about 15 times (this all took about a half hour), it was difficult to get the stupid thing working. Once it DID finally start working, it was VERY slow, with a very noticeable and prominent lag time of about 5-10 seconds from trying to turn it on/off from the app and when it actually responded. And mind you, the WiFi in that test location gets about 130Mbps download speed and 55Mpbs upload speed. For the non-technical people, this is pretty fast for a basic residential network. Also, the app is HORRIBLE. Lag, lag, lag, freeze, crash, restart, lag some more. Useless. Only works about 30% of the time for me. Many people have left reviews on the app and tried contacting the company with no help. I really wanted to love this because it would have solved several problems, but it is definitely NOT worth the money. Not at all. Maybe $10. It's a toy that works once in awhile. The company treats it like that and pays no attention to any of the problems. I would certainly NOT recommend this product. I only gave it the 2 stars because it was able to ALMOST function as intended on a WiFi network (though again this isn't even my home WiFi that I was able to get it working on).

Poor performance with Apple Extreme WiFi modem,2.0 ,"If you are getting this item to connect with Amazon Echo and your home wifi is running off Apple's Airport Extreme router -- it will not work. The WeMo switch only works on a 2.4GHz network band. While the Airport Extreme transmits both 5GHz as well as 2.4GHz, there is no way to force a network connection at 2.4GHz, even though you can force a network connection at 5GHz (don't know why Apple does this, but it does). What this means is that the Echo will normally be running at 5GHz on your home network band but to connect Echo with the WeMo (running only on a 2.4GHz connection) both MUST be on the same network (5GHz -- but WeMo only works on a 2.4GHz network so this can't be done). In order to remotely turn the WeMo switch on and off using a smart phone with the WeMo app, you first must go to the phone's WiFi settings and discover the WeMo's network and then connect to it rather than your normal home network running at 5GHz. Once it connects, you go out of the Settings and open the WeMo app and wait 30 sec's to a minute for it to find the WeMo switch (very slow). Once it has found the WeMo you can turn the switch on and off very simply (works as advertised). After that, you must go back to your phone's Settings and reconnect with your normal home network (generally running at 5GHz). Long and short -- it is both easier and FASTER to walk over to the WeMo and manually turn the switch on and off, which sort of defeats the whole purpose! Having voice commands through Echo is not possible using the Apple Airport Extreme until WeMo supports 5GHz network connections.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It works well but...,3.0 ,"Setup is a pain. I thought It would never work and then all of a sudden it just worked. I don't get it. Once it was finally set up though, it's been great. No issues at all and Alexa can turn on my desk-lamp for me. Aside from that, it's also bulky. It's very bulky. I wish it wouldn't hog surge protector space the way it does, I had to buy an extension so that it would fit. I can understand why these things need to be bigger than a real plug, but the engineers really need to take usability into account, especially on a plug. Finally, no Apple home kit integration. WTF? I know a lot of people don't have Apple ecosystem and they like to be super vocal about it, but theres a lot of us that do prefer Apple to everything else, it'd be nice if Siri could access this and it's ridiculous that a company like Belkin that's regularly featured in Apple stores has not integrated the Apple HomeKit into its smart home line of products. The last reason for the 3 star rating is the price, this thing is pricey for the WeMo branding (I got it on an Alexa holiday deal for $20 and I couldn't in good conscience pay a penny more than that for this).","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
WeMo Smart Switch Misconceptions,5.0 ,"I felt that I had to write this review about the WeMo Switch Smart Plug, because of all the misconceptions I found in the reviews when I was researching the purchase. I hope this helps others looking for a smart Plug device. I think it is a great device and simple to set up. Please note: I did not receive any incentives nor free products from anyone for this review. 1) “The WeMo Switch Smart Plug takes up both outlets” - I have the Decora outlets. When I plugged the WeMo into the top outlet, I was able to easily plug in a TP 6 outlet Surge protector into the bottom outlet. It also appears that any 3 prong plug would be able to fit. 2) “The WeMo is Difficult to set up” - It took me approximately 8 minutes to set up the Wemo Smart Plug with a Rule to boot. a. I first downloaded the WeMo app but did not open it, just to have it ready. Note, if you plan to download the app to an IPAD, make sure to look for IPHONE ONLY apps. The Free WeMo will not appear, if you are looking for IPAD only apps. b. I then plugged in the WeMo in to the outlet and followed the instructions on the App for locating the device in Settings /Wifi and then hooking it up to my Network. It then asked me to update the firmware. c. I understand that setting up a second switch would go even quicker and would use the same rules as the first one 3) “Can’t Turn on Remote Access” - I plugged in my lamp and It prompted me to name or take a picture of the device. It had the Remote Access on by default but I turned it off. However, when I tried to turn remote Access back on, it would not let me. I remembered in my reading of the reviews, that in order to turn on the Remote Option, you must be on the same network. I checked my Wifi Settings and sure enough, my IPhone switched itself to my regular Wifi network and my WeMo was on the Wifi Extended network (An Access Point). When I changed the Wifi on my IPhone back to the Extended network so that it matched the network the WeMo was on, it allowed me to turn on the Remote Access with no problem. (This actually took 2 of the 8 minutes) 4) I then set up a rule for turning the light on and off at a preset time. What a pleasure. And last but not least, I was able to easily link the Wemo to my Echo Dot by going to Settings / Smart Home and Discover devices. I can now tell my Wemo to turn on or off by speaking to Alexa. I hope this review helps. I now plan on purchasing a few more of these for some other lamps that are using timers. I would love for Belkin to come out with more Smart type of devices, like a water sensor similar to the D-Link DCH-S160 Wi-Fi Water Sensor.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

It went from working great to not even being discoverable at all. It still works in the native WeMo app but the whole reason I'm using the switch is to have Echo control it so I don't have to pull out my phone. Others are having this issue as well and calling WeMo/Belkin support hasn't achieved anything. From this post in the WeMo help forums you can see that others are having this issue too. [...] First post from 1/8/2016: With the latest firmware update (2.00.10062), Amazon Echo no longer recognizes any of the 15 switches I have in my house. With the exception of some problems in the very beginning when I first installed the switches, they have been working flawlessly for months (and through several firmware updates). Anyone else have this problem? The ""Solution"" provided by WeMo support is hardly a solution just passing the buck on 1/27/2016: Amazon has informed us that there is an issue on their end that something in our 10062 firmware exposed, though they haven't informed us exactly what the issue was or what conditions would manifest this issue. They have scheduled a patch to Echo devices for February 2 that they say will resolve the issue with WeMo devices running 10062 firmware. We've been unable to replicate whatever conditions are necessary to expose this issue. If we could, we'd try to analyze for root cause and see if there was any changes we could make to expedite a fix for affected users. As it is, we are simply waiting for Amazon to flip the switch to resolve the problem for those of you who are experiencing it. I understand just how frustrating this is; I would be quite irked if this were happening in my own home, as Alexa integration to my switches is one of my favorite things. For those affected, next week, you should be able to say the same about your own homes. Still nothing works via Echo for WeMo. Everything else that I've got connected to Echo works flawlessly. This is another example of half baked firmware released too soon by Belkin. Ironicly, I was about to buy a bunch of additional WeMo Light Switch, Wi-Fi Enabled, Control Your Lights from Anywhere, NOT Compatible with Amazon Echo until this happened.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Not easy to set up or troubleshoot. Often disconnects from WiFi making it useless.,1.0 ,"Initial setup is a bit of a pain but works only if you want everything that interacts with it using 2.4 GHz. Even allows you to set it to go on and off based on sunset/sunrise, when it works. When I changed my WiFi router, however, modifying this switch was a pain. The reset button did not do what it was suppose to do no matter how long I held it down or unplugging it and replugging it in while holding the reset button as one site suggested. I had to delete the device and follow the instructions as if it was a new device. Latee when trying again, unplugging and holding the reset button while plugging it in and for 15 seconds after plugging it in did work. After only owning it three months, it is often disconnected from my WiFi and therefore not turning on when it's programmed to do so. Makes it useless. I thought it was my router. I contacted WeMo and they told me it only works with 2.4GHz. Maybe it does. But when I set it up with my phone in December, I was able to set it up to connect to my router and everything worked great. Now it can't say if the DSN for my 5GHz router was listed or not, but I connected and everything worked even though my phone was always connected to my 5GHz wifi DSN. And it worked with my Alexa-enabled devices (Echo, Dot, Fire Stick & Fire tablet), all of which are connected to my 5GHz wifi DSN. There was a WeMo software upgrade as of a month or so ago, my light was no longer turning on as programmed and when I brought up the app, the WeMo switch was often greyed out and then a few minutes later, it was accessible. The light went on a programmed for a few days and then stopped working again. One night it just turned on by itself at about 1am (no rules to make it do so and no ""accidental"" turning on via app or Alexa. Turned it off and about 20 minutes later it turned on again. Figured I need to start from scratch which I did but the light does not turn on consistently using the rules I set up. And it appears greyed out on the app and then is accessible. I talked to support but all they did was tell me it was never going to find my 5GHz wifi DSN and told me I should change my other devices to be on that network. Really?!! I want the high speed to stream. Why would I downgrade just I can use this switch?! My Nest doesn't have that problem. Everything in my house recognizes both my 2.4GHz wifi DSN AND my 5GHz wifi DSN but not this device. Recommend you DO NOT BUY this expensive switch unless you never stream and/or have slow internet service so you don't care that it has this restriction. And I have serious concerns that it would still act erratically as mine is doing after less than 3 months.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
For novelty use only,1.0 ,"It works well enough if you set it up once, never touch it, and never have any power outages. But changing my WiFi network's name essentially bricked this thing. You see, there is no way to change the WiFi settings after initial configuration. Instead, Belkin instructs you to do a factory reset. Well, if you have IFTTT configured, or have more than one of these, that could literally take hours--and it simply isn't worth the time and effort just to be able to control your lights remotely or with your voice (with Alexa). I really wish I would have researched this device better before purchasing. I have a TP Link switch that works much smoother and changing the Wifi settings on that was just as easy as you think it would be.

Then, I attempted to set up a third. I couldn't get my WiFi to recognize the device. I tried everything I could think of with no results. I went online and read what worked for others who'd had the same problem. I even contacted Belkin Support and followed their instructions. In the process of uninstalling and reinstalling, plugging and unplugging, my previously installed switches wouldn't work. I was desperate so I decided to call Belkin support knowing full well I'd most likely be put on hold for a long time. I did have to wait a while, but it wasn't as long as I thought it would be. The WeMo Switch tech guy I spoke to, ""Michael"", was incredibly patient with me. I did everything he directed, some of which I'd already done, but hoping this time would have a different result. Nothing worked, but Michael was as determined as I. Finally, he asked if I had turned off my modem-router. That was the one thing I hadn't done. I turned it off, even went so far as to unplug the modem-router, waited a few minutes, and re-plugged it, turned it on, and with Michael's step by step instructions set up one of my switches. Voila'! It worked! I proceeded to set up the other 3 without a problem. (Before calling Belkin, I had received questions in my research about my router numbers that I didn't understand, but no where was it suggested something so simple as unplugging the modem-router and letting it set before plugging it back in.) I love my WeMo Switches and recommend the product without reservation!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Amazon Echo Integration Makes This A Must.,5.0 ,"Background: I bought my WeMo Plug for a floor lamp and my Christmas Tree lights and these things work great. I absolutely love the integration with my Amazon Echo as well. App: The app is easy to use and easy to set up. There are a lot of cheaper off brands of these but I don't trust how they are set up in terms of the actual product wifi security as well as the app security (how the app handles your sensitive information). You can trust Belkin, you can't trust some of those other apps and companies, some of which are based in China and may not have security in mind. Build: Like I touched on in the App section, these things produce their own wifi signal, and if you go with an off brand - I believe the access to your router and personal internet security could be easier to access. That part bothered me. I could totally be wrong but it's definitely a piece of mind using a trusted brand. The build itself is pretty sturdy. I'm don't think it's meant to be used in more extreme conditions, but I've been running a WeMo smart plug in my uninsulated garage as well for months and it handles cold and hot weather like a champ. Amazon Echo Integration: Now I thought using the app to turn the lights on and off would be easy, but to be honest I don't even fire up the app anymore. The integration with Amazon Echo is amazing. I am able to just turn off my lamps and lights with really natural voice commands. It's a game changer. If you're on the fence: Don't settle for cheaper alternatives. The WeMo line is not purely just quality, but is much more secure to me. The app is much easier to use, and it's integration with Amazon Echo makes this product absolutely amazing.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Extremely unreliable,1.0 ,"I have two lights that plug into a ceiling recepticle. I was hoping to use the wemo to turn the lights on and off from the ground. Unfortunately, the device is extremely unreliable. It will stay connected only for a few hours or a few days at most before losing signal. Then, I have to get a ladder to unplug and replug it back in. I have two units and they both work this way. Over the past one year, I have done multiple firmware updates hoping reliability would improve...it has not made a bit of difference. I do also have an Amazon echo and it is pretty neat to turn on and off Wemo devices...but what is the point if you have to constantly unplug and plug them in?","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Old Model? Obsolete?,1.0 ,"My Mom bought me one of these for Christmas (of 2015, I believe) & I was super stoked! I immediately ran home, downloaded the WeMo app & was ready for to set it up. To my dismay & disappointment I discovered that the wall outlet in the room I had intended for set-up needed replaced (for reasons unrelated to this product & irrelevant to this review). So, I tucked the Belkin ""smart plug"" into a drawer & there it remained until last week (Nov 2017) when I decided to connect it with my new Echo Dot so that I could voice-operate my bedroom lamp; ""Alexa, enable WeMo. Alexa, turn on the lights"", or whatever commands one would use... I never quite got that far >:/ Now, perhaps Belkin had upgraded their product & this particular model was out of date, which would be my guess. It whatever the case may be, I could NOT get the WeMo to do anything but blink a blue & amber colored light. The WeMo network option would pop up on my phone's WiFi list for 0.05sec then vanish! It would NOT connect to my home (Verizon) WiFi, it would NOT connect to my Echo Dot & none of the steps in the app's set-up guide (nor any solutions on the WeMo Help page) were assisting me in the set-up & connection of the WeMo device to any of the devices/hardware in the vicinity. I should have prefaced by saying that I'm not an electrical engineer but I have connected every single computer (& devices of the electronic/wireless nature that are found in my home), in the past, by myself with very little trouble. But something was wrong with this WeMo device & nothing, absolutely nothing, I did could get it to stop blinking blue/amber & just connect. After about 2hrs of frustration, I yanked the so-called ""smart plug"" from the outlet & whipped it across the room against the opposite wall. My frustrations had boiled over & I had had enough of this piece of.... Well, I'm sure you get the picture. I have a strong feeling that the model I had had become obsolete & un-upgradeable/unconnectable. Bottom line... I think I will be switching manufacturers & products on my next, very near future purchase. I'm saying bye-bye to WeMo.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Not only useful, but fun too.",5.0 ,"I've only had this outlet plug for a few days so I'm not sure about durability but thus far this is an awesome addition to our home. It has its own phone application so you can turn on whatever is plugged in to it from wherever you are. I attached the light in our bedroom to so I will no longer have to navigate our room in total darkness to get to the light and turn it on. The first day we had them I went to work leaving my my husband at home still asleep. I kept switching them off and on and he couldn't figure out what was happening. Yes, its not its intended use but it sure was fun. Being able to turn on your lights when you are out of the house comes in handy if you have a pet and are running late and don't want your furry friend to be in total darkness. I also own an echo and connected the outlet to that as well so I can turn on the light just by asking Alexa to do it for me. Reminds me of the ""Clapper"" device that came out decades ago but instead of being slightly goofy this really cool. If these were cheaper I'd have them in our kitchen, living room and our other bedrooms. I did order this through the echo which saved me $10 but you could only order one at that price. Otherwise I would have ordered several. Hopefully, as these become more popular and other manufactures start offering them, the price will drop. If not, I will enjoy the one I have and maybe splurge at some point to get a few more. The only down side that I have found so far is that the plug is huge so I could not use it in my power strip and ended up having to use the wall outlet. I'm sure that is probably a better place for it but I had to then plug the power strip I had connected there in to the other power strip I have in the other outlet. Regardless of that minor annoyance this is a very handy product that is helpful and a little fun as well.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Disappointed purchase,1.0 ,"I purchased this device for my boyfriend to use with his Amazon Echo. First thing, the setup was easy to follow. We kept having to try and connect to wifi within the app itself. We kept getting a password error when we were connecting it to wifi. Same password was entered at least 5 times, and on the last try, it took it. Once we finally got it connected, after numerous attempts to connect it to the device, we were finally able to see the device connected. That was as far as it would go. After adding the device, it kept saying not detected. So after my boyfriends failed attempts, I tried it on my wifi at my home. Guess what? The same thing happened. The only difference was, I was able to get connected (after numerous attempts and numerous hard resets). The switch showed up and it would allow me to control if remoteley all of about 4 times. Even then, I had to reset it manually about 3 times. I noticed that there was a firmware update. I tried to do the firmware update and nothing happened when I tapped it. After tapping it a few times, it lost connection with the Wemo Switch. This experience was horrible. I got this for my boyfriend who wanted this for months to use with his Amazon Echo that I got him for Christmas. I am sending this back to get a refund. I would never trust this device to do what I wanted it to do while I was away from home. Honestly, it is dangerous.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Amazing Device that can Make Life much Easier,5.0 ,"I recently purchased an Echo, so I decided to get a few of these to go with it. I use one for each bedside lamp in my bedroom, and the other for a crockpot. The very first thing you have to do when setting it up is download the app. Once you have the app, it gives you step by step direction which are extremely simple. All three connected quickly without problems. Then you can name each plug, set schedules, turn it on/off, and all of it worked flawlessly. I was pretty impressed by how quickly it all works. Being new to smart home devices, I expected there to be at least a little delay, but it works as quick as flipping the switch. Then I opened the Echo app and enabled the Wemo section, named the devices for Echo, and just as quickly I was able to control it by voice. They work just as good when using your Echo device, which is even more impressive. Even using the Alexa function built into my $50 Amazon tablet works perfectly. I have a few TP-Link smart bulbs I bought as well, and although they work great most of the time, sometimes there is a delay, or Echo won't work the first time, or they just unsync all together and I have to wait a minute for everything to sync back up. But that never happens with these switches. My fiance also has the app on her phone, and can control it as well, and she has reported no problems. She loves being at work and having the crockpot start whenever she is ready for it so that it's done right when it's time for dinner. I would highly recommend! P.S. I bought my from Home Depot, that's why it's not verified. I just enjoy these so much I wanted to let everyone know! P.S.S. What's some ideas people have come up to use with their switches? Lamps are an obvious one, but interesting ideas like the crockpot. I've tried thinking of other items I'd enjoy having the switch for, but a lot of things are digital, so even if you can remotely give it power, you still have to manually turn it on. Your washing machine for example, you can turn the power on and off all you want, but someone still has to manually adjust the settings and press start.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Make sure you get the correct app,4.0 ,"After some discussion we decided not to have any Smart Home devices although we have 3 Echo devices in our house. A friend gave us this switch smart plug as a gift, though, and I fell right to. After an ugly hour trying to get it set up from my iPad, I gave up and left it. Today I tried setting it up again and now I feel qualified to give some pointers if you're doing what I did last night. The WeMo app isn't available for the iPad- only for iPhone (although you can use the iPhone version on your tablet). I bought the darned WeMo Switch app because that's the only WeMo app I could see. Set it up using your phone, unless your iPad has a cellular connection. Otherwise it switches your internet over to the WeMo network. I think that's why I had network problems setting it up from the iPad. It's really very simple, I just made a few initial mistakes that resulted in frustration. If you're using a plug behind a piece of furniture, don't move the furniture back until you have it set up with Alexa. She'll ask you to use the switch so she can find it. I connected it to a lamp in the bedroom and now it's working fine. ""Alexa, turn on the bedroom lamp"" and *click*, on it goes and she says, ""okay"". Very straightforward and satisfactory. I've set it to come on when Alexa's morning alarm clock goes off so we have immediate light and less opportunity to fall right back to sleep. I honestly don't know if I can justify having more of these, but as a gift this is very, very cool.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Love the WeMo Switch Smart Plug,5.0 ,"This WeMo Switch Smart Plug has worked very well for my purpose. A number of our Christmas decorations at plugged into a surge protector strip that is plugged in under a table behind a couch. In the past, I have had to get under the table to turn these lights off and on. This year, I got the WeMo switch and connected it to my Echo. WOW, this is so much easier. I just tell Alexa to turn off or turn on the Christmas lights, and it happens. My husband laughs at me because I have only avoided crawling under the back table, but he didn't have to do it. When Christmas is over, I'm sure that I will find another place for this switch, but, so far, I love the convenience. It was very easy to set up in Alexa. I installed the app on my phone to set it up, installed the skill in the Alexa app, linked the accounts, and it worked.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I now own 5 devices,5.0 ,"I own 4 and use them in both of my homes. One house they are on the AC units in the den and bedroom. The other house they are on the bedroom heater and the bathroom heater/well wrap. Depending on the season and which house I am going to I throw them on an hour before we get there. They are great. But seems they have two issues: 1. I had to use two different phones because they are on two different networks - it would be good if the app had a internal selector for this. 2. Long term inactivity required a reset of the devices - and the devices have to be very close to the wireless device for the connection to work. Here's the proper reset procedure for the Model F7C027 switch using a iPhone for control: unplug hold restore button plug in while holding wait till light is amber let go of restore button wait till light is flashing blue/amber (first amber, then amber flash, then blue, then blue flash, then both flash) select device in iPhone Wi-Fi settings turn off cellular data in iPhone settings open wemo app enter device name (whatever you select as a descriptive) enter email address (your email address) click on network and enter password","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
FAIL! Buyer Beware of Security Gaps!,1.0 ,"FAIL! No support for complex passwords with symbols? No support for 5Ghz? Basically to make your home ""smart"" you have to use these ""dumb"" products. Basically to get this to work I needed to change and de-secure my network password which probably 30 devices use and that's a huge issue and not something I am willing to do. I had my Nest setup in 10 minutes. You'll be lucky Belkin if someone doesn't do this right and cost you millions. This should be a huge embarrassment to the product team at WEMO. Honestly, your telling people to automate their house and network their actual switches and given them base security options to do so. WOW! You should be forcing strong passwords!

Surprisingly bad,1.0 ,"I bought this to use with IFTTT and Alexa. I already use the TP Link switches but was disappointed to learn that they don't already have a good script. The WeMo plug was on sale for 19.99 so I decided to get one and only use it for my main light and use IFTTT to make it turn on when I was within 5 miles of home. I received the device in good condition, and immediately set it up. Set up was pretty frustrating but after a couple attempts, it finally synced to both my smart phone and Echo Dot. Not sure if there is a trick to do this easier but it only took about 4 attempts and I had to reset my router a couple times. This is where the problem starts. At first I thought it was odd that I had to reset the router, but didn't think much of it. After about an hour, my wifi disappeared and I had to go reset it again....and again....and again. In fact, ever since installing the WeMo, my wifi disconnects like clockwork. Weird, because my router is also a Belkin product. I disconnected the WeMo and I have had no issues with wifi outages. I honestly can't say for sure what's going on, maybe the WeMo pings the wifi router too much and there's a security feature on my router that disconnects it? I'm sure someone out there could solve the problem, but for me, this ended up being a waste of money and a pain in the rump.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Just got it, could use better directions",4.0 ,"Works great so far. I've only had it a couple hours, but so far it does what it says it will do. Only reason I give it four stars is the set up instructions which is pretty much a few pictures. It does actually set up Pretty easy. Using the app on your phone, name the device whatever you want it called. I originally named it ""WEMO"", then I plugged our small Christmas tree into it, and felt kind of stupid telling Alexa to ""Turn WEMO on/off"". I went back into the App and renamed the switch ""Christmas Tree"". To set it up with the Amazon Echo, you have to get it on your wifi network, and then tell your Echo to ""Find Devices"" If you rename the device after your Echo has discovered it under the previous name, tell Alexa to ""Find Devices"" again. It will then work with the new name and forget the old name. Lots of options such as hooking up with IFTTT and your Nest Thermostat. Also able to set schedules!

Burned Out After a Few Week's Use,1.0 ,"I want to add my voice to what some of the other reviewers have reported. My WeMo switch failed after just a few week's use. It wasn't overloaded, but it no longer shows any indication of being alive when plugged in. There is a distinct odor of something that burned inside of the switch. I tossed it in the trash. The same thing has not occured with competing remote switches that I own such as TP-Link and Avantek. These products continue to operate as expected. It's a pity too because I just received an Amazon Echo and it would have been nice to use the WeMo switch with Alexa.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

The only problem is that the Belkin switches are just too expensive Update: Up to 4 switches now. If you follow the instructions, specifically....go to your WiFi settings and look for the WeMo switch. Connect to that switch. After successfully connecting, the WeMo app will automatically disconnect from that WiFi and reconnect to your default SSID home/local network. Don't overthink this. Works ever time.

Fine at first then it became a headache.,2.0 ,"At first the WeMo smart plug was fine, however it does disconnect sometimes. I have two of them and I got them in November. I have the Amazon Dot and worked with Alexa for a little while. After a while I started noticing disconnects more often. Now one of th m just clicks when I turn on the light from Alexa or from my iPhone 7 or iPad Pro. What I know is that my iPhone and iPad are up to date and that's why I put the model of phone and tablet in this review. My HUE products work great but the WeMo switches are a headache. Just when I thought I had the lights on in the house for there to be some light in the house for when my wife arrives, there hasn't been any light from the lights I had connected to the WeMo outlets. My experience with these wall outlet smart plugs have been tiresome. I've come to the conclusion to just unplug them and toss them out.

"Great concept, and nice hardware, but firmware and app are lagging",2.0 ,"This is a great concept. The reason I bought it was because it was advertised as working with Google Home. However, the software and firmware for this device have problems. I am sure that this will get cleaned up, but right now this is not a stable device. The issues I had were: 1) Android app is very very slow. It took a long time for the app to respond to inputs, and there is an issue with how the app interacts with Android OS with regard to selecting between WiFi and cell connection. On the latest version of Android, you need to put your phone into Airplane mode, and then turn the WiFi back on. (The app tells you to select a setting that isn't there in the latest Android build.) 2) I was not able to get this to work with Google Home. The device was never seen by the Google Home app. 3) The app attempted to update the firmware on the Switch. However, this failed, and turned the Switch into a brick, and had to be returned. I want one of these things, but it's not yet there.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Flawed setup but once it's up and running things have been great,5.0 ,"Since purchasing, I have consistently good connections and reliable use. Not sure if I am in the minority here but it has been working perfectly for me. Not that I didn't have a hell of a time setting it up initially, as many other reviewers have noted, but once I got it up and running it has been smooth sailing. I have a lamp in my den plugged into it and then from there I have my IFTTT account connected to the Wemo and Amazon Echo. I use my voice to turn the lamp on and off and the response time is incredibly quick. I am VERY pleased with how everything works together. Those are the pros. And they are very big pros but I would remiss if I didn't reiterate what so many others have before me: setup can be a nightmare. I initially used my Nexus 6 initiate setup and was met with every manner of error. No response, not able to find the Wemo device, stuck in setup mode, device disappearing and reappearing in the app. Nightmare. After 40 minutes and several device resets, I decided to try using my Fire tablet in a last ditch effort before sending it back. It set up and had everything running on the first try. Easy as pie. I'd recommend turning off everything but the Wifi on your setup device when initiating setup. Seems to help greatly. Overall, the setup is quirky (I'm being generous) but once it's up I have had no problems whatsoever. I will most likely buy a couple more for the bedroom before the end of the year. Update 5/28/17 : Still using my switches daily and have had a great experience overall. I wanted to update this review to add that I recently switched to an iPhone and upgraded to a better home router, causing me to have to set everything up again as if new. Setup with my iPhone was ALOT quicker though I can't say that the updates the device and app have received didn't play a part as well. Still, things are much better since I first reviewed this so I felt it deserved an quick amendment.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Works, but very buggy software on Android",3.0 ,"Bought this switch as it was compatible with Amazon Alexa. Had to reprogram it when I changed my router, which was a pain. I almost sent it back figuring it might be defective as I had a hard time connecting to its WiFi with my Android tablet, but perseverance paid off where it connected long enough to get it set up. The ""rules"" button is unreliable. When I tried to change it, it wouldn't change, I had to delete the old rules, and start over for it to recognize the change I wanted. It started out with turning off the ""rule"", and I wasn't able to turn the rule back on for some reason no matter what I tried. Seems to be a very buggy interface. Once it is set up, it seems to work fine with Alexa. The one thing I also tried doing is changing the name of the switch. Although it appears that you can edit it, I wasn't able to make the new name stick - another annoying thing. So, to turn it off and on, I have to as Alexa to turn on Wemo, rather than something more appropriate.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Needs A LOT of work before you should buy it.,2.0 ,"Many problems during setup: It could not be connected to from my Verizon Motorola Droid Turbo. After I connected to it from my older tablet and connected it to my network, I could see it on my phone. It said there is a new firmware to install, then the Android app crashed while displaying ""updating""! You must guess the cringing feeling of seeing something crash during a firmware update. But the device was fine, since it did not install the update, after all... It responds to the turn-on and off commands with a severe lag, and sometimes it just does not do it at all. The Android app frequently loses connection to it and reconnects. While I was talking to Belkin support, it turned on on its own! (maybe it was finally responding to one of the command it did not respond to?) So, the bottom-line is that I had way too many issues even during the initial setup. This feels like an engineering sample, more than a final product you should buy, having problems with the device and its Android app. It seems to be working better with Amazon Echo Dot, though the response is still slow and sometimes requires more than one try.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Most Unreliable Consumer Tech Item,1.0 ,"I've ever owned. The switch is unreliable and shows up as ""not detected"" on a random basis. I am not a novice and the cause is either a weak internal WI-FI card or Belkin's sever. Nothing wrong with my router. Moreover, Belkin support is useless and clueless. L2 and L1 basically read from a script and whatever troubleshooting steps you may find you are better off using Google to find. L3 if you can get your way through to them was not helpful either. Belkin has someone on Amazon doing what I consider damage control because the complaints are numerous and they are consistent with the ""not detected"" issue. I feel compelled to state my displeasure with Belkin's crappy product. To hit the company back instead of going through their hoops and hurdles to get decent help, I recommend you file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau or your state AG Consumer Affairs Department. That might light Belkin's butt on fire for marketing a beta product. Don't buy this junk until Belkin makes it reliable is my advice to you. Update 5/12/2004: To assist consumers in hitting the company back for your aggravation and forcing a remedy: Belking is HQed in CA. So, its most efficient to contact these agencies: CA State AG Consumer Complaints: [...] BBB of Los Angeles (where Belkin is located): [...] Belkin's address so you can fill out the forms properly: [...] Belkin International, Inc. 12045 E. Waterfront Drive Playa Vista, CA 90094 IMO, the reviews across not just Amazon but also Newegg, Google Play and Apple Store are consistently bad. IMO, this product suffers from some defect in design and should actually be subject of a class action lawsuit if there is no remedy provided by the company to fix the problem. Update: I came here to document Belkin’s poor customer service which is infuriating given the hold time and incompetence. Makes my blood boil at the indifference and poor training. From another retailer I bought a switch which happens to be labeled va01. Through Google, I discovered there is a va02 obviously a newer version. The people at Belkin could not tell me what is the difference and gave cursory answers basically indifferent to my concerns. When I asked if this meant she was not sure, she finally admitted yes. As a consequence I am returning the product. This is not to blame Amazon but I feel people actually read the reviews on Amazon. For the time I wasted I feel that Belkin should pay a steep price and that is lost sales if someone were to read this. Plus the other retailer (the electronics last brick and mortar national standing) should not be moving old inventory onto unsuspecting customers. Shame on them.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Never connects,1.0 ,"Of all the ""smart"" devices I've ever owned (Nest, Alexa, Lutron, Harmony, Smarthome, Lutron, and the dreadfully unstable X10) WeMo is the dumbest ever. The app setup flat out won't work either due to the device itself or the Android app or both. Within setup, my phone wifi can see the device and I can connect to it. Then I go to the app, then hit Next, then it says ""attempting to connect, please wait..."" and it either tries to do that forever, fails and says to quit the app and try again or says ""The WeMo App was unable to connect to 'My Network Name' Please try re-establishing your password. OK"". If I re-enter my password (which i shouldn't have to do in the first place) it simply says ""attempting to connect"" again and the same nonsense happens. Can't understand why, but there is no browser-based setup of any kind, no Windows app, no nothing. I don't see any 3rd party apps that work unless you already have it set up, which I can't. Garbage.

Problems have become quite common,3.0 ,"The setup is a bit clumsy using the app, but once setup, the switch worked quite reliably using my Amazon Echo for a while. But recently (2-3 weeks later), it has stopped working for no reason. After much resetting, it will work for a while and then stop again. This is all using the Amazon Echo. Manually turning it on and off works, but that's not the point of the device! And sometimes, the WeMo app works while the Echo doesn't. I can sometimes fix Echo problems by performing a ""Discover Devices"" process, but this really shouldn't be necessary. I feel WeMo really need to up their reliability of the product. It needs to be rock solid for people to rely on it. Also the app needs a lot of user interface improving. You should also be able to run the app on different devices (e.g. an iPad and Samsung Android phone) and it should be able to see the same devices. Currently you can only see devices in the app on the particular device you set it up on.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
GARBAGE!!!!,1.0 ,"I bought 2 of these and they both worked great for a couple of weeks and then they stopped connecting to the Internet. I checked my wifi and everything is working just fine. I hate these things. EDIT: so every time they lost connection, l had to reset them which was once every couple of days. resetting these things is a pain, because there is this button in the back that you have to hold for 5 seconds. now what you have to do is unplug it, and then plug it back in while holding the reset button until the light flashes. this is almost impossible because the button is behind the switch, which means l have to have my hand smashed up against the outlet while l put my finger behind the switch to hold the button and then get massive hand cramps. TERRIBLE DESIGN!!! now it will not connect at all no matter how many times l reset it. l have had it with these things and l am going to take it out back and whack it on my chopping block.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Perfect Plug ....for awhile.,2.0 ,"I bought three plugs last December to use with my tree and other holiday lighting - including a light in the bathroom. UP to that time, I've always purchased the smart bulbs but this time I wanted to control other things so I ventured out to the Wemo Switch. Some things have changed since I purchased/installed but - at that time - I thought the ""app"" was clunky (it's a little better now). However....all three plugs stopped working (lost the connection) within 90 days - give or take a week or two. Nothing else changed during that time. I'm the IT expert in this house and I've read every online community post, followed the instructions listed everywhere and spent a great deal of time ""re-setting them. What a pita. Now two work but one of them can't be found by my Ipad App Wswitch. Would I buy them again? Nope. Too much trouble to ""keep"" connected.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"TLDR, good device, crappy support.",3.0 ,"The product itself is actually pretty good, once you get it set up. Therein lies the issue, this was painful to get going. First things first, don't bother with Wemo tech support, they're undoubtedly one of the most useless tech support portals I've ever had the misfortune of calling. They couldn't fix the issue, promised me a call back the next day from a senior engineer, the call back arrived 4 days later, after I fixed the issue myself. The setup process was very painful, the Wemo app refused to pair with the Smart Plug and thus join my wi-fi network. Eventually after going through every setting on my router, the only way I could get the app to pair with the device and join my wi-fi network was to change my entire network broadcast frequency to wireless B. Once that was done the app paired with the device and all was ok. I was able to change my network back to B/G/N afterwards and it everything worked. I was able to join the Smart Plug to my Google home and it picked it up with no issues. The painful part was the lack of knowledge from Wemo support and the lack of any documentation for the device. After trawling through multiple forums with no fix in sight, it was luck on my part that I found the fix.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
This Thing Turns Me On!,5.0 ,"I got this on sale and together with my Echo Dot, I love this thing. First I had it connected to my Christmas tree lights. I just had to say ""Alexa, turn on the tree"" and viola! I now have it connected to my living room light and have set it, through the WeMo app to automatically turn on at dusk and turn off a bit after midnight. Of course I still get a kick out of asking Alexa to turn the lights on and off too. I was a bit suspect reading that some people experienced limited Wi-Fi range with this thing. I haven't had that problem. My router is about 75 feet from the WeMo and it has worked flawlessly so far. It was a cinch to set up the WeMo app. It took a bit of playing to get Alexa work with it (was my first time with a device like this), but after I got it up and running, it works perfectly. The only thing I don't like is its size. I wish it were a bit smaller.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I give up!,1.0 ,"I am at the end of my rope with this product. I have spent endless hours trying to keep it working. I want to say that WeMo customer support has been very helpful, even to the point of exchanging the two of these that I purchased for another model, but in the end my problems continue. Getting them to work took hours of repeating the reset process until it finally worked. A few weeks ago, I had a brief power outage in my neighborhood and after the power cam back on, both switches had stopped working. I have been unable to get them working again despite repeated attempts. I am sure I have spent at least 4 or 5 hours cumulatively trying to get these to work reliably. I am about to toss them in a drawer and try something else. It is nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on lights in a couple of rooms but hardly worth all the aggravation and frustration.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Software Really Needs Work,1.0 ,"Lots of software problems with this and no instructions that help. I bought 3 of these and put 2 in our Vegas home and one in our Tucson home only to find out that the software won't handle 2 locations. Also, you can't change the schedules once you load them. Well you can but they don't work. Now I have to manually turn them off and on each night. What a pain. Another problem though is no instructions on how to do anything but set up. Once the setup fails, you can't find the wireless account as it won't show up. Pressing the reset on the device doesn't help and doesn't appear to do anything. Won't buy any more of these turkeys. Update: if you reset the wemo switch to factory settings you can reload the on/off settings and change the schedule. However. There are no instructions that come with the switch and you have to learn on your own.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
The dot synced right up and working perfect. Next came the Wemo,1.0 ,"I got this and the echo dot for Christmas from the wife. The dot synced right up and working perfect. Next came the Wemo. I'm tech savvy and this ""wemo"" has been a complete nightmare to get set up. I've done EVERYTHING from belkins website and other tips and tricks from others around the net to get this running to no avail. After hours of fiddling, I finally got it to blink amber/blue and ready to pair. I get as far as selecting my wifi network and entering my password just for it to say ""please try re entering your password"". Every time. I've even uninstalled the app off my iPhone a minimum of 5 times just to get to that same point. Here it is, the Monday after Christmas and have messed with it a few more hours just to get nowhere. So I went to Lowes and picked me up the TP link equivalent......and BAM! First try. So this Wemo will be sent back to Amazon for refund.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Nice device, works perfectly with Echo.",4.0 ,"I've had this one day. Got it so I could control from Echo without having to go through a hub. So far, it does what I want. I programmed a schedule in the WeMo app (I particularly like that I can time the on and off times to sunset and sunrise, which I can't do with an iHome device and app). Then, I linked the device to Echo (took about 20 seconds to find it). Now I just tell Echo ""turn on table light"" and it works. If I don't override the schedule, it works per the schedule. I have it set for on 15 minutes before sunset and off at 11 pm., but there are many more options for time offset from sunset (15, 30, etc.). I have yet to find an astronomical timer that does this reliably. I have it grouped with ""inside lights,"" so when I get a few more switches I can go to bed and tell Echo ""turn off inside lights,"" and they all turn off. For the money, it's a pretty good device. I'm still playing around with hubs from various manufacturers, and may find a better solution. But for now, this works perfectly with the Echo without a hub.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"Could Be Easier To Setup, But Certainly A Must Have For Any Smart Home!",5.0 ,"I have 3 Wemo switches now. 1 Smart plug and 2 insight plugs. I am really satisfied overall, but I have a lot of networking and computer background and it still seems that these can be touch finicky to setup. Similar to setting up a google Chromecast you make a network connect directly to the device and then it will connect to your wifi. I have had to do this to each device as I add them, even though the app should keep the network passwords and so on. Ultimately, this should not stop anybody from buying these, but they should be aware that depending on your network and mobile devices, it may take a touch of messing around to get them up and going. However, these are amazing products, depending on how much thought you put into how you will utilize their magic, you can really do some cool things with the wemo family of products.

WeMo Switch is a great piece of equipment.,5.0 ,"The reason why I choose WeMo Switch instead of many other cheaper products are solely because of compatibility and realiability. It works with all the device that I had, such as Alexa, Smartthings etc.. very easy to setup, all you have to do is plug it into power source, open WeMo (Belkin) app and select the WeMo temp Wifi, setting up took about 3 minutes for each WeMo (I have 3 of them). Connect to Smartthing (Samsung) and Alexa (Amazon) is pretty straight forwards. 1. For Smartthings: Open Smarrthings APP, navigate to Marketplace => (at the bottom of the page) Choose SmartThings Labs => Choose Belkin WeMo Switch (Labs) => Choose Connect Now - Wait for 3 - 5 minutes (do not close the app, just leave it there for 3 - 5 minutes, depend on your Wifi connect), all of the WeMo switch previously connected to your Wifi will be there to choose, click and choose the desire switch. 2. For Alexa: Enable WeMo skills on Alexa and navigate to Smart Home to discover new device. - Make sure the name for each WeMo switch is not too similar to each other, it will driving you nuts later on if you do so (LOL) International Usage NOTE: eventhough this product is rated at 120V but I have been using it with 220V in Viet Nam for nearly 5 weeks and haven't got any problems since then. There is no heating issues, I'm still alive so I guess everything is working. But your mileages will vary, use it on 220V with caution, it might burn down your house, I don't know and I certainly won't take any responsibility if you do so.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
out of box experience & initial setup,1.0 ,"Just got mine for Xmas & got time to setup. Opened box & surprised there was really nothing there other than the device, until I realizes the Quick Setup instructions are on the back of a piece of cardboard used inside the packaging. The WeMo app is required to do anything with the switch. App is also required to have Amazon Echo access it, but had to figure that out myself, as there were no instructions or even mention of using WeMo w/ Echo. There's also no information on product registration or warranty info anywhere to be found. Setup was relatively easy, but I've experienced better. You have to connect to a wifi SSID presented by the WeMo first & then send it your home wifi settings. Mine worked w/o SSID broadcasting & using WPA2. UPDATE 2/2016 - Unreliable product. still works but has had to be reset to factory defaults & reprogrammed 4 times so far. Also unreliable via Echo - often needing to repeat command 3-4 times before light turns on/off, even though Echo responds OK, meaning that it thinks it was able to do what I asked.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Not as pictured,2.0 ,"Hmm....not as pictured. I bought this as a gift so it's still in the box. It is indeed a WeMo switch, but it's a BELKIN WeMo switch (not mentioned in the description), and it says ""belkin"" on it, not ""wemo."" The look is also a bit different. I'm wondering whether the reviews here are for the switch pictured or for the switch I received. I place my orders heavily based on reviews, so all of the reviews I read for this product might be useless if I received a different/updated version. Giving it 2 stars because it MIGHT work just fine, but it is not as pictured, and if I'm purchasing a product, I expect to receive the one shown.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Bulky yet very useful HA tool,5.0 ,"This plug is the perfect solution to unique or otherwise troublesome home automation issues. Case in point: my wife has a Tiffany lamp in the bedroom that she uses to read by. It uses chandelier bulbs, so rather than replace the wall outlet with a smart one in order to add it to our network, this switch integrated effortlessly with both the Smartthings hub and the Echo. If I had to change anything with it, I would integrate a rotatable wall plug as the unit is very bulky and depending on your needs for the outlet it may require a 2 plug outlet on it's own. Thankfully that wasn't the case with us as I was able to flip the other plug over, but I just wanted to advise everyone ahead of time.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Ample for when needed but does have a few minor flaws,4.0 ,"I have owned my WeMo switch since I received it as a gift for Christmas. We have just one and there have been numerous times I've looked around the house, trying to figure out where to add another one or two of these devices but can't find the perfect spot. I have too much connected to my entertainment system such as a cable box, surround sound system etc in my media room that need to be powered on every time. But upstairs in the living room, I just have the standard LED TV mounted on a wall with no sound bar or anything attached so as long as the cable box is constantly on to record DVR's, this has worked out perfectly. Setup was a breeze, if I recall. It took some finagling because it's bigger than you would expect and I had to move around some outlets, it essentially covers up two spots on a power strip so keep that in mind. I haven't downloaded any third party apps because there isn't much extra functionality that I need it for, just to simply turn on and off whenever I request it to. I turn it on and off remotely for our new puppy so he doesn't feel so lonely throughout the day from the app. I also utilize Amazon Echo a ton to turn the TV on in the morning when coming down the stairs and I don't want to fumble around looking for the remote in the couch cushions. All great features and I have no issues there except it doesn't always respond to my voice commands to flip on and I don't think that is an issue with Echo. It works I'd say, 80% of the time correctly. The others it simply does nothing. I'm not sure if I've had any issues when using the phone app only because when it turns green, I assume it's ON. What do others use it for? I've seen for coffee makers, clothing irons etc but to me that seems to be overkill. If I was to put it on my Keurig, it still won't make my coffee because there is another button to press. The TV is the perfect spot because that usually requires another device (remote) for it to work, now I have effectively added another way to turn it on besides walking over to the device and pushing the small button on the side of the TV myself if I lost the remote. BUT AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR DAT! It's a glorified power button and the price point turns me off a bit too, this should be a $19.99 product, not double that, for what it does. Get one, try it out on the most simple of devices in your home and hopefully you too, will see it does at least service its purpose.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works as advertised,4.0 ,Owned this about 3 months now. Using it to schedule a table lamp with the solar programming recipes and turn on/off with my Amazon Echo. The app is very easy to use for programming. Echo operates it seamlessly with voice command. I would give it 5 stars but I found it not working one time so far. I unplugged it from the power and back in again and it started working fine. I am not sure if the device was at fault or if the main power glitched at my home so I can't really place blame on the unit. If I encounter future problems or none at all I will adjust the stars accordingly. This device sets up fairly easy. It will initially send out it's own wifi signal you use to connect to it so you can enter your home router's SSID and password. Once that is established you can enter all kinds of scheduling recipes from the app. So much easier then programming the digital timer I had before. Since this unit connects to your Wifi it keeps its time updated via the network. Make sure your router is set for the correct time or auto update. My initial requirements for this purchase were that the unit would store the scheduling recipes and operate on it's own without app interaction and through power failures etc. It has done all of that just fine. Occasionally on a cloudy day I like to turn the lamp on earlier then the scheduled program so I use our Echo device to do that. Longevity will be the next test for me to really decide.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Horrible item and dismal app,1.0 ,"I received 2 of these as presents. I have to say that these are the worse electronics that I've used in ages. If I could give zero stars I would. Firstly, you have to download their app, which is really big and asks for access to all kinds of personal info on your phone (for really no reason other than what I'd call to spy). Secondly, after downloading the app you are likely not going to get the thing to work. (The app is a pain to get going too...) We tried diligently to get it to work on one - the instructions are nonexistent and the online directions are not great. Nonetheless, we did get one to work - but only for one day!

I like most everything but the size,4.0 ,"Very fast and easy to set up the device, no problems connecting to my network or to my Samsung Galaxy Edge 7. However, setting up the connection to my Echo was another story. That was a challenge. Possibly because I have 2 Echos, I don't know, but the Echo couldn't seem to locate the device, so maybe the wrong echo was trying find it and it was out of range. I'm just guessing. Anyway, now that it is setup and running, I really love being able to turn the lamp across the room on and off with voice commands and being able to do it while I am away from home is a great security feature. The only thing I really don't like is the size.it is way too big. Next time I will get a Mini.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I will use my good ol' light switch,1.0 ,I should have paid attention to the other negative comments. It worked for a few days with my Echo and Dot. Then it stopped. I spent several hours over the course of the day to no avail. I deleted the application and re-loaded it at least 10 times. I did a factory re-set on the switch at least 20 times I tried it in different places in my home (My wifi is very strong). I re-booted my router several times. I re-booted my phone several times. Even thought I have other working devices on my network Echo cannot find the device... I finally called tech support and after they gathered all the marketing info they needed they listened to my problem. The young lady was appropriately courteous then put me on hold for a few minutes.

"Very easy to use, works like a charm and is kinda fun",5.0 ,"We bought two of these and they're great. We use them with our Alexa for family and bedroom lights. I was impressed by how easy it was to setup. Took about 3 minutes with the app on my iPhone to get it on my wireless network with very simple questions. The Alexa app then found it in seconds. Just a note, pick a name for the switch that makes sense to tell Alexa. I name mine ""Family Room Lights"" and then connected all of my lights to the plug with an extension cord. Now I just say ""Alexa, turn on family room lights"" and they go on. Before, we would go to each one, lean over furniture etc and turn them all off. This was a pain when you fell asleep watching TV.

WeMo Plug In Switch,4.0 ,"To begin, I purchased a couple of these WeMo switches not from Amazon, but from Dell, so my review is solely on the device. Out of the box, the packaging is very simple. All that was in it was the switch and a card with instructions. After plugging in the unit, connecting my phone (Samsung S5) to the WeMo's wifi signal, I was able to configure it using the WeMo app. I set it up on my home's wifi network (same network that my phone uses when I am at home), and it was connected. I was now able to turn the switch on and off from my phone. I then had a notice to update the firmware which I did. Once that was done, I experienced some issues accessing the switch. My phone app would be unable to locate the switch. So I ended up resetting the unit and redoing the entire process again. It has been a little over a week now and it has been working as I would have hoped. I can turn the switch on/off at home, on another wifi network, or on cellular service. My only complaint about it so far is the size (it basically covers up both outlets), the loud clicking sound it makes when you turn it on/off, and the issue I had initially with setting it up. For simple home automation, I'd recommend this unit. I am actually going to set up another one of these switches soon along with a couple of the light switches.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Should have Switch'd long ago :),5.0 ,"I bought this product at a home depot, after trying various programmable outlet timers. I consider myself a pretty tech savvy guy, but the digital lcd display ones are needlessly convoluted and complicated. Some even lock time zones to specific regions. The WeMo is pretty straight forward, plug in, click the power button, connect through your phone's wireless set up and open the app. You can have multiple switch units connected at once, with varying timers. It is very streamlined and very easy to use. My only minor complaint was that they didn't add in another outlet, but that can just as easily be fixed. I don't know the range too well, but I have one in a basement and one in the upstairs living quarters and the wifi range is always on point.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great device with a couple of downsides! I like it!,4.0 ,"I like the device end it woks really well in my home integration as it stands today. I use it with Amazon Echo & IFTTT and so far worked flawlessly. Sadly it will not work with Apples HomeKit. That is the only reason I never gave it a 5 out if 5. There is an article on the Belkin Wemo support site regarding why, check it out. Sadly, although I understand the logic and reason, it is still a unhappy situation and one that I am disappointed in. Also I find the device a little bulky so when put in a wall outlets that has 2 sockets on it it takes over the socket a bit and I occasionally find it difficult of find other plugs that will still fit the 2nd socket. Plus, as my sockets are vertically aligned, I cannot put two Wemo Switches on the same outlet because the they are taller than will fit. Maybe a ""double"" memo switch unit would be smart too make up for the issue.. ?? But I cant get anything like that . But... It work great for me in my home and my automation needs at this stage so I am very happy with it. Will I buy more? Maybe or I might look for alternatives that work with HomeKit and will fit the sockets better. Right now not sure about that. Will I get rid of my Wemo switches.. Nope.

It's great when it works,4.0 ,"It's great when it works, which is about 85% of the time. Comes in handy for hard to get to plugs and for setting up security light timers. It does however take up a bit room at the outlet and it'll go totally brain dead once in a while but a quick reset fixes the problem... . I have a few of the new little guys that only eat up one plug on the outlet as well and they are awesome. No issues with them connecting and are quicker to respond to commands.

OK. Wish there was better programming rules.,3.0 ,"This is a review of the standard AC outlet switch. There are two ways to program the control of this switch. The Wemo App for ones phone/pad has some very basic rules that can be set to turn the switch on/off. Then you can associate the Wemo switch with an IFTTT application and web page. I found it easier to use the web page to write simple recipes to control the Wemo Switch. There are probably some very interesting possibilities with IFTTT recipes if you are using the Wemo switch to control lights. For example, if you get close to home when driving, the lights coupled to the switch could be turned on. Unfortunately, I wanted more complex control and the IFTTT triggers are too simple. For example, I wanted to turn a recirculating pump for a water heater turned on and off every 15 minutes between 7AM and 10pm. Thereafter, I wanted the pump completely shut off. While there is a trigger to set every 15 minutes, it is active 24 hours per day. That is there is no nesting of IFTTT triggers. Anyway, this is an interesting introduction to IFTTT and its web server. Note that if you lose the internet connection to the wemo switch the IFTTT server and the IFTTT recipes will be unable to control it. The built in rules of the Wemo app are too basic and would require about 30 ON rules and 30 OFF rules to accomplish what I want. I am hoping the IFTTT folks can improve the day/time triggers to add some additional conditions so that I can avoid the 60 rules of the Wemo app. I have been using this for a day so I am not sure of the reliability. I have used the Wemo app most locally and tested with a cell connection. The icon on the button glows blue when the switch is turned on to provide power to whatever is plugged into it. The Wemo app has a corresponding green ring around the power button when it is turned on. When turned off, the icon on the button is dark. In the Wemo app, the green ring around the power button is dark. Thus, you do get some feedback when the switch is on and off. The speed with which a cell connection can control the switch is impressive. We just need to beef up the program control some. One more thing - the Wemo app is in the iPhone store only. An iPad version would be nice. ************** Update after 3 days. I went through three firmware updates over three days with my older style of AC outlet switch. Before writing many rules, plug in your Wemo and wait a few days for all the firmware upgrades. The last firmware update rendered my Wemo App rules unusable. The IFTTT recipes continued to work. I was told the remote access being enabled (to use IFTTT) during firmware update caused the problem. Be sure to turn off remote access when doing firmware updates to keep your rules intact.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Worst product ever - Unintuitive and Unreliable,1.0 ,"WeMo Switch is perhaps the worst product I have ever used in my life. I say this because I am usually very patient with technology and can be quite persistent when connecting things to other things. But WeMo switch was able to exhaust me out to receive such a bad rating. I wonder how this has over 6K reviews. Anyways, so the reason why this smart plug sucks is because of the following reasons: 1) Extremely convoluted setup process requiring you to first connect to WeMo wifi then head over to WeMo App to connect to your home wifi. It sounds simple, but it's not intuitive. Whoever designs this needs to review this process and compare to other similar products and why they are so much more intuitive. 2) When trying to install the switch first time and on subsequent restore attempts, my iPhone/Android/Another iPhone could not connect to the WeMo wifi. It shows up in the list of networks but always fails to connect. I must have done the restore process at least 75+ times over 4 different occasions. Same result. This is what frustrated me the most. 3) I have to say that the switch did work when I was able to complete the setup. Only to keep dropping the internet every few days requiring me to go through the grueling and useless process of restore (see #2 above). So today, after once again spending an hour trying to restore and failing to complete the setup, I decided to give up on this product. I cannot recommend this product to anyone. If you want to maintain your sanity, please look at alternatives as I am about to do.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"For those who can't get it to work, it's not the switch its your ISP.",5.0 ,"That's right. Your internet service provider changes your IP address every so often thus rendering your switch useless until you reboot your router.

If you know how, you can set up your switch on a static IP that will help keep it from faulting out. Otherwise just reset your router when your switch fails and thank your ISP for changing again.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Completely unusable on Android. Do not buy. (updated),1.0 ,"I've updated this review, in which I originally complained about the gaping security holes in Belkin's Wemo product. They've since closed those holes, which is great, and it would be even better if I could actually update the firmware on the devices. Unfortunately, that's not possible because the Android app is one of the worst pieces of software I've laid hands on in years. If and when it can manage to connect a Switch to my wifi network (just a few feet from the access point), it then can't find it when it scans the network. And yet somehow it can tell me what the firmware version on the device is - but is there any way to upgrade it from that screen? No. The UI is sluggish and constantly freezes at ""detecting devices,"" which it is unable to do. Belkin failed to publish details (an API) to allow other apps to control the devices, and their own software - as usual - is complete garbage. It's a wonder how these people stay in business. I got the two WeMo Switch devices despite a longstanding ""NO BELKIN"" policy because they were at a fire-sale price and I needed one for a really inconveniently placed air conditioner. Now, despite the dirt-cheap price, I'm stuck with useless junk due to Belkin's incompetence. I'll know better next time.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, WiFi",3.0 ,"Decent smart plug. Setup is easy. A big drawback to me is that it stays off after a power outage. There is no setting that will allow you to change this default behavior. This means you have to check the app periodically to see if the plug is on. If it is not, you can manually send the ""ON"" command. I cannot find anyway to change the default from ""OFF"" to ""ON"" or ""PREVIOUS STATE"". Some other brands of smart plugs allow you to set the plug to return to the state it was in when the power went off. I did find that I can use IFTTT to automatically send me an e-mail if it senses the plug is ""OFF"".","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Be ready for some frustration,3.0 ,"Got this unit on Friday and TP-Link on Sunday. Had issues from the start getting this set up using Android app. Lost track of how many times I had to reset unit and start over. Easily spent an hour to get it working, but once I did, had no issues linking with Echo. Tp-link arrived on Sunday and had it up in running in minutes, only took one try. I like the Wemo app, just slightly better, but not enough to pay 8-10 dollars more per unit.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Frustrating, may require a lot of maintenance",2.0 ,"I have 2 of these devices. The first installed quickly following the directions. The 2nd, purchased at a later date, had issues connecting to wifi. After trying a few times and going online, found a solution, which was to delete app and then reinstall. After reinstalling app, the installation worked as it should. If that was it, I would have rated higher, but then I had a power outage. After the power outage, both units would not automatically reconnect to wifi, just a blinking amber light. Again, after going online to research, the fix was to do a full reset and reinstall both devices. Looks like it's a common problem. If you're prone to power outages, I would stay away. Belkin blames the router, but I've had the issue by simply unplugging the device and moving it to another outlet. Purchased to use remotely, but the power outage problem makes it unreliable.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Light up your home!,5.0 ,"I use WeMo devices throughout my house; 9 plugs, 2 switches and two cameras. I have the downstairs lights programmed to go on and off at the times I set for them. We leave the program on when we are away, even on vacation. I control all of this from my iPhone which also connects to my iWatch which I sometimes use for the fun of it. I can check in on my house by looking in on my cameras. I can program the cameras to email me a picture if they detect motion; good for checking to see if someone is at the front door. We have an electric fireplace in our upstairs bedroom. It's great in winter to be able to turn it on a half hour before we turn in. I will say I had some problems getting connected initially. The stronger your signal from your Wi-Fi router, the better. Belkin needs to come out with a rechargeable battery version of the camera which will make it more flexible for installation. All in all, the products work great. I've been using them for two years or more and they still work just fine. Its reasonably priced. You can just start with a few plugs and then add as you want. Strongly recommend!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Poor unit,2.0 ,I have 3 of these and they were my first alexa smarthome devices. At first i thought they were awesome but after extensive use and using comparable units these are really not that good. First off they are slow reaponse rate is so slow compared to generic units. Yes generic units are better. Second is the app wemo is poor compared to tuya. Third if you have brownouts you have to physically unplug the unit wait a few seconds then plug it in. After being so wonderful i would rather get generic units that use tuya and cost half the amount. They work but thats it to much manual needs to rate it any higher,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Wifi connectivity spotty,3.0 ,"I bought one of these 3 months ago (from another store that offered a rebate). Setup is pretty easy. Setting up on-off rules is pretty easy too. Seems flexible enough. For my usage, being able to override the timed behavior (from within my home) is really useful. (I bought this more because I wanted a remote-control switch and less because I wanted a timed switch). And this worked pretty well for a while. (As a minor nit: The app has one button-- push on/ push off. And there's a delay from when you hit the button to when it updates status. It would be MUCH easier to use if there was an ON button and a separate OFF button. Then I could just hit the button and not have to monitor to see if it actually did what I requested.) It's been a couple of months now. Recently, when I bring up the wemo app, it claims it can't detect the wemo switch. And if it can't detect the presence of the wemo switch, I can't override the behavior. I think it still works reliably as a timed switch, but quite unreliably as a remote control switch. OH another minor nit: The ability to remotely control the wemo switch when my phone is not connected to my WiFi has always been unreliable. (There's a config choice of whether to allow access when phone is remote, and it's set to allow it, yet it's unreliable.)","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Home automation at its finest...,5.0 ,"I have five Wemo devices total, three light switches and two smart plugs. My favorite WeMo smart plug is the one that I have plugged into a power strip. The power switch holds the projector plug and two relay switches for a 12 V trigger on both. One relay switch triggers a linear actuator that drops the projector from the ceiling and the other triggers a motorized projector screen that is recessed above my ceiling. Since my projector has a feature called direct power, when the power switch goes on, my projector automatically turns on. Therefore my one WeMo plug controls three devices, I named the Wemo smart plug ""projector"" that way when I tell my Amazon echo to turn on the projector the projector drops from the ceiling, the projector screen drops from the ceiling and my projector turns on all at once. I also used the IFTTT app so that when the projector goes on all of my lights go off. Needless to say, I am very very very happy with my smart plug and have had no problems.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
50% success/failure rate,1.0 ,"Bought two. One installed easily. The other device is a complete failure. Have tried every reset...uninstall...install...fix suggestion on the Belkin site and beyond. The darn thing will not stay connected via WiFi. WiFi coverage is excellent in the selected location and is approximately 25 feet away from the wemo that works fine.

"Garbage, use a different manufacturer's devices",1.0 ,"Worked for awhile, but now they're trash (I have two). Alexa had trouble using them yesterday, so I checked the WeMo app and there was a firmware update, so I told it to update. Afterward, no response whatsoever, app says the two switches are no longer connected, and I've spent hours trying to get them reconnected to wifi, including multiple networks, multiple devices, multiple install/reinstallations, all resulting in failure to connect (to wifi networks that work just fine for many other devices in the house of course). I'll be using a different manufacturer for all future home automation products.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Easy to use and works great with Alexa,5.0 ,"I bought this as a part of my home automation upgrades. I connect my lamps to the Wemo switch and pair it with the Amazon echo. If you are not interested in color changing or dimmable lighting, this is way cheaper than the Philips Hue kit. It is also much more easier and convenient to use than Hue bulbs. The pairing process takes a few minutes but it is straight forward. It comes with very clear instructions and the app is also easy to use. Pairing with Alexa needs a few extra steps but it works perfectly. The good thing is that there is always a physical button to turn it off when you don't have Wifi.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Very happy for performance and price!,5.0 ,"What I love -- free and easy set up via WeMo app -- integrated with Amazon Echo flawlessly -- does NOT require a add-on hub of any sort -- and for all of the 'smart tech' that is out there, this is on the more affordable end of things.

"Great product, crappy software controls",3.0 ,"This thing is awesome. The device itself functions flawlessly. The supporting software (at least the Android version) sucks. It's slow, it's clunky, and it's cumbersome. I got around that by hacking together a couple of scripts that allow me to turn it on and off through a simple command typed on my computer. I doubt that my solution is going to be the same solution most people pick. It would be nice if they would improve their app, and introduce a web app that you could utilize easily from any web browser.

So far I really like this device,5.0 ,"So far I really like this device. It was fairly simple to set-up and install. Product instructions could have been a little better, especially to tie in with Amazon Alexa, but was able to figure it out. Once I installed the app on my phone the system did two firmware updates. At first I didn't think it was going to work on my phone - but I did a restart on my phone and everything fell into place. Note: If you change the name of the device from WeMo - to say ""Living Room"" you will need to go back into the Echo setup and have it refind the new name. Overall, so far I really like the device.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Looks like it wants a pefect outlet.,3.0 ,"Not sure how to be fair. It seems to work, although the app is not as user friendly as far as menu options, etc. I could not get the darn thing to be seen on the network in the app - my secure wifi network. The WEMO network always said out of range. The issue I found out when I finally got it to show on the network 100% of the time was if I put it in a pefectly working 3 pronged outlet. It was on a power strip by APC. I put it in a two pronged outlet with the wide blade for grounding by using a two to three pronged adapter. This I thought was acceptable since it did not match the 3 pronged WEMO w/o intervention. So be it. Yet it did not work in other 3 pronged outlets, they must be too old or unsure, because it was tried on the power strip and voila, it works. Now I am not sure why the others are not ok since they have been working fine on appliances with three plugs. Had not yet tried to put a tester or strip or UPS that has a circuit tester to see if the older outlets are not perfect. Seems odd though.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"The App is almost broken, No instructions, can't find my AP, an expensive unconnected switch.",1.0 ,"Maybe it works, if you have a few hours to try to get it configured. The (android) app will freeze, it won't let me change anything (I tried one AP which it refused to access, but I couldn't try a second until I did a clear data under the app manager - at least I know how). I got a frozen, unresponsive blank ""connected to ID:"" screen more than once. It doesn't give progress, it just has the spinner and will ignore anything except the home screen and it keeps going (failed) in the background. You have to set it as the AP so your android will want to connect to it, not the real AP. It just gives me the choice of ""try again"" or ""later"" when it can't connect to the AP (I have no problem connecting to with every other device) It has one instruction card with a bunch of confusing icons. Nothing about how to choose an AP. They need to completely rewrite and fix the Android app for this to even be partially useful.

The WEMO app seemed more streamlined than TP-Link's Kasa and is more pleasing to the eye but otherwise setup was similar. My only real dislike is the size of the thing, which is clearly pictured when you actually look at all the product photos (hey, it was on sale via Alexa so I could care less).

Automate Life,5.0 ,"I've Wemo'd my house and I don't regret it. My spouse likes the house cold while I like it warm. At night we have the ceiling fan going and I tuck myself under the covers. When I wake up I like to lay in bed for a little while but the problem is the fan is going full blast and my eyes dry out. Now I have to get out of bed to turn the fan off which ruins my easy going wake up schedule. Thats when I found that Wemo has the capability to turn devices on/off using a smart phone. I could turn off the fan when I wake up using my phone. I installed it to the light switch and discovered there is a scheduling feature which made it even more convenient. I have the fan automatically turn on before we go to bed and turn off at the time my spouse wakes up. This was the start of my Wemo addiction. Note: The product I used for the ceiling fan was Wemo Light Switch, not Wemo Smart Plug. Since then I've been looking for excuses to justifying Wemos for my house. Added another Wemo to the bedroom fan to control the light, because might as well have the capability to contron both light and fan. Had a baby last year and on many occasions dealt with the extremely fussy infant that would finally fell asleep in my arms. The room would get a little warm and need the fan turned on and light off but standing up to turn on the switch means waking the baby. Installed two Wemo Light Switches to solve that. Wemo team, theres a great commercial idea for you guys! My spouse.... well maybe it was me.... would leave the ceiling fan on in an unoccupied room over night. I set up a rule to turn the fan off automatically at 1:00AM to save electricity. Installed another Wemo Light Switch in another room where the windows face the street. Went on vacation and enabled the away mode to make it appear someone was in the house. Now for the smart plugs: I've turned the christmas tree on at sunset and off at 10:30. My spouse has these electric scented wax melts that turn on and off according to a Wemo programmed schedule. I would say to take precautions and evaluate any risks associated with having Wemo apply power to a potientally unattended device that purposefully generates heat. I've successfully connected my Amazon Echo Dot to the Wemos, ""Alexa, turn off the living room lights"" and they turn off. I was thinking about buying some Wemos as gifts for some elder family members who have mobility issues. I also have the Wemo insight smart plug and specifically bought it because it can monitor energy consumption. I thought it would be a solution to monitor when my washing machine has stopped using electricity, it would remind me to move my clothes over to the dryer, but Wemos currenly do not have that functionality. Plus I dont know if it makes sense to add that functionality.

"Buy a bottle of scotch instead, you'll get more enjoyment!",1.0 ,"Seriously...how difficult is it to make a wifi enabled device in this day and age? What a tremendous piece of trash. Keeps losing wifi connectivity more than 10 from my iPad. Try to restart and you have to unplug it and start from the top including dumping and reloading the software. Fifth attempt was my last, purchased on eBay from a seller that doesn't offer returns...should have got from Amazon...Lesson learned!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Good, working product.",4.0 ,"Pretty awesome. It works as intended, and is pretty easy to set up with the Amazon Echo. Pros: - It works as intended. - Functions natively with Amazon Echo. - Has a manual on/off button. - Allows me to yell at Alexa to turn on the nightlight, in stead of my girlfriend. Cons: - It's kinda big and unwieldy. Not huge, but it's really only suited for the top slot of a wall outlet. Tried to fit it on a power strip and it would have blocked off 3 slots. - The connection with the phone was a tad awkward. Required me to change some phone settings, switch over to its separate wifi, then put in my main wifi password. Other smart devices that I own didn't require that. Not a huge deal, and it's doable in under 5 minutes, but still a bit annoying. I can see how a non-techy might have a bit of trouble with it. Overall, still a really good product. My girlfriend approves.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Useful Device,5.0 ,"This is my first home automation type device that I've purchased. Setting it up was simple, just plug it in; install the app and follow the directions. After getting it setup with the application I also wanted to integrate it with my Google Home and IFTTT. You have to use the Wemo app to link it to your IFTTT account. Once that's done you can easily set it up with custom recipes. I'm just using a basic recipe that allows me to turn the specific light on or off with my voice via the Google Home. I will buy a few more of these and attach them to more lights and other devices in the coming weeks.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Don't waste your money on these!,1.0 ,"I've had two WeMo Smart Switches completely fail on me in less than 12 months. I followed all the troubleshooting steps recommended online by Belkin and no joy. They are dead as a door nail. I called Belkin customer service to get the first failed one replaced. Their ""technical support"" is anything but technical! It was clear the woman was reading from a script and knew nothing about the product. She kept me on the phone for nearly an hour asking me the same questions over and over, putting me on hold multiple times, all the while making me more and more angry. I'm thoroughly convinced that Belkin's ""support"" line is designed to frustrate you to the point that you just give up and hang up, so that they don't have to send you a replacement item! Anyway, now my second Smart Switch has failed and there's NO WAY IN HELL that I'll deal with their customer support again. Im going to tell the folks at the Apple Store (where I purchased all 5 that I own) to stop selling these products, because they are utter crap.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Waste of Money! Much better systems available.,1.0 ,"I bought one in-wall switch and 2 plug-in switches. The first disappointment was that none of them allow dimming - full on or full off only. I have been using X10 switches for over 10 years and they dimmed on almost every product. The in- wall unit had to be reset by turning off all the power to that section of the house to get it to reset about 3 times in 3 months. Then it failed to restart at all. The plug in switches also need restarting much more often than they should but did so ok until today. They lose their timer settings if power goes out and that happened a few days ago. One restarted with button push today, the other one is dead. It is found on network and WEMO control app but does not respond,nor will it provide power when on/off button pushed manually. It just does not work. I am out over $100. Warranty period passed. I am no neophyte when it comes to home automation. Over 20 switches/plugs in my home - more at Christmas. X10 has fallen behind times and has grown undependable. WEMO won't do. The new Wink system is proving to be dependable. Dimmable wall switches, and plug ins - easy remote control. Much more bang for the buck than WEMO. I now have a dozen WINK/GE/Leviton switches and individually controlled light bulbs. Not perfect but light years ahead of WEMO. The GE Wink capable bulbs are a super value.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works great!,5.0 ,"Works great Love this little wifi outlet. Works great with Alexa and very easy to manage. The only recommendation I'd give is why not include a couple USB ports on these outlets? If they are smart outlets, then they should get with the times and include USB outlets like how many of the dumb outlets are including nowadays.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Go ahead and roll the dice if you dare.,3.0 ,"Will not connect to my new netgear router. It sees the SSID but won't accept password. Tried multiple resets as others have suggested. Spent several hours trying to figure this out. I have now completely lost interest. Glad I didn't spend more than $20. FYI, if I have to call or email support to get this to work you have already failed. Moving on. EDIT: For what it's worth, I FINALLY got this thing to work by using my old Galaxy S3 phone to do the configuration. No matter what I did I could not get it to work with my Galaxy S7. I followed all the instructions to a tee. Belkin REALLY needs to step up their game on supporting current technology. In light of this discovery I am changing my rating from one star to three. I now have it working with my Echo. Had this worked first time out of the box it would be an easy five star rating.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"It works, but installation is a bit confusing.",4.0 ,"It took a bit to sync to the WiFi, but once it did it was fine. Directions say to plug device in with lamp or whatever you are using first, then sync however, I think it will be better to sync it, then plug in your item. There was also an update the same time I started using it. Ugh!!! Also, the app was a bit confusing at first to use, but once you get it synced, double tap the switch icon, and rename it. Also on setting automatic on/off, leave day you want highlighted or colored. I initially thought the opposite, since there is no instruction and the switch didn't come on. I adjust it and it has so far worked just fine. I bought two of these and now that I know how it will work, I will install the second one. I left it packaged incase I needed to return them to store. I also plan on getting the Ring and flat switch for my outdoor light.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
the product works wonderful. Still,4.0 ,"Setting this thing up (and all other Wemo devices) are a HUGE pain. Out of the box, you first have to connect a cell phone to the Wemo. That is never a problem. Then, the Wemo connects to the Wifi. That's a HUGE problem. I have one Switch Plug and two Wemo Light Switches and they all had issues connecting to the Wifi. Keeps saying it can't connect to Wifi. Wemo support said to me that it's my Wifi. Yeah right! Everything else in the house has Wifi that works. Wemo support tells me that the Wemo device is too far away from the Wifi Modem. Yeah right! I have a Wemo Light Switch that is less than ten feet away from the Wifi Modem and it still can't connect. I had to do a factory reset on all my Wemo's several times. And then try to connect over and over. Eventually, it likes it. That's my only complaint. After the Setup fiasco, the product works wonderful. Still, I plan to purchase more Wemo devices for the rest of my house, but I already know that I will have so much stress setting these darn things up.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works well but requires a little thinking up front.,4.0 ,"FIRSTLY I AM REVIEWING A UK 3PIN 230V AC VERSION I have had this switch about a week now and so far so good. I have this as a trial to see if it is worth getting more of these switches to further automate my home. Initial impressions when getting the unit out of the box is that it is a little large. There are several of these type of devices on the market now and even people building the WIFI capability into the socket itself so it must be possible to bring the form factor down a bit. That said, it is more than possible to get 2 units side by side in a 2 gang socket however head clearance or protrusion from the wall could be an issue with some installations (behind TV units for example). Setup was quite straight forward using the WEMO app on my phone, I liked the way that it could port through my WIFI info once i was connected to the device directly. This is make the configuration quick and easy. I have not experienced any drop out at any time via a BT Smart Hub so that appears to be quite good as well. I am running Alexa (echo dot) in the house also and when trying to bind the 2, I did encounter a few issues. Firstly, the WEMO guide will tell you to add the WEMO skill to Alexa. We dont have this skill in the UK skill store so that's not going to happen. All the installation guides for the WEMO equipment from there web site are for the US market to the extent that they even show all 2pin plugs not 3pin UK plugs. A little playing with Alexa and i found that I could search and bind to the WEMO directly without the need for a specific skill. This works fine however, I did also find then that if you rename the device using the WEMO app (I had to do this as Alexa did not get on with the word Booth and kept looking for bluetooth) you have to delete from Alexa and re learn as a new device. Once working on with Alexa, I have routines running now on Younomi to switch on as i return home etc. All in impressed so far however a little more up to date support and guides from WEMO and a reduction in form factor and this would have been a 5 star review.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works as advertised IF you can get through the setup,3.0 ,"Seems to work fine - its function is very simple - but setup was a major pain. Using current iOS and WeMo versions, had to reset the WeMo switch multiple times to keep it broadcasting its WiFi SSID long enough to get through the iOS WeMo app without WeMo's WiFi timing out. Then, after I had this happen, I had to uninstall and re-download/install the WeMo app to try connecting again.Took almost one hour for the whole thing to work properly - and the WeMo app NEVER told me that the connection to my home network was complete. I had to terminate the WeMo app and restart it to see that things were working properly.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"I wantedI to love this, I really did",2.0 ,"I wantedI to love this, I really did. I DO love the idea of being able to automate things in my home. The promise of being able to use a name brand product (Belkin), to use it on pretty much any appliance/light I wanted, being able to control them all from one app on my phone (or watch!), and the ability to integrate with IFTTT all sounded wonderful. And when it works, it is! I had ones connected to lamps in the living room, a space heater in the bedroom, and a steamer that my wife hated to have to walk to the other side of the house in the morning to turn on. Using IFTTT interface, you can create recipes that do things like turn on the garage light (I also bought a wall switch for there) when you approach the house, or turn on the lights in the living room at dusk, or turn on the steamer when you wake up. Like I say, sounds great, right? The problems, as others have said, is that the firmware and tech support for these devices are NOT up to par. I have spent many hours trying to do things like updating the firmware on the devices, getting my wifi to recognize the devices again, and dealing with the frequent interuptions in service. Seemingly any time there's a glitch in the wifi system, and sometimes for no apparent reason, the app can no longer recognize the devices I've programmed in, and I'm off line until I can find the time to re-do the process. When it does work it's golden, as I say, but the headaches associated with KEEPING it working have resulted in four devices that are simply more trouble than they are of use. For the last few weeks, I haven't even bothered with them, and am pretty well done with the Belkin/Wemo experience. Too bad, and once I'm over my disappointment, I'll probably research other possibilities...","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

However I did try the remote access feature but that's where the switch became unstable losing connection so I have no need for it and disabled it and it works my applications every time with no problems and I have no need to turn on my kitchen light when I am 100 miles away. It works well and looking to purchased more switches but I give it 4 stars because I find the switches to expensive for what they do, If they were half the price I would rate it 5 stars.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Does not work as expected, a bit difficult to get installed correctly.",1.0 ,"I have never gotten the Away Mode to work with more than one device active in my system. I worked with Belkin on this issue and they believed it was a software issue after eliminating the router (my network) andmy moble device as most likely problems. All other aspects of the WeMo work with a great bit of installation effort. This is a complicated installation, requiring attention to detail. Over time, I am sure Belkin will have this worked out and have a better product to bring to the consumer market.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Buggy performance at a premium price.,3.0 ,"Bought this to control some accent lighting in my loft that was only reachable by ladder and didn't have a wired switch. First tried one of those RF switchable outlets that claimed 50' range but ultimately maxed out at less than 3 feet (ridiculous I know). I read the mixed reviews on this unit but I wanted something that worked off wifi so there wouldn't be range issues. I only installed this today but it took quite a bit to get it set up. Setup wasn't bad but at some point the switch lost connection to the router. It was attempting to install a firmware so that might have had something to do with it. Additionally this does NOT seem to work with 5ghz N networks which is annoying. My phone and other devices in the house are all on the 5ghz band where my WEMO (and similarly my Quirky Aros AC) are limited to the 2.4ghz band. Luckily Belkin has remote access built into these things so it doesn't matter what network you are connected to (although I wonder if that creates momentary delays). Anyhow, after getting back into the loft and resetting the switch a few times, it finally seems to be consistently connected. I'll have to keep my eye on it over the next few days and report back if I have any additional problems. Good news is that my range issue is negated but for $50 I would have hoped it would support 5ghz bands and be a bit more stable at setup.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It's all about PROXIMITY,3.0 ,"If the unit is close enough to the wireless router, it stays connected and online, no problems. If there is the slightest bump in the signal, it goes offline, and is almost impossible to bring back without resetting the unit again and again. I had it upstairs from my Belkin router, and on the 300BM media channel, but it was not able to stay online, and I ended up having to reset it three times in 6 hours. Three names and resets later, I gave up on the upstairs light and moved it to one on the same floor as the router, and no problems since. Both the app and Amazon Echo are turning it on and off regularly with no problems. A stronger antenna in the unit might solve the issues, although to be fair, that part of the house is lousy with my phone and computer too. All in all, works well if it can stay online.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

It works well if you can get past the initial setup. I have a Nexus 6P which would never work with the app. I thought it might be a Marsh mellow issue but it appears to be a hardware phone issue. I ran it on my OnePlusOne with Android M and it worked. So if you get the app to load and setup on another phone, you can control it from another phone because it will discover it already setup.

When it works its great... however,3.0 ,"When it works its great... however: * If the device loses wifi connectivity the on / off actions will not occur - they appear to be pushed from the cloud not cached on the device. Waking up to find the coffee machine has not warmed up was not a highlight. * firmware updates are problematic. Most updates result in the wemo plug losing connectivity. I have had to hard power off / on in many cases and in some reset the device and reconfigure it to get it to work again. Most firmware updates report ""Upgrade failed"" and take repeated attempts. * Earlier firmware really really struggled to connect to a wireless network. The newer ones seem to be better, however this can take repeated attempts lasting minutes. Once bound it seems to stick... for at least a period of time. The connections periodically seem to go stale and I have to either power off all the wemo switches or force kick them off the access point. * Firmware updates will turn off power during a set program and not restore it. The on off behaviour is essentially not state managed at all, but rather relies on single one off timed triggers. A state managed option to say ""I want this to be on between these times"" makes a lot more sense than ""Hey lets try once and only once to turn this thing on at X o clock"" * App interface is pretty clumsy.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Quickly and easily added it, but then discovered the switch that was at home no longer showed up on my app. A little research online get me to Belkin's FAQ. And there it is: NO, you can NOT use the devices on multiple wifi networks. If you have multiple devices on multiple networks, you have to have a separate device hosting the app for each network. This isn't a major issue, but does seem like room for improvement or upgrade. UPDATE: (05/19/2014) - Have bought more WeMo devices, light switches & receptacles. The android app is disappointing.

I have to log into my router and unhide it in order for the WeMo outlet to see it. It will work okay, but if I rehide my network, the WeMo switch won't see the network anymore after a power cycle. It's hard to understand why Belkin designed it this way. None of my other WiFi devices act this way.

WeMo Saved My Life... More Than Once.,5.0 ,"Okay... so I'm sort of new to the automation stuff. I don't really want to invest tons of money to buy the high automation stuff, especially when I can do it with WeMo and Alexa. I'm more of a DIY guy so when I saw the Wemo Switch Smart Plug, I had to try one. Well, now I have 3 of them. One for my tree spotlights in the front yard. One to control the string of lights on the mantle above the fireplace. It also controlled the Christmas tree when it was up. And I just bought one Saturday because my wife said it would be nice to have her lamp turn on automatically. I just got an Echo Dot that we have tons of fun with. Alexa works well with WeMo. I live on a hill and have a steep driveway, so I heated it. I use the WeMo Switch to control my snow melt system. What a lifesaver that has been. I don't fall and slide to the bottom of the driveway anymore. I used to have to call my daughter who lives a couple miles away to go and turn on the driveway so it would be clear when I got home from work. Now I can just do it from my WeMo app on my phone.

All and all a good purchase,4.0 ,"I just bought this switch in order to control an array of lights that I have in my living room. Generally speaking this Switch is working as it should, and I would say even better than the WeMo Lights product I also bought. In an effort to enlighten potential buyers I have scrambled below a list of facts regarding this product. 1. The Android Application needs to be revisited by the developers. It is very-very slow and extremely buggy. 2. You need to have a solid router that can handle the constant I/O between the devices and the internet. My TP-Link 1043ND needed daily restarts so I decided to change that as well. As a rule of thumb a good 1900ac router is more than capable to handle the traffic. 3. If you have an Android phone you only need the device and an IFTTT profile in order to be in the position to issue voice commands to the device. No need for anything extra like Google Home or even Amazon Echo. 4. The size of the device is quite substantial, thus using this in a tight spaced power strip is a no go. At least without rendering useless more than one slot. All and all I would buy this product again, or if you feel adventurous you can have a look at WeMo Maker.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Great product with a finicky setup,4.0 ,"This product is the answer to every difficult to program light timer you've ever had. Once it is setup you can set your lights (or anything else you may plug into the outlet) with your phone. You can even set it to go from dusk to dawn and depending on your timezone it will adjust nightly to when that time is. It's a fantastic option. You can also simply control the switch from your phone. Turn on your inside lights before you get in the house, turn them off when you go to bed, it is massively convenient and the app is easy to use on iPhone. The bad part is the setup. It took me about 35 minutes to get the product working right, the process seemed like it should have taken less than five. When it first setup it did not automatically download the newest firmware. I had to reset the entire system and reinstall the app for that to happen. When it did finally download it did it very slowly. I sense less technically inclined people may have given up earlier. But if you stick with it you have a great product that does what few items on the market can. Especially at this price point.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I won't buy another,1.0 ,"This switch would not work with Echo. I tried downloading the skill, downloading the app and following the instructions to the letter. Nothing. Echo claimed it could find no device, switch claimed it couldn't connect to the network. Maybe I had something set wrong but since there are no instructions except a cryptic quick set up and no help offered, it went back to Amazon.

I was using it with lamps prior to my purchases of the TP Link light bulbs. Now i use it to turn on my son's TV and gaming system. It has made it easier for him to turn those devices off when he gets sleepy. I use to have to get up in the middle of the night to turn everything in his room off plus that cost money and he wasn't understanding that.

As crazy as it sounds I use these devices with my electric blanket and I have linked them to my Amazon Echo so I was able to solve a major issue in my marriage, having to get up in the middle of a movie in order to turn on our electric blankets.

The app has improved over time and it's pretty much all that needs to be discussed regarding the product. I use the Android app and here are my pros and cons: Pros: Connectivity with more home network configurations has been improved tremendously. I can set them up and see them all the time. The app identifies overlapping or conflicting rules. Cons: Some features like ""motion sensitivity"" - a duration of motion before the wemo motion triggers has been removed from the app several versions ago These utilize the time provided by your router. However, there is no place in the app to see what time the device has acquired (which is kinda important for a ti. On a few occasions, I've noticed my rules are triggering at incorrect times.

Don't go WeMo cause WeMo don't go,1.0 ,"I have used Belkin products for many decades. All the old products were superb. I bought this switch at a big box store for a simple application. What a disaster! I checked out the online discussion board (because you can't tell Belkin your problem). It seems that Belkin is no9t the company it used to be. The product firmware is riddled with bugs. The devices may or may not connect after a power failure. Belkin posted a solution to that problem: Put your router on a WeMo switch and if the devices don't connect after a power failure, cycle the power to the router. That is pretty tricky because if you shut off your router remotely using the WeMo, you will never be able to access the swith again because your network is gone. Another simple minded problem easily fixed, but NOT fixed: The WeMo switch does not remember it's state after a power failure. It always comes up off. Anybody who has even minimal technical capability knows how ridiculous this is. Even their own products years back (IP controlled receptacles) restored their state after a power failure. I read a lot of reviews before buying. Many people say how great the product is, so I discounted the bad reviews. Big mistake. The good reviews were probably written within days after buying and before experiencing a power failure. The long term robust standard for home control is Z-Wave. It is even used by commercial security companies. There are many controllers that support Z-Wave, including Wink. I highly recommend going with Z-Wave devices and forget about WeMo.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Disappointment - terrible WiFi performance,1.0 ,"Bought this smart plug for a simple use of turning a light on and off from a smartphone. Unfortunately I couldn't get it to reliably work as it wouldn't consistently connect to my WiFi network. I'm an electronics enthusiast and network administrator and tried everything. Eventually I narrowed down the problem as being with the device itself having extremely poor WiFi range and performance. It would only connect to my network when it was within about 6m/20ft direct line of sight of my router and even then it wouldn't stay connected reliably. Outside that range or with any walls etc between it and it wouldn't connect at all. After searching online it seems that many other people are experiencing poor WiFi connectivity with their switches, and that it seems to have been made much worse after a recent firmware update. Taking it back to the store for a refund asap.

Awesome product! Easy to use!,5.0 ,"I operate an electrical business. I use the Wemo switch for a variety of applications, such as switching outside flood lights, lamp posts, column lights, even area lighting around swimming pools and outdoor spas. My customers love it because of the convenience it provides, and because it is a cost effective solution for adding a switch. I have used Wemo products in my personal residence and I am very impressed with the product. Works just as it says it will and the installation process is easy. Also, I have consulted with customer service a few times and found them to be polite and helpful real people - not automated recordings telling you what website to go to for help! I highly recommend this product. The only complaint I have heard is that the device doesn't offer a dimmer function.

Works Great with Easy Set up,5.0 ,"This is exactly what I was looking for and it works great! I wanted a Wifi switch I could control my lights not only when I am away from home, but also when I arrive. The room lights are located in awkward parts of the room and at night in the dark it is hard to maneuver around the room. Having the ability to switch on the lights, even when I am leaving from an engagement and headed home eliminates the problem of busted knees. It also integrates with the RING doorbell/Camera system. If my RING doorbell or motion sensor goes off and I am not home, there is quick access to the WeMo app within the RING app which allows me to activate my lights with no hassle.

Simple the best!,5.0 ,"Look, there's 101 different smart plugs you can buy, but by far, this Belkin Wemo is the best! Why?

That's right, this is a home, so I don't want to be building a rack up for all this routers/hubs purely to tidy things up! Now, not having a hub could be a bit rubbish if you couldn't connect this to services like IFTTT (simple app that lets you set up 'if this, then that' commands to get your smart products talking to one another, thus, my Belkin Wemo is used to turn on a floodlight if motion detected with one of my Arlo cameras.

The first thing I want to address is the pairing with the app. I'm an iOS user and I downloaded the app as I was instructed to do. The misery started when I opened the app, the app crashed constantly and made the pairing very difficult. The second problem with the pairing was the 'pairing wifi network' that didn't show up for a long time. This was another thing that made the pairing a problem.

Unreliable,2.0 ,This switch always works great using the button. It's very unreliable and inconsistent with its connection to the wifi however.

Excellent Smart Home Product,5.0 ,"Great automation accessory and they're IFTTT compatible.

High Hopes,3.0 ,"I had high hopes for this little device. This is the first WeMo device I've owned. I have apple products and two Nest thermostats, so I'm a little spoiled on the ease of use. Cons: Very poor range for WiFi - I was in the very next room and had 'poor' reception. Buggy setup - It did set up correctly but only after several tries and retries No remote access - to be honest I wanted this the most. But after looking across the internet, this is a common problem. Pros: It does work as advertised if I'm on my wifi network, with almost instant off/on control. Overall this is a good try, but I don't feel as if its ready for prime time yet, I hope they improve things, I really want to like it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Cost Effective Smart Home Option,5.0 ,"Works well, and I can integrate it with my Google Home using IFTTT. Using IFTTT, I am able to set the switch to turn on when I enter a certain parameter around my house. I can also set a schedule on the WeMo app, which is useful for appliances with hard switches. An example of this is that my coffee machine has a physical switch to toggle it on/off, therefore I leave the switch in the ""on"" position and have my WeMo switch scheduled to turn on at a certain time every morning. This allows my machine to automatically start making my morning coffee. This will not work with an appliance such as a Keurig, as the switch is electronic (press the on button on the screen). The only change I would prefer is that the WeMo links directly to my Google Home app, so I can consolidate all the apps on my phone into one Smart Home App.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Solved my problem with no fuss,5.0 ,"I have a remote video camera in a Maine cabin. When the power goes off the camera boots up before the router and will not connect to the network. I then lose my view of the lake until my next visit when I just unplug and plug the power to the camera. With the WeMo switch smart plug I go on my phone, open the simple WeMo app. and power off and power on. The camera boots and I have my view. ( I have a Amcrest HD camera that works great). The switch was simple to install, do not rush, just follow the pictures. The only negative I found was that the WeMo plunged into the top outlet and did not allow me to plug anything into the lower outlet. I would also look at the WeMo Mini.

I used it during Christmas to use my basic old school Christmas lights to smart controlled lights.

"Bought one, had to get a second!",5.0 ,"I love this product. I set a rule to turn on in the morning (lamp). It hasn't failed once. It forces me to get out of bed. It's my back up morning alarm. It works great with Alexa. Alexa turns it on and off without any problems. I bought a second one for a living room lamp. I set some rules for that one too. Setting up the rules is easy. The second Wemo replaced a timer which was a little more difficult to set up. Note, the initial set up was a little tricky. I had to remove special characters from my wifi password. Nothing too complicated, just a little more time consuming than I expected, but after that, it works like a charm. Very happy. Once Wemo gets the light switches to dim, I'll be getting a few of those.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

really nice smart outlet,5.0 ,"This was easy to set up with google home, amazon echo/dots, and Smart Things hub. It has a big profile which makes it for top plug use if you need to use both plugs of an outlet, didn't realize they had a small profile unit too as I was trying to get an amazon discount that expired in minutes of my purchase and I was rushing. Works great so far and uses your home wireless lan, not Zwave or zigbee. Cost was less than my Smart Things Zwave outlets.

WeMo - don't waste money or stress on this,1.0 ,"Overpriced and underperforming. I have become used to seeing ""attempting to connect, still working, please wait"" but not to controlling my 6 Wemo switches without them dropping off the network, not being contactable, and being unable to correct problems without being in the same room as the Wemo - hard as I'm often in different country at the time. I also have Hive hub and sockets which work more reliably, can be controlled by Windows and Android (Wemo is Android/IOS only) which don't lose the network, and whose customer service is 100 times better than Wemo's. Forget Wemos, particularly if you are in a rush or not a high level techie. Hive is cheaper, easier and more reliable.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Does the trick. For a price.,4.0 ,So far so good. Linked it up with my Echo Dot and it controls my master bedroom lights. Perfect. It's a little big so you can only use one in a double outlet so I used a small extension cord as well. For that it loses a star.

Great product with room for improvement,4.0 ,"The WeMo light switch is a great concept with room for improvement. I like being able to control the lights inside my home when I'm away at night time. I have five WeMo devices and will continue to expand. I would like to see a camera for indoor and outdoor added to their already impressive lineup. I am able to use their light switch inside my home, however I wish I would be able to use it without the neutral wire (required). I have an older home and not all of my wiring has a neutral. I also would like to see a dimmer switch available! With room to improve, I can't give WeMo a five star review; however, with what it is now, and the potential that is has, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone wanting control over their lighting inside their home.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

So far it's been a joke. Just setting the thing up is ridiculous. It would not connect to our wifi so I called Belkin customer support. After holding for 23 minutes I spoke with a gentleman and he kept getting me to do the same actions over and over. Change rooms, same actions. Change plugs in the same room, repeat. After a hour (yes, really a hour) I mention that this could be a defective unit. He puts me on hold and gets approval for me to pay to have the unit sent back. Pay for the shipping on the new unit because yes, it is a defective unit. Thank goodness I'm a Prime member because I was HOT. Terrible customer service.

It's a good product. After buying this,4.0 ,"It's a good product. After buying this, the bulbs and switches, they all work good manually...i read the reviews about the scheduling/programming rules not working correctly for many many people. True, out of the box the firmware is likely old. After the devices updated, the rules worked better, maybe 90%... i still occasionally see my lights on when they should be off, or off when they should be on. I do not change the rules i just load the app (which needs a refresh) and resave the rules. During the short daylight days of winter, having your front lights on when you approach your home feels safer for driving and walking. I would consider the rules to be of utmost importance and should be perfect, but seems to be a long standing issue. Even with all the information on ITTT i cannot figure out how to get started.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

I also use one to turn my outdoor landscape lighting on and off, you can also set a schedule for the device to turn on and off. I just think the device should be a little bit cheaper. Set-Up is so easy no computer needed. Just download the WeMo app to your mobile device or tablet and put the device into an outlet. The WeMo app has great instructions. Just connect your device's wifi to the WeMo and open the WeMo app. If the installation fails, which it did for me. Just restart the process it seemed to work every time on the second try. The device will most likely require a firmware update after set-up the WeMo app will let you know. The app also lets you keep track of usage of the deviced that is plugged into the WeMo Switch.

This switch came into real good use during the summer. I have a one year old and NYC summers can be brutal with humidity so I installed the switch and plugged my living room air conditioner in it. When I was few minutes away I would just turn the switch one and my a/c would start. By the time we park and get into the apartment it was cooled down., perfect.

I really like the timer setting on it because I know at 4:30 p.m. My fish light is going to go on and I don't have to worry about it. One particular function that I find the most useful is the remote access capability.

... our WeMo for several months now and it works great with our Echo,5.0 ,We've had our WeMo for several months now and it works great with our Echo. We recently discovered IFTTT and now have our bedroom light come on at sunset and off with Echo. About a month ago we switched Internet providers. At first I couldn't get the switch to work with the new network. Then I googled my problem and found out the switch had to be reset. That turned out to be a breeze and we're back in business.

Works well.,4.0 ,"Over the past few years I've purchased a number of these to add to my hotch-potch smart home (consisting of a Nest Thermostat, 5xWeMo, 8xHue and a Yale Conexis L1). They sometimes have teething troubles but for 99% of the time they are 'other-half friendly' and work well. The app has improved over the years, it knows where the switches are geographically so can switch on or off based on local sunrise/set with any custom offset (I have a number of outside lights that turn on 15 minutes after sunset, then off 15 minutes before sunrise). Firmware updates appear to be pushed out every few months so it looks like Belkin are keeping on top of the various security threats you hear regarding IOT devices.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
How hard can it be to design something like this that would work 100%,1.0 ,First step is to connect the app to the adapter. It would connect and then disconnect after 10 seconds. All attempts and resets resulted in an error when trying to connect to the app. Returned the unit for a refund. Googled this unit and found too many people having the same problems.

This was twofold because home depot actually had a better price at the time and I didn't want to wait even for two day shipping. That said, setup was an easy <10 minute process following the directions and integration with our Echo (dot) was easy as well. These switches work as advertised and after two weeks I can honestly say that I still think it's cool when I can ask ""alexa"" to turn the lamps on and off. It's especially awesome when I've settled into ""the position"" with my feet up and drink in hand and realize I'm sitting in the dark.

Not so smart,1.0 ,"Really disappointing product. Apart from being a big bulky unit which will take up the space of 2 sockets, incredibly it actually took over 3 hours to install on the network. Once it was recognisable and (semi) functioning it knocked other device connections out, seemingly triggered by the firmware update. Then came setting up with Alexa....No device found. The online support Wemo provides is as useless as the product, so out of date that the instructions to set up Alexa still relied on a Skill (which is no longer available), where Amazon support advises you that Alexa should recognise the device automatically. Finally, after multiple attempts, increasing frustration, a factory reset of my router resolved everything.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Not worth the money,1.0 ,"This is a terrible device. Any power surge causes it to lose connect, then the headache begins. Setting up this device is not for the faint of heart. It literally takes me at least and hour to get it to work after it looses connection or even after there is a firmware update. My suggestion is to buy another option.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Still in development.,2.0 ,"I have had these switches for 10 days. In that time there have been at least a half dozen ""updates"" to the firmware.

Also, I am not able to program more than one ""on"" and ""off."" I want it to come on in the morning and off a couple of hours later, then come on again in the evening and off after we go to bed.

"Reliable wall plug switch, works with Alexa, Smartthings and Google Home",4.0 ,"Pretty dependable in most home automation environments, I recommend these plugs for certain devices and setups. I use mine to power on a TV and a PC monitor I have hooked up to Alexa and Smartthings. I use the widgets that come with the free app to turn these devices on and off or I just yell at Alexa to do it for me. Although the Alexa integration is pretty solid, the Wemo app itself is pretty wonky and sometimes doesn't read the status of my devices correctly. I have only had one instance where I could not get the app to properly shut off my devices, probably due to an IP conflict or something. A router reset quickly fixed the issue. Overall, these are some of the best plugs I have used. Unlike the new model, this model happens to be pretty large and will cover the second plug in your home, best to use a 1ft electrical extender.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Horrible if you ever have to change settings.,2.0 ,"I have two, and they worked perfectly until I changed ISPs. Now it constantly resets (every few weeks or maybe up to 2 months but sometimes daily), so I have to go through the cumbersome process of setting them up again.

I use them for the hard to reach sockets, one for the light and one for the TV so it doesn't sit on standby all the time, and it adds a bit of fun. Its cool to use the remote for Amazon Echo to switch on lights or telly as you enter a room rather than having to fumble around in the dark or put a light on to see where you are so you can put the actual light on that you intended. No hub or expensive start up kits needed with these as they stand alone and they work remotely via a smart phone or the Amazon Echo device. All you need is a WiFi connection, a smart phone and the ability to follow the simple set up instructions.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

"Works great,",4.0 ,"The switches work flawlessly. They only problem is there is part of the directions that I either fail to read or is simply not there. Make sure to turn off your mobile data on your android device (not sure about iPhones) when you first set it up. This forces your phone to use the Wemo switch as it's data source when setting up. If you change your modem or modem settings, you'll need to do it again. Other than that, works as advertized.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Then on those days when I leave the house and forget if I turned off my flat iron, all I have to do is open the app to know. IF I left it on, I can shut it off from almost anywhere.

Noisy! High pitched whine. But easy to setup. Works great with Alexa and IFTT.,1.0 ,"Easy to connect. Works great with Alexa and IFTT. Really Really Really noisy. Pros: It's very easy to setup. Plug it in, wait until you can find it's wifi signal, connect to it and open the WeMo app. After that, setting it up with alexa is even more simple. Just go to the Smart Home menu in the alexa app and tap Discover devices. You don't even need to enable the WeMo Skill! Cons: I was excited to get this item. However, right after i plugged it in, a really high pitched piercing whining sound started emitting from it. I continued to set it up, thinking it'll go away. But now that I've completed setup, and it's connected to my wifi, regardless of whether the output power is on or off, it continues to make the high pitched noise. It can be heard across the room! (see video for recording of the noise. Sorry to your ears.) It does what it's designed to do, but alas, I cannot recommend this.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Nice idea. If only it worked,1.0 ,"We bought this device because from the description it sounded like it was just what we were seeking. The good news is that it was easy to get it set up initially. However, when we moved the switch to a different outlet, or if the power went out, the device lost the connection to the internet which makes it unreliable for security purposes. We returned it for a refund and would not recommend to others.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Makes my life easier.,4.0 ,I love the Wemo line. they make my life easier. I have several. I wished New Zealand had the full line as I find the switch a little big and block out other sockets without using a double plug to move its bulk out of the way.. just a awkward size. I am disappointed that Belkin don't make a HomeKit bridge for this gear. As soon as I can get a HomeKit wifi product to do this then I'll swap but for now we have limited choice here. Overall though this is a great product.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Curate's Egg, mixed bag, whatever.",3.0 ,"I was pretty disappointed that this doesn't work with Logitech harmony and I don't really understand why it doesn't - apart from the general principle that the competition necessary for capitalism retards progress because cooperation between technical systems brings no immediate value to the participants. It switches off for no reason at certain times. Luckily it works with Alexa but she has to deal with my constant demanding to put the lights back on. Despite these problems, you can't beat the feeling when you roll in after a few pints, ears ringing from the band you just heard, and ask Alexa to turn on the lights as you collapse on the sofa. Despite the madness of the world right now it still feels like progress.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Very cool device!,4.0 ,"I originally bought one of these WeMo switches because I wanted to have my room lamps come on automatically when I was on vacation. Then I discovered how well they worked so I bought four of them. They rely on your WiFi system to operate, so you need to make sure it reaches as far as your farthest WeMo device. But after that, it's a no-brainer. You set up schedules or perform manual switching via a smartphone app. I can turn my lights on or off even when away from home. It's very cool! I would definately recommend WeMo to someone looking to automate their electrical devices.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Setup with Phone in Airplane Mode,4.0 ,Plugged in and took me a little while to set up. WeMo has a problem if your phone switches between 4G and your wifi when setting up the device. I fixed this by going to Airplane mode on my phone. WeMo suggests going to settings and turning something else off. It is so much easier just putting phone in airplane mode for the minute it takes to do the setup. Once I did that I had no problems. It has been a few weeks and no problems. I set up two switch smart plugs and an actual wall switch. Works good with my Google Home. Occasionally have to reboot app.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Should've listened to the negative reviews...,1.0 ,"I've been shopping online for more than 10 years and rarely do I ever write a review for a product. This is due in part to the fact that I research throughly anything I buy and am rarely ever disappointed enough to write a review. However, the WeMo Switch was very very disappointing. We needed something to control the heater so that we can turn on the heater remotely, such as on the way home, or through a schedule so I researched and came upon the WeMo switch. I initially read the negative Amazon reviews but decided to jump in anyways...big mistake. The biggest problem was I could never get the thing to connect to my wifi network. I tried changing the password, resetting, etc., and still no go. So the WeMo had to go back. If you're considering the switch, I urge you to read the negative (most helpful) reviews first.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Mediocre at Best,2.0 ,"The WeMo could be great but there are just too many shortcomings. The app is terrible. Every 3rd time I open it, I get a firmware notification and have to go through a rather annoying process of downloading the firmware update and frequently finding my switches to fall off the wifi network. The ""reset"" process is essentially pure luck. The directions are really not helpful. Ultimately its way more trouble than its worth because the time it takes to go through all the effort to open the app, troubleshoot and get the light on...you could just get up off your butt and flick a damn switch. It is nice to have the peace of mind when you arent home, but than again....thats assuming the switches are currently working.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

You can see devices with an Android App, upgrade firmware and create rules, label devices etc... It just fails on two small points - switching on when the rule says it should and then switching off when it is meant to. When you configure with an iOS device 1) It works every time; and 2) You get way more configuration options (like having it come on 15 mins prior to / after sunset) I would wait until they have the bugs ironed out","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

The problem I have had with it is the away mode timer or any off the timer options doesn't work properly. I set a time for 3hr and it will turn off in 5min.

I just have to do it manually on the app. I also did an update on the switch when I was away from home and after the update the switch was not available on the app. When I got home I had to unplug the switch from the wall outlet to restart it so it could show up on the app again.

Sometimes the light would turn on; other times not. I say about 25-40% of the time. If I closed the app and went back it it worked 75% of the time. I even deleted app, re-installed, reset smart plug and tried again. Same results. I was disappointed because this light is in a hard place to reach and I use it daily.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It's so nice to be able to set my timer for lights ...,5.0 ,"Just bought the Switch - have the mini plugs. It's so nice to be able to set my timer for lights on and lights off. Gone are those old, archaic, mechanical timers where you use the green and red pins to set the time. I always lost those pins and when the power went off it skewed the timer. Now I know - sunrise, sunset, the light is going on and off. Plus, as a bonus, I can activate it from my app anytime, anywhere. More Baby Boomers need to know about this devise! It's a game changer!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great for Home Security!,5.0 ,"I didn't buy this product through Amazon, but wanted to lease a review because of the usability of the product. I have attached the switch to a lamp and programmed top turn it on the in the evening. Its a great security product as well and came very handy when we were away from home and the light turned on for 3 to 4 hours every day. With my Nest cam, I was able to see that the lamp turned on and made me feel very secure. Would definitely recommend the product!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great & easy to use with Amazon Echo,5.0 ,"I have 4 of them and I've purchased 3 for my parents. They are incredibly handy, I started using my first one for a stubborn lamp that the knob was nearly impossible to switch on and off. It connects simply to the Amazon Echo and is nice to turn on light with voice commands, especially at night and in the morning.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works 90% of the time. Android setup takes real patience.,3.0 ,This thing works when it feels like it. it works 90% to 80% of the time but then there are times where it needs to be rebooted by unplugging. IF it were reliable and stable 99% of the time Id be much happier. The setup was awful daunting task on Android.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works great every time,5.0 ,I have been using the WeMo switch for some time now without any issues. I use it to control an older lamp with low wattage bulb via Amazon Alexa. The set up is simple to follow. Alexa found the item immediately and it has worked consistently ever since.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
WeMo Switch Smart Plug,5.0 ,This is the perfect safety solution for anyone walking into an unlighted area at night. We have our WeMo connected to a lamp in our living room. It's far easier to ask Alexa's to turn on than fumbling for a light switch. I wish I had one in every room.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works well with Alexa,4.0 ,"Just got this a few weeks ago. I set this up with my Christmas lights. Timer worked really nicely. Now that the lights are down, I am using it with a lamp. I have this connected with Alexa...works well. I just tell Alexa lights on or off...and she knows what to do.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Sometimes works,4.0 ,I have some trouble with it staying connected to the WiFi. When I changed my router it was difficult to switch over. I had to contact their customer service. When I ask echo to turn it off the response is sorry the Wemo is not responding so then I have to go to the app on my phone to turn it off.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Easy to setup and user friendly interface and reliable product.,5.0 ,Does what it is suppose to. The thing I like the most is the easy interface and setup. Anyone looking for a wireless switch should definitely consider these switches. I really hope that in the future the price drops since buying a few of these could put a little dent in your lighting budget :) Been using it for a month or so and really like it!,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
So neat!,4.0 ,"Got this as a gift and it is so neat! The set up was easy and it works great. It connects using your wifi. I'm not sure how it will work if I had multiple ones around the house, I do plan of buying more it's so convenient. But I've only had it for a week so don't know the long term use of it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works Like A Dream,5.0 ,"This is exceedingly simply to operate. We plugged the switch into the wall, plugged a lamp into it. Downloaded the app to our iphone. You need to sync the app to the plug, but this involves having the app on near the plug. After that, you are good to go. We tested it by driving away from the house and turning it on. Our son reported that the light went on with no problems. We were not able to use the app on oujr Kindle Fire. But on the iphone, it worked great.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It was very easy to put this device on my network at home,4.0 ,"It was very easy to put this device on my network at home. The only problem it is losing the signal every so often necessitating my turning it off and then back on again. I have it linked to my Amazon Echo - and the cool thing is that she says she cannot see it on the network when it loses the connection. BTW, the router and the WeMo are within 4 feet of each other, and no other devices are losing signal. I have the Mini switch now - just bought it actually a few days ago. So far, no problems at all with it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Love, love, love my WeMo Switch Smart Plugs!!!",5.0 ,"To say I love my WeMo Switch Smart Plugs would be an understatement! Being disabled, having the ability to just ask Alexa to turns lamps on and off is one (major) less worry I have. I'm now able to use those lights only when I need them, and not have to leave them on 24/7 (for fear of falling accessing them each time). This has to be one of the best inventions EVER! Highly, highly recommend!!!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Wemo Switch for smart home appliance control,4.0 ,"The Wemo Switch is very easy to set up and I had it operational and programmed within 5 minutes! I like that you can also control it with the Amazon Alexa service if you have an Echo or Dot. I use the Wemo Switch with a heat lamp for my tortoise so it switches on and off at a predetermined time. You can very easily manually override the schedule from the Wemo app both in and out of the house (i.e. even when you're not on your home wifi network). It's a great addition to any smart home setup. The only fault, if you can call it that, is that it could be made a little smaller. I now have six of these installed in my house!","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Nice and Easy to Use for Automating Your Home,5.0 ,"I purchased this switch for a floor lamp located in a hard to reach corner of my living room and it works perfectly. I was able to use IFTTT integration with the Triggers app on my Samsung Gear S2 so that I can turn the lamp on and off with just a couple taps on my watch's screen. I can also use the new Google Assistant to control the switch so if I'm feeling particularly lazy I can just ask my phone or tablet to turn on the lamp :) I've you want to integrate with your Apple Homekit, however, you'll need the Insight Switch. Apple Home doesn't detect this switch for some reason.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Really neat product,5.0 ,"I've been slowly starting to get into the whole smartphone craze and well I'm glad I got this product. Its pretty cool being able to control it from out and about . I was able to sink it with Alexa. It took a little longer to sink but if works fine. The only issue is that it is a bit bulky, I should have gotten the smaller one but it's my first product so next one shall be the small one..also the process to sink to wifi and my phone is a bit daunting...I wish it was a bit less process. Other then that it's a really great product. I am deffinatley purchasing more.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It is a horrible product and Belkin has not been helpful at correcting ...,1.0 ,"This product has been nothing but problems. I purchased it to work as a timer for a living room light. It hasn't worked right since I got it. The light does not turn on at the designated time. When I ask Alexa to turn it on, the light will go off randomly at a few minutes, an hour or a couple hours later, not the designated off time. I have reached out to Belkin's customer service. First I was told the firmware needed an update. Then my app needed an update. Then I needed to do a reset and start from scratch. Nothing has worked. It is a horrible product and Belkin has not been helpful at correcting the issue at all.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
5 Minutes and it's dead.,1.0 ,I ordered this in December 2016 and it has been sitting on my desk for awhile. So I opened it and tried to install it. The Wi-Fi for the device lasted about 5 minutes. I will see if I can talk to Belkin and if they can replace it. Now it is just an expensive manual on off switch.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
i love the idea of this,3.0 ,"i love the idea of this, but the usability needs work. the setup process errors out frequently and is slow and frustrating (it seems simple, and should be, but errors and app slowness makes it frustrating) once set up it works nicely, but is a little impractical. waiting for the app to ""search for devices"" takes way too long (sometimes) and for some reason my scheduled rule isn't working. a recent software update was slow and failed multiple times, the app left me wondering if it ever successfully updated. like the idea, and trust that it will get better in time, but for not it is a fun toy, but not yet a reliable tool.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Great device, still evaluating reliability",4.0 ,"So far this has been a good product.. My main goal was to use with my Echo Dot.. It works great most of the time, I did one less star because I frequently get that the plugs are unavailable from the Echo or the App will show one offline. All are in the same room as my wireless so the connection is not the issue. I will try and post again after I have some time with the device. I very much like having my lighting online and really enjoy the voice control. I am also using ITTT to control lighting with my Ring doorbell.. These plugs work great with all my home IoT.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Smart Switch Plug works great with Amazon Echo.,5.0 ,"Switch works great with Amazon Echo. We use this to turn on hot water heater recirculation pump on and off.

Good tool for legally blind,5.0 ,"Bought a pair to go with a Google Home that is installed in my mom's house.

"""Alexa, where is WeMo?""",3.0 ,"Overpromised with Echo: I purchased two of these devices to work with my 88 year old mother's Echo, one for the lamp and the other for the tv. The Echo could not find either device and there isn't any direction or guide on how to troubleshoot this particular issue. The setup only shows how to operate from your smartphone. I am still attempting to figure out how to get the devices connected to Echo so she can turn on and off both the lamp and tv with a verbal command as advertised. In the meantime, my mother is using the on/off button on the device to activate/deactivate the lamp and tv, so it is giving her an alternative for easier functionality but not what it was purchased for. Until I can figure out how to successfully connect to Echo, I will not be purchasing any other WeMo wifi devices.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great!,5.0 ,"Very impressed. Have used the old electro/mechanical timers in the past. The old one cost less, but wow, this is so easy to set, remote turn off and on. The away feature with random on off is well worth the extra cost. Good step to better home security.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great gadget.,5.0 ,"I love this thing. First I had to upload the software to my phone. Then follow the instructions to sink it to my home Wi-Fi using the program I uploaded to my phone. Took a couple of tries to get it all going, but it works great. You have to remember to turn the light on and off from the controller in the house. I can turn the light on when I'm running later than usual from my phone before I leave the office or while waiting at a stop light.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Works well; setup not so smooth.,4.0 ,"So far it works as intended, though initial setup wasn't as easy as it should have been. Once I got it connected to the WiFi and the iOS app, a message popped up for a firmware update and I initiated it. The update took a couple of hours to complete and once it did I was no longer able to connect to it from the app. I had to search Google on how to fix it and ended up restoring the device settings before it would work. Once I did that and set up the rules it started working as expected.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Could not find an easy way to use with Alexa without purchasing the terribly reviewed App.,1.0 ,"Bought to use with Alexa but could not find an easy way to set it up to work with Alexis without purchasing the WeMo App. On the box it said that the App was free. After looking at the App and seeing all the negative reviews, I decided not to purchase the App and return the item. Previously purchased 2 TP-Link plugs from Amazon that were relatively easy to set up and work fine with Alexa.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
i use them with Alexa (Echo Dot) and that was very easy to set up and use,4.0 ,"These switches work really well. i use them with Alexa (Echo Dot) and that was very easy to set up and use. There is a second or so delay which isnt a problem for me. The only reason i put 4* instead of 5* is that you cant use the appliance switches when plugged into these. there is a power button on them but they are veryt large and i wanted to hide them behind my desk. So now i can only turn them on and off via voice control (alexa) or the app (which I know i wont do). Overall, i think this is a good product and is reliable and easy to use. I just need to reconsider how i am going to use them.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

If you buy this you will regret it,1.0 ,"These devices worked great, till they didn't, and they did, then they didn't. Every couple months Belkin has released half baked firmware updates that require me to completely reset the device and delete the app from my iPhone and then reinstall it and reset all of the devices.

This product will not work with my android device and there is no support from the company!,4.0 ,"I finally used my iPad to get the thing to work now it works fine. I love it. Once set up -which was the problem- it now works on the Android device. What I like is that you can set up rules, and thus have the thing turn on and off an appliance (such as my water heater's circulation pump) as many times during the day as you want!! So now I am enjoying the unit and may purchase more because I love home automation! I have tried to get this product to work as advertised with my Samsung Note 3 phone. The WeMo won't connected with my phone and the corresponding newer duel band router. It will not let me connect to the WiFi on the phone so there is no control or visibility of the device. it is like a $50.00 plug with a manual switch on it. going though all the self help sites there does not seem to be a solution, as I have tried all suggested. the Parent company Belkin should not put out a product saying it will work on android devices when it won't work! Re-sets won't work. I guess I have to wait for a year or two to get my money's worth. But since this experience I will look at other home automation manufactures, I am sure there is something better out there, that might even work with a PC, and phone. I would not recommend this product nor will I go back to them.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Great great product,5.0 ,"Great great product. It was a good product at first, with the WeMo app. You can plug in lights to it and turn them off and on, or a dehumidifier, or whatever you want. But then they linked it up with Amazon Alexa, and now I can say, ""Alexa, turn off the lights"", and through WeMo, they go off. Sometimes it's a pain to link it to your wifi if you have a spotty connection, and if you get new internet and have to re-link it up, sometimes it's a hassle, but the pros vastly outweigh the cons with this Smart Plug.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Taking rocket science away from automatic timer switch,5.0 ,"I have bought three of these and several wall switches working together with two other traditional home automation brands and some other automatic timer. Wemo is by far the easier to use, to program and to manage. Some home automation brand would require their special hardware like a hub before one can get beyond just a timer. While a simple timer often require complex programming instruction. Without the original instructions, those switches become just paper weights. Wemo switches are different. They seem to remember their last setting even they are unplug. Plug them back in and they are ready to go.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
App won't work,1.0 ,I was excited to receive this. However after literally hours trying to get it to work. No go. I even purchased a tablet to see if it just did not like the phone. Nope. Still doesn't work. Router sees the device but WeMo app can't find it. Also looked online for help. Many others say the same. I hope the app makers fix this soon. It would be nice to use the device.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Still has kinks and bugs to be worked out. I have no trust in this product.,1.0 ,"These units are marginal at best. I have used them for a few months now and they constantly let me down. They fall offline. One way to restore a connection is to reset the unit. Another way is to uninstall and reinstall the app. In a reply from support at Belkin, they suggested I uninstall the smart bulb out of my porch light fixture and bring the bulb inside to be close to the ""Link Unit"" so it could be reset. Pain in the butt to do this. Sometimes they work pretty good, once they get online. I upgraded the phone app once and I had to start all over again resetting and re-linking to get them to work again. This is really bad Quality Control. They probably work pretty good in their lab but not in my house. I'm going to get rid of them and find another Home Automation solution.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
I bought a couple of the switches at Home Depot today & already returned them,1.0 ,"This is just a warning that not all plugs will fit into the Wemo Switch. I wanted to use the switches on two lamps -- both of which are fairly old. Neither could be plugged into the switches. I tried an adapter hoping that would plug in, but it wouldn't. Maybe the product is great if you have all new plugs, but in case you don't, beware. And by the way, both lamps and the adapter plug into my outlets just fine.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
It was easy to do after I watched a uTube video,5.0 ,The WeMo Switch works very well with Alexa. The only thing that needs improving is the instructions on how to connect to Alexa. It was easy to do after I watched a uTube video.

Great Device,4.0 ,"I didn't know I needed such a device but I received this switch and Alexa as a Christmas gift from my son. I currently use it on a bedroom lamp which I activate before entering the room. It's been installed for about a month, and it's working fine. It's great when entering the room (lamp is on other side of room) or when in bed. Ok, so I might seem a bit lazy but it's nice. I'm thinking of other applications for more switches in the house. I have not used it remotely from my iphone but I can definitely see some advantages there. Great device.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Other wifi plugs work much better than this one. It is nothing but a big headache.,1.0 ,Do not buy this if you want to use for Alexa. It simply does not work and Belkin's attitude is that as long at it works with their app they are not responible. I got so sick and tired of it not working right I demanded my money back. Frankly their attitude towards the problem only made it worse.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Wemo Switch - works as expected,4.0 ,"Had difficulty installing the software on my Galaxy Tablet, but it installed okay on my phone. The schedule feature is nice and what I used over the holidays. The switch had a quirk of turning off, and then a few minutes, turning back on. I was concerned that it was slightly warm to the touch, but after reading other reviews, I found out that was normal. I was able to have Alexa control the switch as well, which was a nice feature. Overall, it does what I'm expecting it to do. 4 stars instead of 5 because the software doesn't install on an Android 4 tablet but the documentation says it should.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
Weak wifi receiver.,3.0 ,I had a little trouble getting it paired up to my wifi. It took multiple attempts of going through the setup process to get it to work. I really liked the app interface. It had some decent features in the scheduling portion including a sunset to sunrise option. Ultimately I took it back because the wifi signal receiver was pretty weak. I had a fairly decent signal (2 out of 3 bars) on my cell phone and the wemo switch had nothing. So if you're not too far from your router this is a great product. I would have liked to see wink app integration some how.,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE
"Good, but needs better Google Home integration",4.0 ,"I really enjoy this product. It is easy to setup and very reliable. My only complaint would be that the Google Home integration should really be improved. While I do have a bunch of WeMo switches hooked up to my Google Home through IFTTT, the process for integrating WeMo with IFTTT and then programming IFTTT to work with Google Home was tedious and un-maintable. Bellini should really improve this if they want to claim they have integration with Google Home. Other than that, the product works really well. Very reliable, easy to use, does what it says, etc.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Confusing Set-up,4.0 ,"The installation was confusing, and I consider myself tech-savvy. It is loud when it turns on and off, as if an actual switch is being clicked as you turn it on and off with your phone. I will update in a few weeks about the use of the daily on and off timer.

The product works well and, in less than 10 minutes, I was able to set it up and control it via Amazon Echo just asking Alexa to turn it ON or OFF. Please be careful when writing or reading a review.

Connectivity issues -- ended up going with Insteon Starter Kit instead,1.0 ,"For starters, I'm an IT professional. I've been working with computers and networks for 18 years. I have an older home but I've been wanting to dip my toe into home automation. I figured the Belkin Wemo switch would be a good start. I purchased two of the switches at Best Buy for $50 each and brought them home. I plugged them in, downloaded the Wemo app on my iPhone 5 running iOS 7, and switched over to the Wi-Fi network created by the switch. I proceeded to enter in my home Wi-Fi network credentials for the 2.4 GHz band and then I updated the firmware on the switch per the prompt. The firmware update took a few minutes and then the Wemo rebooted on its own. As an aside, I have two AirPort Extreme routers (one extending the range of the other). I have my router set up for 2.4 GHz a, b, and g and 5 GHz N bands but the Wemo is not compatible with 5 GHz. When Belkin says it's not compatible with 5 GHz, they're not kidding. I've interacted with other devices cross-band on my Wi-Fi network before with no problems; but somehow, Belkin has engineered a product that cannot be interacted with from a smartphone that's technically within the same network but is running on the 5 GHz band. So, I had to ""forget"" the 5 GHz network on my iPhone and join the 2.4 GHz network in order to interact with the Wemo over Wi-Fi. With my iPhone 5 on the 2.4 GHz band and the Wemo also on the 2.4 GHz band, I launched the Wemo app again, tapped the ""on"" button for the switch and the light attached to the switch came on. Neat! I tapped the button again to turn the light off and the light stayed on. Hmmm, not good. I closed the app entirely on my iPhone and went back in and now the ""power"" button for the switch was grayed out on my screen. I figured power cycling the Wemo would fix this so I unplugged it, waited a few seconds, and then plugged it back in. This time, I was able to turn the light off but when I went to turn it back on a few seconds later, nothing happened. The Wemo had seemingly lost Wi-Fi connectivity again. Thinking a reset of the Wemo would fix this issue, I reset it, connected to its own Wi-Fi network again, and reconfigured it to join my 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. After completing the setup again, I had the same results. The Wemo would stay connected long enough for me to interact with the switch immediately but then it dropped the connection. Keep in mind that all the other 2.4 GHz devices in my home had full signal strength when sitting directly in front of the Wemo so signal strength was not the problem. Maybe I just got a bad unit but it left a bad enough taste in my mouth that I didn't even bother opening the second Wemo switch I'd purchased. I took them both back to Best Buy and exchanged them for the Insteon Starter Kit. I brought that kit home and within 25 minutes, I had the iOS app downloaded, the Insteon hub hooked up to my router and talking to both my 2.4 and 5 GHz networks, and the two included dimmer switches fully operational both inside and outside my network. If you're looking to dip your toe into home automation a little bit at a time like I am, do yourself a favor and read up on the Insteon system. For only $20 more than two of these Wemo switches, you get two dimmer switches and the Insteon hub. The dimming is optional, by the way -- you can just use them in either off or full on mode; but being able to also dim a light is a nice touch. The dimming even works with the energy saving ""curly cue"" bulbs. The Insteon system simply has a lot more expandability for the long term than this Wemo system from Belkin; and in my experience, the Insteon system is much easier to set up and is much more reliable than the Wemo system.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Wemo keeps improving,4.0 ,I've owned a demo smart switch for years now. When I first got it I experienced disconnects often and honestly put it aside. I've been using it again now and I'm extremely happy with the solid connection. I've added 3 motion sensors and 3 light switches. I'm glad to see the improved layout of the mini outlet. A dimmer switch and lower cost on the Maker unit would greatly improve the product line.

Wifi connection worked when I tried another device,4.0 ,"I already had a WeMo switch that I got in 2013, and which I have had no trouble with at all. But when I went to add a second one I just received, it absolutely would not connect to our wifi. I was trying to set it up through my iPhone. After no luck, I decided to try setting it up with my iPad. It worked! The switch connected right away AND showed up in the WeMo app on my iPhone as well as my husband's phone and iPad. So... if the switch isn't connecting to your wifi, try connecting thru another device. Beyond that, I love this switch. I haven't had any trouble with it and love being able to turn things on and off from anywhere. The first one is hooked up to our swamp cooler, which is a very primitive machine with no thermostat or anything. Thanks to the WeMo, we can now program it to turn on and off whenever we want it to.

Worth it.,4.0 ,"Quick and easy to setup and user. The app works fairly well and is very straightforward. One minor annoyance is that when using the app to turn the Switch on/off, after pressing the power ""button"" it lags as if its going to turn the switch on/off but then leaves it in the same on/off state it was in when you pressed the button. Pressing the button a second time always works.

"Not reliable for security uses, wrong technology architecture choice (i.e., Zigbee mesh better than WiFi)",1.0 ,"I purchased to use as security lighting while away from home, programming On/Off times with IFTTT. The intent was to replace inexpensive lamp timers. My experience is that WeMo connectivity is completely unreliable because of totally random WiFi connectivty to IFTTT. Sometimes they turn on; often, they don't. If they do turn on, it is random that they turn off at the IFTTT programmed time. I have similar problems with Nest thermostats, but they are less critical since they are not timing dependent as are IFTTT programs. I think this is due to a serious architectural flaw, ie. each module depends on its own separate WiFi connection. There are alternative wireless networking technologies (other than WiFi) which appear much more reliable for this particular application purpose, ie. the Zigbee mesh wireless network in which each device can talk to another device.....as implemented with the Philips HUE LED bulb products. I have had no connectivity reliability problem with using Philips Hue LED bulbs timed by IFTTT programs.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Does Not Work with Android Smartphone,1.0 ,"I received a WeMo Switch for Christmas, and could not get through the initial setup using my Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) smartphone. It would sporadically connect to the WeMo wireless signal, but would invariably drop the connection before the setup was complete. I called Belkin support and they recommended trying the setup with an iPad or iPhone. There is no alternative setup for Windows available and I do not have an Apple device, so I had to return the WeMo for a refund.

I had to factory reset it and start all over. Went through setup again and had a difficult time trying to connect the light switch to my wifi. Finally I got through and it connected, set it up and done. I'd say that was 8 months ago. Recently, I had to restart my router and had to setup the light switch again. It's still not connected. With the most updated firmware, it's still a crap software. The window to connect to the lightswitch is like finding a needle in a haystack. I still haven't gotten it to connect after an hour or plugging it in and out. I'm going to throw this on the freeway. Never again will I purchase a Belkin product.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Works fine but is a little power hungry,3.0 ,"The product works as advertised. It was easy to set-up. The WeMo app turns an appliance on and off like it is supposed to. That said, it can't be recommended for trying to save energy. According to the Kill-A-Watt meter, it eats 23.5 watts even when the appliance it is controlling is turned-off. For comparison, an Apple 802.11ac wireless station uses 17 watts, a VTech wireless phone uses 2 watts, a Phillips 60 watt equivalent LED lightbulb uses 11 watts, and a AT&T microcell uses 20 watts.

The devices can find the WiFi signal through several walls if the devices are within 25 feet from the router. Beyond 25 feet is problematic with my router.

I am not impressed,2.0 ,"I bought a couple of these Belkin switches (not on Amazon). The installation was not easy as the WeMo app leaves you on your own before installation and firmware upgrade is done. In my case, I had to repeat the installation and the firmware upgrade twice for each switch before it was finally complete. The LED indicators just add to confusion as the seem to blink almost randomly. The switches did not work on my guest Wi-Fi. The indicator kept blinking amber, which was supposed to mean 'no connection'. However, the switches responded if my phone was on the same guest network. The switches were 'not detected' over the phone cell connection though. I had to re-set the switches to move them to my non-guest Wi-Fi. The response time to a turn on/off request varies: sometimes it is almost instantaneous; sometimes it takes 3-7 seconds; especially over the cell connection. The switches hum noticeable, especially during the setup and when not loaded. You can hear a switch in a quiet living room. They turn on and off with a loud click. Away Mode rule does not work reliably. For instance, when it was time to turn on, only one switched turned on; the other stayed off even though both switches were included in the Away rule. But the worst part is that the switches turn on and off randomly during the day without any visible reason. This makes the product practically unusable for me. I hope this will be fixed either by the firmware, the app or the backend software upgrade.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

What I think got it working (finally) was changing the WiFi router's mode from b/g/n mixed networking to b/g mixed networking did the trick. I won't confirm that though; it was so painful getting to that point that I'm not ready to erase the configuration and try again. That said, it's just a switch so there's not much more to say about it.

WeMo IsWorthless,1.0 ,I bought 2 for a second home in a cold climate. One was for lights in a bedroom and the other was for a space heater in the kitchen in case the temperature dropped and pipes were subject to freezing.

Cool idea but unreliable,3.0 ,"The idea of controlling your lamps, coffee makers, etc. over the Internet sounds very Jetsons, but in practice, it isn't as reliable as the good old timer that you use to turn lights on and off while you're away. This switch was very easy to set up using the four-step process in the box (you need an ios or android device to use the app that controls it). I connected it to a living-room lamp and was able to switch it on and off easily both within my network and on a different network. You can buy additional switches and give them different names on your app. It would be awesome except the switch frequently disconnects from the network for some reason. When it does that, I have to press the button on the switch itself to turn it back on. That would make this very impractical if you're trying to control lights in a second home or if you're away for an extended period. I also can't get used to searching for my ipod to turn on or off the lamp instead of just reaching over and turning it on or off. Overall this seems kind of gimmicky, a solution looking for a real problem.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Easy to install,5.0 ,This is an awesome device. I received it as a gift and was a little apprehensive because I'm not very tech savvy.

They connect easily and have never failed,5.0 ,"I've had two of these for over a year now and recently added a third.

Didn't last long,2.0 ,"I purchased two of the WeMo switches and had intermittent problems getting them to be recognized by the iPhone. In spite of that, I still got value from the switches. Until yesterday. After just over a year of use, one of the switches died completely yesterday. It no longer generates any blinking lights when I plug it in, isn't found by the iPhone app, and no longer runs the rules that I had set up. I'm guessing that the wi-fi component died, but it is now beyond the 1 year warranty and there is really no support/trouble shooting information for this problem on the website. On the whole, not worth the money I spent for it.","WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa",B00BB2MMNE

Junk!,1.0 ,Amazon would not post my review without being specific so here goes. App does not work with device. QR scan in app does not scan ansd when you try to set up manually the pin code that is printed on device says that it is wrong. I can't tell you how much time i spent trying to make this work to no avail. I am going back to quality products and forget all about D-Link. Do not waste your money as this will definitely disappoint you!,"D-Link Smart Plug, Energy Monitoring, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant (DSP-W215)",B00K4YEI28
Setup is nearly impossible,1.0 ,"This Smart Plug is not very smart. Every other smart product I have used has allowed one to establish automation rules with triggering conditions - where a basic action on the device (such as turning it on or turning it off) is a valid triggering condition. Not so on this device. So, for example, if you wanted to set a rule of ""When this Smart Plug is turned off, also turn off my other Dlink Device"" or ""When this Smart Plug is turned on, turn it off 10 minutes later [to conserve elecricity]"", you cannot. On top of that, setup was unreliable. I had to perform >every single step< at least twice to get it to work, and some steps never succeeded. - My modern smartphone was unable to successfully perform the first step - scanning the QR code on the device. The QR code was not only tiny, but the ink was smeared such that my phone was unable to interpret it. - Manual setup (without the QR code) requires you to know what hardware version you have. There is no ""hardware version"" label on the device. So you have to look for any random letter-number combinations on the back of the device to see if any of those match the hardware version choices you are presented with in the setup app. - One step requires you to enter a PIN. It failed to accept the PIN, and I had to kill the setup app, restart the Smart Plug (unplug it and re-plug it), and only after all of that did it accept the PIN. (Not to mention that the PIN is on the back of the device, which you cannot see when the plug is plugged into the wall!) Overall, the setup experience was frustrating at best. If you DO decide to purchase this device, take a photo of the backside. You'll need several bits of information (such as the device PIN) during setup, all of which you will be unable to see when the device is plugged into the wall.","D-Link Smart Plug, Energy Monitoring, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant (DSP-W215)",B00K4YEI28
"Get the DSP-W110 instead, it will save you TIME and you can get on with your life!",1.0 ,"What a mistake in buying this, I should have stuck with the DSP-W110 version (which I haven't updated firmware yet). Let me start by saying this booger had problems from day 1. Hard to connect compared to the 110, would drop out repeatedly during the day when the 110 is 3x further from the wifi router and it stays connected. Then it had a mandatory update, which I tried per their app instructions. What a waste of time, it can't figure out if its connected or not, then wants you to try different things like ""turn off mobile"". I had a direct and persistent wifi connection from my android phone to it. All the app offers you is to try different things, but still failed to connect it to the wifi router. I want to trade this in for the 110, I'm done with this piece of work. How did this pass internal quality checks? I'm guessing it doesn't. Before I forget, when I did wifi into the 215, I started walking into the other room and the connection fell to 1 bar. Right, barely 25' of range. Pity, it could be much better, but it isn't. No, I'm not upgrading my other one, and don't force me to either, at least its reliable!","D-Link Smart Plug, Energy Monitoring, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant (DSP-W215)",B00K4YEI28

"Worked fine for me, am I one of the lucky ones?",5.0 ,"I almost didn't buy this because of the reviews. If you have ever read a list of reviews before, you know that the 'Star' rating might go down because somebody gave it 1 Star due to the fact that they didn't read the manual or didn't think to plug it in. However, the D-Link Smart Plug had many reviews saying it was hard to set up, won't detect, firmware update loops, registration code is invalid. When it went down $5, I took it as an Omen and bought it, prepared to spend two hours jacking with it. Nah, plug it up, wait for green light, hit WPS on it and the router annnd done. It did require a firmware update after it was already set up from 1.22 to 1.23 but nothing went wrong. I timed it, local or remote, if you hit the power button for it on the MyDlink Home app, it will power off in under 4 seconds. I do wish it had the capability to turn off at a certain time. This device has my wife's hair dryer plugged into it and I would like for it to power off at 9AM, well after she has already left for work. I'm sure the IFTT integration will have that recipe.UPDATE: Yeah, IFTTT works great with this. If for some reason my wife is still home after 9AM when it shuts off, she can just hit the power button on the smart plug, no biggy.","D-Link Smart Plug, Energy Monitoring, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant (DSP-W215)",B00K4YEI28

"Product works, app is terrible.",2.0 ,"D-Link fails greatly across their product categories with App building. This plug is functional. And a great idea. However, the app interface STILL has not been updated to be satisfactory (this review is over a year after the product was purchased - app still sucks). Take a gander at app reviews for D-link apps.

The companion app is also nice and is very intuitive. Also configured it to work with Google home. Again took less than 5 mins. The only thing I feel missing is integration with home automation hubs. I have Samsung Smartthings hub but this plug does not integrates with it. It would have been great if I can control this device for my Smartthings automation just like my other devices. That is why I am taking a star away but otherwise it's a great plug.,"Smart Plug works with Alexa, No Hub required, voice control by Amazon Echo, FCC and ETL listed, Easy installation and App control like a Smart Switch On / Off / Timing",B0746FZJ95
