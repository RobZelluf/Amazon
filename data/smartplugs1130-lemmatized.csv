five stars,5.0,i ve been installing these in my house a well a a few buddy for home automation a few note on these if your looking to automate your home this is the best device i ve seen for z wave i personally have been using smartthings a a note to those who are looking to do ha as others have noted led is on by default but is easily changed i changed my to on only when the light is on the bedroom because i didn t want the light to shine in the room during the night however in the kitchen i have the led on when the light is on and v by far these switch are going to run you about 10 more than the competition but your going to save some time and effort with this switch the box come with the neutral wire which most do not and it a pain to make your own all the time given unlike the others out there your house wire plug into the switch this is an advantage for sure since you don t need wire nut likewise if your short on room in a box this is perfect the others out there have wire coming off the back of the switch and add more of a mess inside the electric box if you like this review please indicate so by clicking the box below,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
good but check your wiring,5.0,you need to check your wiring before ordering these these switch require 3 wire load line and neutral some of my light switch box do not have a neutral and our electrician could not get the switch to work called the company to confirm apparently lowes ha some z wave switch which do not require the neutral wire i m giving a 5 star since it is not the fault of the switch just do not want someone else to run into my difficulty,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

easy to install,5.0,i wa amazed at how easy this wa to install the instruction are clear and the terminal are well labeled it even came with the neutral wire i installed one in the garage to control my coach light via wink and alexa it is so nice having the light on a programmed schedule now using the dimmer i can dial down the brightness with either the switch or my mobile app,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works great when the household wiring allows installation,4.0,i am told by my installer that there are 7 accepted way to wire switch to light but only 1 of which is compatible with z wave so for now we re limited to where we can install these switch which of course is not where i prefer to have them installed we are still researching if anyone ha any advice please leave a comment so i can have the switch installed and update this review my recent immersion into z wave wa the trane tzemt400bb3nx n n sl home energy management thermostat with nexia home intelligence white z wave and the schlage fe599grnx cam 619 acc 619 keypad lever home security kit with nexia home intelligence satin nickel z wave however i learned from a customer service rep at nexia that only powered component thermostat light switch outlet etc will act a repeater and battery operated component entry door lock dead bolt motion sensor will not act a a repeater hence the cause of my dropped connection to my thermostat and he highly recommended i add more powered component to my network thanks justin hence i ordered a small pile of these switch that i now unfortunately cannot use due to the wiring in my home in the single location we were able to install one of these switch it s working great using my nexia account the driveway light now turn out automatically 30 minute prior to dusk and turn off at a preset time then during the preset off time until a preset time in the morning the switch is part of a scene activated when there is motion detected on the driveway and then sends u an alert email and text message after a no motion message is passed back to the system this switch is then sent a message to again turn off but only during those very late night hour i have yet to see an off the shelf light that could be programmed to do this elaborate programming very nifty the quality of this switch is superb the functionality is superb but i m docking a star due to the lack of feasibility in many wiring configuration,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
probably the best option for z wave smart switch,4.0,great product i replaced over a dozen switch in my home to enable voice command using the wink hub and amazon echo i chose the ge smart switch since it support 3 way configuration where you have more than one switch that control the same light fixture and us z wave technology a opposed to a vendor specific offering like lutron caseta i love the blue indicator light easy to see in the dark that illuminates whenever the light is off attaching and removing electrical wire to and from the switch is simple just tighten the corresponding screw no soldering the ground wire or fumbling a push in style switch to release the wire not sure if that make the connection le secure though be aware the switch is larger than a standard toggle switch though so it take up more space in the box and leaf le room for all the wire you may have to spend some time arranging the wire before screwing in the switch or cram really hard i did that once and the neutral wire detached from the screw nut i also had to repeatedly remove all the side bar the three prong that stick out on the side to get them to fit next to each other but presumably they re useful in certain installation and wa only annoying because i had more than a dozen to install the dimmer function itself is also a little sub optimal if you re accustomed to a slider to control the brightness for the smart switch it s variable depending on how long you toggle the switch how long you hold the on or off position and that can result in what feel like a slight delay between the time you press the button to when the light dims or brightens,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
i am not sure why others have bashed this a,5.0,i am not sure why others have bashed this a not being well made it is typical construction with a very heavy aluminum front plate the screw for clamping the wire were typical construction and allowed normal tightening without stripping fyi be sure you read the instruction and take note about the pairing distance of 10 or le the short pairing distance is the design of the z wave interface not a problem with this device if you are pairing this to a fixed alarm panel or similar device you may need to power it up with an extension cord and place it near the z wave host for pairing once you have registered it with the host you can power it down then install it in the switch box,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
these are an excellent way to save from having to purchase a bunch,4.0,these are an excellent way to save from having to purchase a bunch of smart led light and instead just change the outlet for example say you have a living room with six can light if you bought six hue bulb so you can remotely control the light with your phone you would need to spend 60 bulb x 6 with this outlet you need just one outlet note the outlet i am reviewing is only an on off and doe not have a dimmer function see dimmer smart switch which is 10 more than the standard the reason i only gave it 4 5 star is due to it huge size and amount of real estate it take up in the switch box it ll be just fine if you are installing it in a stand alone box but if you are trying to install it a shared box you will not only have trouble but run out of room quickly the box say you can bend the side metal plate and then provides amp instruction for maximum amount of amp but my electrician tell me that s a bad idea a they need room on the side i know there are a lot of review complaining about the different look of the switch sticking out horizontal rather than at an angle but the reason for this is the switch is always active for use by a person in location touching the switch or remotely e g by a phone the smart bulb for example always have to be on and if i have one installed on a floor lamp and the lamp is switched off i cannot control the light remotely from my phone for example however with this outlet even if they have manually been turned off you can still control them remotely from my phone or ipad for example since the switch is always on hence the reason it s always in the middle position overall very happy with the product and plan to order many many more given space in my box,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
this wa very easy to install and then add to my smartthings network,5.0,this wa very easy to install and then add to my smartthings network had it up and running in very short order i like that using this outlet allows me to set smartthings to automatically turn on my living room light at sunset and then turn it off at 11pm i used to use a plug in timer and it wa a pain to keep adjusting the on time a the time it get dark varies day to day it s also nice if i want it on to say echo turn on the living room light,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
z wave beaming relay help tie multiple distant z wave items together,4.0,i bought this because of it s beaming feature i didn t really need a light but i had several z wave deadbolt in my house that were located to far away from one another to complete the z wave mesh network since they re battery powered lock they need a device with beaming feature to serve a a relay hub and this fit the bill nicely as others mentioned it s a little tricky to install just because it need three wire where many switch will only have two a third neutral connection is required since the switch itself need to be powered in addition to switching the load off and on to whatever you re actively switching pairing it with my vera controller wa something of a pain and i had to consult a few web forum it seems the initial connection can be hard to make but once it s made it stick just fine it took me probably 10 12 attempt just repeating the pairing process over and over again until my vera unit flashed it leds at me indicating a proper handshake after the initial setup however the switch ha performed exactly a expected i have it turning an exterior porch light off and on per scene definition in vera my initial reason for buying it to serve a a hub relay for my z wave deadbolt worked great too where i had several too far away to consistently report into vera with this in the mix i get solid connection to them all,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
my first choice for smart light control,5.0,let me start by saying that i have a large number of smart device in my home all integrated through wink i have lighting controlled by a variety of mean including bulb and smart outlet on power strip this smart light switch by ge is by far the most reliable way to have smart light control for a quick comparison of the method i have used smart bulbs very convenient and work in any light fixture that the bulb fit into convenience is the biggest factor and they are relatively inexpensive if there are few bulb in the fixture however if you have fixture with more than 3 bulb smart switch become a more affordable option the downside to these in my experience seems to be that they are more annoying to set up le reliable and resetting can be very difficult if they aren t working properly if you don t get the on off pattern timing perfect they won t reset of the many smart bulb i put in a combo of cree connected and ge link i had multiple that required multiple reset and were not always responsive in addition the bulb always need power to work with smart control so if someone hit the light switch to turn them off you can t turn them back on with smart control like wink smartthings or amazon echo one last downside is that each bulb is triggered with it own command from the smart home management system so they come on in a wave one upside to these is adding smart control to a ceiling fan running off of only one wall switch with the ceiling fan you can put in smart bulb and use those to control the light without turning off the whole fan if you don t want to use the cord smart switch definitely my favorite method these are extremely reliable in comparison to other method only took me 1 try to get each of them connected to the hub and they have always responded since i set them up a few week ago i have never had to reset any of them in addition you can turn the light off at the switch and still have them work with your smart home configuration if you want to turn them back on the downside is the price a smart bulb are often found for 10 15 each so if you don t need more than 3 the switch is definitely more expensive in addition installation is a bit more complicated a you have to wire the switch into the wall whereas bulb can just be plugged in a usual smart power strips i have the pivot power genius it is a bit slow and somewhat unreliable it frequently turn off on it own it is very inexpensive now but just a reliable lighting control i don t recommend this method i can t compare to other smart outlet though in short this switch is great it is reliable relatively easy to install and not very expensive if you want smart control in a fixture with more than 3 bulb this is the way to go if you want smart control for fixture with le than 3 bulb and don t mind the extra cost this is the way to go eventually i plan on replacing a many smart bulb a possible with these smart switch because they are much more convenient to use and much more reliable i would highly recommend this smart switch because it work so well and is le expensive than competitor switch like leviton awesome product,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
just work,5.0,installed several of these and everything went smoothly they are wider than a standard toggle switch but still fit in all the panel i even have one triple switch panel and they fit side by side after installing them i flipped on the switch then went to the z wave controller and it automatically detected and added the device no having to mess with tamper switch like other z wave device which this doesn t have anyways i know some people were wondering about whether the neutral connection is required i do have the neutral wire and it wa necessary to connect the neutral before the switch worked so i cannot comment on if the neutral connection is required if you don t have the neutral wire,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works with metal switch plate and plastic electrical box in my installation,5.0,i wa hesitant to install this in a 4 gang plastic switch box with a decorative metal switch plate i wa worried that the metal plate would interfere with the signal however it work perfectly probably because of the plastic box the switch is about 20 foot from the smart things hub on the next floor the response time is about 2 second using my smartphone out of range of my local wifi network using 4g phone network and instantaneous when the phone is connected to my local wifi now that i know this work so well i will be adding several more things to my system it would be a minor but nice improvement when adding device if the smart things app would pop up a message telling you to tap the device switch to sync instead of just showing it is searching for device a the rotating symbol spin around this is covered in the written instruction but it is easily overlooked,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
installed easy and work well,5.0,was a bit apprehensive about this a my first attempt to install a z wave light control the instruction were easy to follow but i ve basic understanding of electrical wiring and did some basic work at home previously the unit itself it much larger than a standard light switch make sure you have enough space to install this i had to move some wire around to make this fit but mainly due to the wiring work of the electrician who wired the house once installed setting it up wa not difficult my controller wa able to recognize it quickly and everything wa up and running in minute so nice to be able turn my light on off when i m not physically near the switch a little bit pricy though,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
with alexa you cannot go wrong,5.0,this we just installed vivint smart home security system and added an amazon echo and i love it all i have to do now is say alexa kitchen light on and bam it s on when i m done alexa kitchen light off and go about my mary little way may seem lazy right not when the builder of your home put the light switch to the kitchen down the hall and about the equivalent of two bedroom away from the edge of the kitchen who doe that now i dont have to run down the hall like zombie are chasing me to turn the kitchen light on when i m down for a midnight snack love it and plan to do my whole house a few at a time also with our vivint system and echo we do not need the base for this a it tie directly into vivint and alexa access the switch from there,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
good would be great with the inclusion of led indicator great way to automate home light,4.0,the reason i m giving this 4 5 star is that pricing should be cheaper being that there isn t much tech going into the add on switch not only that but i wish ge incorporated the led light onto the add on switch a well so you can easily locate the switch in a dark room but let s talk about why it did earn the 4 star first of all they were fairly simple to install paired easily with my samsung smartthings hub gen 2 and have been working reliably since i can also easily control the light through amazon s alexa enabled device but that s because of interoperability between alexa and samsung please be sure to check and make sure you have a neutral wire available before ordering this switch or it s counterpart also i m not an electrician by any mean but am a self taught handyman and i believe almost anyone can install this light with the help of google,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
it worked like a charm,4.0,i bought this a my first z wave light switch to test it out i have a homeseer setup with a aeotec z stick for the software and controller hardware first the installation process in summary the switch feel very solid and well made instructions are very simple and do not explain everything you need to know i will buy more now that i know what to do this took me more than a little while to do because the instruction were not very clear the diagram indicates you only have to connect the hot and line wire to light it show the ground and neutral a optional i connected the ground but not the neutral after trying everything i could think of i finally gave up and called tech support the tech informed me that i had to connect the neutral switch for it to work he explained that i needed to take the little white wire included with the box and connect it to the bundle of white wire in the box not explained in the instruction after that it worked like a charm the instruction also don t explain how to initiate pairing the tech told me to turn the power on and then back off to initiate pairing it worked on the first try with my z stick,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
often the gang box isn t deep enough to hold all the wire easily and requires some force to get everything in place,4.0,very difficult to fit into multigang box often the gang box isn t deep enough to hold all the wire easily and requires some force to get everything in place if there wa a way to make these smaller so they fit into normal gang box easier that would be a major improvement with this device functionally they work perfectly i wa able to get smartthings to control this device very easily upon applying power and even get amazon alexa to control it a well i would like to put more of these in my house but the difficulty of installation ha made me double think that,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
pool light application conversion and alexa integration,4.0,ihave had this installed for about two week now took a while to convert everything from incandescent to led and then to this switch didn t realize at first i needed neutral wire had to run a neutral line to box i used this outside for my pool light on my swimming pool remains to be seen if this can hold up in the phoenix az summer and not fail i think it said rated to 104 degree f definitely get a lot hotter in the summer plus this switch is enclosed in a metal junction box i never thought the z wave function would transmit in this metal enclosure but it doe i also interfaced it with alexa and samsung smarthings all work well except the dimming function is not accurate percentage of dimming on the app doe not correlate well perhaps related to the type of led bulb i have in my pool now when i want pool light on i just say alexa pool light on or off pretty cool i have a spa light and also waterfall that are now potential for home automation this home automation stuff can go on and on definitely cool converting over incandescent bulb to led and then to automation definitely requires some electrical and mechanical skill on your part you are pushing the envelope and could not have done it without some forum like on amazon to answer question and multiple internet inquires to understand limitation and technicality but it is fun and keep my brain engaged,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
just want i wanted,5.0,they seem to be well manufactured and solid but do they work yes this product is exactly a described pay attention to the direction the direction are very clear i first purchased two ge 12723 add on switches with one ge z wave wireless lighting control dimmer switch in order to test them out before buying them for the entire house i ran several test first i connected the controller dimmer by itself with one incandescent light and one led light in a a two way configuration everything worked fine then i added one add on switch so now we have a three way configuration everything worked fine then i added the second add on switch now we have a four way configuration everything worked fine in other reading and review i heard that some dimmer have problem with low load on the line the dimmer would not turn on at all so i removed the incandescent light leaving only one 5 watt led light now you can t get much lower load than that happily the switch worked flawlessly that s it for the actual review but here is a little background in my last home ten year ago there were few option for automation at that time i did a lot of research and decided on lutron radio ra a proprietary system i have to say that system wa solid expensive but solid it never failed needless to say i wa very happy with it for over 5 year until i wanted to add to it then i discovered that lutron discontinued radio ra and replaced it with radio ra ii which wa not downward compatible so my only option were to replace everything in my house or buy used if i could find it i felt that lutron betrayed there original customer by not supporting the first version so on my new home i have decided to use an open architecture type system and i have decided on zwave now i can buy all of the component part from many company hub switch sensor everything and i am no longer dependent on a single proprietary company with open architecture you have more option more development more competition which all lead to more innovation and lower price today there are aspect of zwave product that need improvement but it s getting better every day and more and more company are getting on board if one company abandon zwave there are many more out there to choose from,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

love installing without a neutral,5.0,love love love being able to have a new switch available that doesn t require a neutral even though i have a brand new house there happened to be two switch that didn t have a neutral so now i m able to get the rest of my light and switch automated also before i switched out to my incandescence bulb the cfls flickered like crazy it s mentioned in the description of the product no cfls and no led light on this switch i assumed that to mean because of the fact there s always current running through the circuit and those type of bulb would never fully turn off cfls and leds do work with the ge switch that require neutral though,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
very nice feature we never have to worry about touching,5.0,i use this with the adt pulse system to control a light with a camera we have an outdoor camera that over look a certain door at our house normally we leave the light off because no one is ever out there however i wa able to program this successfully to turn on only at night when that camera detects motion it work very quickly in fact i approached it from several different angle and each time the light turned on in enough time to get full hd color shot of the person around the door window the camera over look once the camera go 15 min without detecting motion it turn the light back off very nice feature we never have to worry about touching the light switch either a i wa working on the house and motion feature tied in to adt kept the light on until i left we also never worry about leaving the light on installation wa easy but some note 1 you must have 3 wire minimum to use this in the switch box line hot load black to light neutral 2 if your switch is in line with the light and the neutral go from the light back to the breaker box and not to the switch you cant use this the z wave need to stay powered if your neutral line from your light go back to the switch you can use this so if you only have a black wire in to the switch and black wire away from the switch but no neutral wire in the switch you will have to either add a neutral or you cant use it 3 easy to install if you know what your doing i had this installed and up and running in le than 10 minute from receiving the package opening it to having it up and working,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

easy install but big box and bright blue light,4.0,installation is simple if you know how to turn off your circuit breaker and have a screwdriver you can do it yourself one downside to this unit is that behind the face is a large box containing the electronics if you have an older home with small electrical box or if your electrical box is crowded with other outlet and too much extra wiring it can be a bit of a challenge to fit of course you can take this opp if you have an older home with small electrical box or if your electrical box is crowded with other outlet and too much extra wiring it can be a bit of a challenge to fit opportunity to do some organization of the wiring trimming excess etc another downside to this unit is that there is a blue light on the front that is quite bright depending on your installation location and particular use that light may create an unexpected point of focus for something that should be a unobtrusive a a power outlet still this is a good unit and the installation is easy,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

love the zwave product,4.0,love the zwave product instruction is not that clear on how to install the switch after spending 10 minute searching the web for hint and tip found useful information to install the switching and the color coding of the wire after the switch installed i spent the next three day mostly in the evening after work to try to get the switch registered with the smartthings hub not much instruction nor anything on the switch to tell me what is going on would be nice if there is somekind of light a inidicator that it is alive and sending signal or failing sending out signal after trying random thing based on some instruction found on the web manage to get the switch registerd with the controller i still don t know what i did that register it just lucky i guess there are a few more switch that i want to convert over to zwave however due to the hard time configurating this one cause me to pause on the next purchase,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

bright blue led,5.0,i have been using this outlet for a few month now it is hooked into my wink controller so i can control it from my phone from across the city i got this specifically to control a non remote control pedestal fan this outlet plus the fan equaled the cost of a fan that had remote control built in so it wa basically a free controlled outlet there is a blue led in the middle of the outlet that led is lit when the switched outlet is off it is incredibly bright and with the outlet in my bedroom it is too bright thankfully it turn off when the outlet is on so it s almost always off according to the instruction and what i found online the led can be set to work differently always on always off or switched with the outlet sadly that isn t an option on the wink that isn t an issue with the outlet though just in case it isn t clear only one of the outlet is switched the other one is always on,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works good,5.0,i ve installed 5 of these ge z wave light switches 12722 now and they are work great the first 3 took me 1 5 hour to install although it say int the manual that it should take about 15 min but once i figured it out the next set of 2 wa easy i only needed to connect 3 wire 1 hot 1 common and 1 neutral white i have my switch connected to samsung smartthings hub one thing that wa annoying wa that the switch had to be within 10 ft or so of the st hub otherwise it d wouldn t connect but once it s connected they work great i have mine set up so that the little blue light stay on when the light is off it make it easier to find the light switch in the dark the switch doe make a clicking sound when you press it to turn it on off but i barely notice it great product for great price here on amazon,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
good product need fine tuning to become great,4.0,i set up a 3 way the good it s a nice solution the way it power light up and down reminds me of a lutron the bad the thing is massive the control switch requires every type of wire in the box so once you pull them all out good luck getting them back in getting the thing to fit in the box took a much time a wiring it if you have older style box get ready for frustration i have no idea how you would do a 4 gang not a lot of room once you stuff and i mean stuff these giant in the controller switch is too tall the slide switch will lock up once you put a faceplate on because the thing need to be about 1 16 of an inch shorter to move in a standard faceplate cutout so make sure it is set to on because it will never move again the instruction stink i wa all over google and youtube to make sure i wasn t going to mi wire it they ought to direct you to a video specific to the switch because it is not a typical wiring setup besides explaining to the diy installer in basic language what the heck the 4 wire do how the circuit operates in the controller slave setup is just a basic safety item in this case,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
hard to physically hard wire work great after that,4.0,works great with my vera edge hub also look and feel like a real light switch even an expensive real light switch not a cheap or complicated gadget i had to push the button a few time to get it pair but that wasn t a big deal like maybe it took 20 second instead of 10 second then it paired just fine even with the hub across the house they also come with a pigtail wire to help you attached to the neutral which is nice since the neutral is not wired to a regular mechanical switch so if you have a neutral in a wire nut at the back of box you re all set the problem with these is that these are the hardest switch to install i ve ever encountered in term of actually attaching the wire to the screw terminal the screw tend to fall into the housing until they re tightened and they re recessed into the housing in way that make it hard to get the wire around them maybe there s some trick i don t know if i add more i m undecided whether to see if another brand is easier to install or just stick with this brand for consistency and because in the end it doe work,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
the switch easily paired with both a veralite controller a well a,5.0,the switch easily paired with both a veralite controller a well a the wink hub i just purchased we are using several of these to control outdoor light on our porch garage door sidewalk the run on a schedule to come on every night around dark and shut off at 10pm with veralite they work flawlessly and you are even able to change the variable to turn the blue led indicator on when the switch is on and off when the switch is off by default it is the other way around vera also always a dynamic start time in the schedule so you can turn on at sunset or sunset several minute no need to adjust the on time based on the season it doe it for you wink is still having issue correctly reporting the status of generic z wave device such a this one it keep track of the on off of each switch if i am using the wink app to control them however if you use the switch manually heaven forbid or use them in a wink schedule the app just doesn t keep up the good thing about z wave is that on and off are distinct value so if you cycle through your light in the wink app flipping them on and off you can rest assured the app is now is sync with the light hopefully this is something wink address sooner than later where wink doe have an advantage is their native support for geo fencing in addition to a set schedule i have always wanted veralite to turn the outside light on for 15 20 min if my wife and i happen to arrive home late after 10pm when the light are off this is something easily built into a wink robot which us your iphone location to let wink know when you are arriving at or leaving from a set address veralite doe have some third party iphone location add in but have never really got them working all that well,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

great switch if you have a neutral wire,5.0,i have five of the ge z wave plus product and all of them function near perfectly one thing to keep in mind is that all of the in wall connection require a neutral wire to be present do yourself a favor and check your wall box first to see if the wiring is already there other than that it is a simple deal to wire them in and connect them to your z wave hub i use wink 2 ge is one of the few that actually offer an in wall fan controller and it actually work great you get more than just low medium high but the entire 1 100 range i ve taken quite a shine to setting my fan on 1 and it is just enough to keep the air moving without adding a windchill to it,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

these are great,5.0,i searched the internet high and low to find z wave light switch that will work on a 3 way switch meaning two different switch can control the same light for example this wa the only brand i found that would work for me because my house is filled with 3 way switch these are really nice because you can buy the 19 add on slave switch to go with this any way this totally solved my problem and need or should i say want for having my entire house equipped with smart switch now when i go to bed i can just turn off all the light at once from my iphone vivint alarm panel my husband android phone tablet etc another nice perk is that these switch can be added to a vivint sky panel security alarm because it run off z wave then you don t need to buy a hub if connecting to your vivint sky panel just call vivint customer service and they ll give you a temporary code to get into what s called the tool panel and walk you there adding them something else you should know is that these are deep and will be a tight fit when installing them because the back is much deeper than a regular switch not a big deal but just know it will be a tight fit,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
super deal,5.0,fast shipping and a great price adt wanted 109 00 for this exact same switch plus instal installation wa pretty easy but a other reviewer have mentioned you must use all four wire hot common load ground this switch once installed linked up immediately to my adt pulse alarm system this switch is fairly large so in order to fit it into my junction box with 3 other switch i had to remove the side tab no big deal bend them back and forth a couple of time and they come right off easiest to do this before you install the switch into the wall at 41 00 this wa a great deal if you are comfortable working with electricity if not even if you need to hire an electrician the money you save on buying this switch from this seller will offset the money you will pay the electrician make sure if you install this yourself you use a volt meter to determine which of the 2 black wire in your junction box is the hot wire and which is your load wire,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

great product highly recommended,5.0,i purchased 4 of these so far install will depend on your setup mine wa a pain but it had nothing to do with the product just my electrical setup the one thing to pay close attention to is that these require a neutral wire instructions and information on the product page are very clear about this but it took me a few try to figure out why it wasn t working not all of my switch had neutral so i had to improvise a bit once i got past the installation setup wa easy and the work beautifully i m going to buy at least 2 dimmer i thought these were dimmer but that wa my fault they re not took a few time for my wink hub to recognize them during setup but i worked around it and highly recommend these this is a great solution for controlling item that you can t simply replace a bulb for,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works with adt pulse from 15 ft away on different floor,5.0,this is to advertise my stupidity and to save everyone else the same trouble i went through i struggled for 2 day to pair it with adt pulse the mistake i wa making wa i thought the load and line connection were interchangeable in a typical switch that is likely true so didn t pay much attention to what load v line meant so i connected the line to load and vice versa the switch never came on i thought the switch wasn t close enough to the gateway that s why it wasn t pairing note that even without pairing you must be able to get the led on if not then your wiring is off useful info it work with adt pulse a many have already said more importantly you do not need to bring the switch very close to the gateway which can be very difficult to do for this device in my case the switch wa on the first floor and the gateway in the basement about 15 foot away i guess with a couple of wall in between challenges apart from me confusing with the load and line the main challenge are i you need to have a neutral ii the switch doe take a lot of space so fitting them inside the box can be a bit of challenge i installed two together iii breaking the tab away requires some non trivial effort,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works great instructions are clear,5.0,so this switch is used in conjunction with a ge 12727 switch in a 3 way setup once i figured out that this switch existed it wa easy to install it in conjunction with the other ge z wave switch the instruction were very straightforward showing me what a typical 3 way configuration looked like and also the setup with the ge switch you have to be able to identify which switch ha the hot wire and which one just ha the two traveler but if you get it right it work fine for me it worked the first time it s actually better than a normal 3 way switch setup because for both switch up is on and down is off with a typical 3 way switch pair one of them is always on when the switch is down,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
great switch i have it connected with my instance,5.0,great switch i have it connected with my instance of openhab and it work beautifully openhab found the device in no time and setup wa a breeze the only complaint discomfort that i have with this switch is that every time it trigger there s an audible click it s not that big of a deal but if you want absolute silence you might want to look elsewhere another thing that you need to know is that while it s a toggle switch the switch lever never leaf the center you pull it up down to turn on off the light and the lever come back to the center position other than that i absolutely love it and would highly recommend p s word of caution this switch requires neutral white wire you should check that your electrical wire ha 3 wire in it before buying this switch,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
add on ha no night light ge12723 add on compared to linear wt00z add on switch,4.0,the add on switch work fine beware that unlike the ge12722 3way switch or dimmer switch the add on switch doe not have the led light on the bottom so you can find it in the dark i find this very handy and miss this feature note that the linear wt00z add on switch does have the led night light although it is not interchangeable with the ge 12723 in term of wiring the ge 12723 requires a traveler from the master switch the wt00z doe not require a traveler just line and neutral which can be a big advantage if you are adding a remote 3way switch since you do not need wire connecting master and add on to use wt00z with ge switch pair both with smartthings controller then use wt00z with smart lighting app to control the ge or any other switch basically the wt00z can act a a one button scene controller and remotely control a ge switch or whatever group of device you like the wt00z ha radio built in unlike the ge 12723 add on switch which is designed to work specially with the ge 3way or dimmer switch via the traveler wire,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

great switch but watch the face plate screws,4.0,these switch work great before you buy look at the wiring in the box for the switch you are about to replace and make sure that there is a neutral wire in the box this switch will not work without a neutral wire also make sure you know which wire is the load go to the light and which wire is the line always hot and come from the breaker panel use a meter to be sure this switch requires that neutral line and load are all connected to the correct terminal on the switch also if you do not want to use the white cover plate screw that come with the switch you must shorten your current plat crew a others have noted 1 2 star for this i think there is a design flaw in the switch regardless most off the shelf wire stripper have a bolt cutter built into them http www amazon com tools vise grip stripper crimper 2078309 dp b000jnnwq2 ref sr_1_1 s power hand tool ie utf8 qid 1440418485 sr 1 1 keywords wire stripper the other 1 2 star is due to the fact that they only come in white,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
clean install and work great with adt pulse,5.0,i bought 3 of these ge jasco z wave on off switch and all of them work great so far i ran into some wiring challenge with two switch that i wanted to replace so had to ditch self install and call an electrician to get the neutral properly fished out and connected once wired in the switch were instantaneously discovered by the z wave hub i have a netgear router hub that is z wave enabled provided by adt for their pulse security system the ge 45609 switch are in adt s approved list of device and i am able to control the switch using my pulse android app if you have adt pulse with at least one automation device lamp module switch thermostat etc then you don t need to buy another z wave hub and you don t need to pay adt for adding more z wave device to your mesh network i believe adt need to initially enable z wave connectivity in your router account hence the dependency on having at least one automation device you may be able to get z wave activated without purchasing a unit by calling their customer service but i cannot comment on the success rate of that the documentation that come with the switch is not very crisp about how to get it in discovery mode for pairing with the hub i enabled search in the hub and tapped the switch a few time and it did the trick for installation in older gang box you may need to creatively route the existing wire to accommodate the depth of the switch without shorting any contact also if you plan to install more than one in a switch box you will likely need to break off the metal tab on either side of the switch if you rock those tab gently with plier they come off cleanly noticed recently that lowes sell a variant of this switch for their iris platform under the series number 45637 for around 35 while superficial analysis make me think that it is the exact same switch a the 45609 i will need to try one to confirm will post an update when i do so,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

smart home superstar,5.0,this product ge lighting control on off switch z wave in wall works with amazon alexa 12722 work flawlessly with my wink hub 2 and 2nd gen echo dot alexa the only potential downside for anyone with an older house is that a neutral wire is required at the switch box for installation i am not an electrician or contractor but the included instruction provide a clear guide to installation i have installed this switch both a a stand alone and with two of the ge add on switch ge add on switch for z wave zigbee and ge bluetooth wireless lighting controls 12723 in a 4 way switch configuration with no problem whatsoever other than figuring out how my wiring wa run there is a split second delay a the relay is activated but i find this acceptable the small blue led at the botton of the switch light up when the switched light is off and go dark when the switched light is on i believe this behavior can be altered by the user although i have not tried to do so the switch doe not dim it is simply on off for an excellent smart home dimmer switch i definitely recommend the lutron caseta wireless in wall dimmer 600 150 watt single pole works with amazon alexa overall i am thoroughly satisfied with this product and recommend it highly for anyone embarking on a smart home journey,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works exactly a you d hope,5.0,i bought several of these to automate the light for a friend s house we bought her an echo and wink hub at the same time these are a easy to install and setup a any light switch simply unscrew the old one and screw in the new one it s worth noting that the switch itself doesn t move from an up to a down position or vice versa like a traditional switch would the switch stick out at 90 degree to the wall flipping it up turn the light one and down off but once you ve moved the switch a spring return it to the neutral center position like a joystick,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

great remote light control,5.0,after switching my security company to adt for their pulse service i had home automation a part of the package adt supply you with only one indoor appliance plug and the rest of the automation is up to you i had 2 area in the house that i thought could benefit from automation one the lighting switch is not easily accessible and the other wa for a light that we had to remember to turn it on each night and turn it off in the morning it did the trick for both of them the scheduled one more so than the inaccessible one as i had to log in with my user name and password to adt iphone app to turn on and off the light it is not the most convenient thing ever however for the light that need to go on at night and off in the morning it is working great installation wa not the easiest for me i actually thought of returning the package a i thought i could never get it working my old switch had only 2 wire both black one wa the input and the other wa the load the z switch needed also an neutral wire none of my current switch appears to have the ground wire installed after realizing that there is actually a neutral white wire bundle in my switch box a short trip to home depot to be that wire for le than a dollar it worked you need to follow the diagram the black input in my switch box came from a black wire bundle the neutral go to a white wire bundle and the load wa a singe wire not attached to a bundle the difference between this switch and conventional light switch is that this switch is active it need to be powered on by it s own supply whereas the conventional switch are there just to interrupt the circuit or connect it it is bulkier than conventional switch so if you have a crowded box there is a lot of wire to be pushed back all in all we really like it i would have given it 4 5 star not five it doe the trick and doe it well it also work a a z wave repeater making it easier to cover dead spot in your household i already installed 2 of those and debating installing the third,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
this is my go to z wave switch,5.0,i have installed three of these thus far one controlling 7 cfl down light in our eaves one controlling the outdoor outlet for our christmas light led and one that control the light on our back patio incandescent so i can therefore verify that they work well with all three type of bulb if you ve ever installed a light switch before then you find that this switch installs quite easily a long a you have a neutral in your switch box in my experience this ha been a bundle of white wire in the back of the box all connected by a single wire nut so it s pretty easy to use a loose piece of wire to connect the neutral lug on the switch to this bundle the neutral is required because this switch ha a relay in it which is why it will work well with cfl and led light and also why it will make a small click noise when it actuates some review have mentioned the blue led for all three of the installation mentioned above i chose to set the led so that it is on when the switch is on the opposite of the default because i prefer to have an indication of the switch s status and this is more intuitive to me for indoor light you might prefer to leave the default setting making it easier to find the switch in the dark i have had no issue adding these to my controller vera lite but like any z wave device you may have to remove them and re add to get them to work i m sure i ll be adding several more of these to my house,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

good switch but missing a key feature,4.0,these switch work very well so far inclusion to the z wave network ha been easy and consistent for those doing diy like myself raspberry pi 3 with homegenie one important issue with this switch is that it doe not support the association command class this mean that it doe not send a status update to your controller when manually operated by that i mean physically turning a light off or on with the switch rocker it doe send out a nodeinfo frame however so i wa able to work around it with a program instead of constantly polling it other than that they are good switch and will likely buy more of them since the price is reasonable and they seem well made,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
so far so good,5.0,i bought these because they were the only z wave switch i found that actually rock both up and down which to me is intuitive one big surprise is that people all across the internet state that ge jasco switch do not provide instant feedback notification when operated manually i can tell you that is false i have 1 jasco and 3 ge branded unit and all send notice to my phone the instant the relay kick in the light and yes i m taking about when i press the button on the switch i use girder 6 from promixis with an aeon labs z stick to run my network and i do have polling set to one minute however i can stand there and flip the switch on and off and see every single change which is not possible with polling you can also reverse the way the status led work on them to have it come on when the switch is on if you want if they hold up and continue to work like they do now i ll be extremely happy with them the only thing i didn t like wa the size of the internal housing and the recessed screw terminal but i managed to get them in the box make sure you have a neutral wire to hook them up,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

easy compatibility with front point security,5.0,once the system saw the switch it started functioning perfectly being able to turn table lamp on and off remotely is good but i ve always thought that anyone casing the neighborhood would more likely think there really might be someone at home if ceiling light could join in this switch accomplishes that if you are at all handy around the house you should be able to install this switch yourself be prepared to wrestle the wire a bit because like most fancy function switch this thing bulk large in the switch box it take some maneuvering and a little bit of muscle to get the wire in and then have the face plate set level with the wall there are two ongoing feature of this switch that you should know about one is that it ha a blue led monitor light i can t remember what the function of it is but it stay on all night it shed very very little light but it doe give out some and you have to live with that the other thing that take a little getting used to is that it switch the current electronically so it doesn t have the usual snick when you push it on or off when you press the switch what s happening is that you are actually pressing a micro switch that signal the electronics to switch the current there s nothing wrong with that but every time i press the switch i still notice that it doesn t feel or sound the same a the other switch in my house i m thinking i ll get another one or two of these but maybe that s just the geek in me that think it s neat that i can turn on the light from a couple of thousand mile away,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
first of many to be installed into my house,5.0,after a month s use it ha worked flawlessly easy to install even came with the extra ground wire that i didn t notice until i had already installed with my own wire stash i have in a 3 gang box and it look a little different from the other original but only i notice that the other two will be in the expected off or on position and this of course stay in a neutral position no complaint here just completing the review i will purchase more a i move from room to room,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works good with aeon labs z stick,5.0,i m not an electrician but i am not a stranger to installing light switch everything worked good but some thing to keep in mind 1st of all this thing go pretty deep into the electrical box so deep that if i want to add anymore to my home i will be forced to switch out the original metal box that s there now where i installed this switch the in wall box wa already switched to a plastic one when we remodeled the house so i had no issue there the fact i have i m going to have to switch out the in wall metal box to deeper plastic one if i want to add more of these to my home isn t the fault of the switch it s just the time period of when the house wa built so i won t lower my rating of this product because of it like the other reviewer have said you need to make yourself a little negative white jumper from the switch to the bundled negative wire and wire nut them all together to make this switch work normally this doesn t need to be done with regular switch where you would just bundle all the negative wire together and wire nut them also you have to split up the main power and the power going to the light on the switch a well once i read the direction and had to turn the power off and on several time to find which wire wa main power it wa easy i had someone helping me so i wouldn t have to keep running back to the electrical box one more thing to add is the screw themselves on this switch were extremely hard to break free almost feel like they are glued in place for some reason lol once i broke them free it wa easy but man get ready to use some muscle to break them free also other reviewer have added that when you put the wire in the back of the switch that these are not the push type you must push the wire into place and screw down the corresponding screw to securely lock the wire into place other version of normal switch allow you to just push the wire in and it will hold this is not the case with this light switch once setup the switch button take some getting used to but once you get used to it it not bad they don t actually toggle up or down like a normal switch its more like a push button setting up with z wave wa easy using aeon dsa02203 zwus labs z wave z stick series 2 usb dongle a my controller put the z stick into add mode the direction for the switch to add the zwave switch to a controller is press on or off on the switch with the z wave controller in add mode the z stick added the device right away with no issue using the aeon labs z wave z stick and incontrol home automation software for my setup with no issue even with all it minor problem it still function perfectly and will buy more soon update 8 12 13 purchased another for the kitchen and work perfectly a the 1st one doe no issue controlling remotely and breeze to setup,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
my favorite z wave on off wall switch,5.0,my favorite z wave on off wall switch i like them for a few reason first they seem more solid than competing switch second i like the way they get wired in rather than rat tail wire that you connect to the romex in the j box these have little hole like outlet do that you insert the romex wire into seems more secure and take up le room in the box third and most importantly they are instant status with homeseer which isn t the case for competing switch from linear the led is blue which is cool but for the fact that all other manufacturer use green leds so be careful mixing these with other manufacturer in the same j box if you want a consistent look,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
make sure you have a white nutral wire,3.0,i bought 3 of these unit to control the light in my kitchen replacing the switch that controlled the light above my kitchen island and the bank of light 3 spot above my cabinet had no problem and work well these switch require a nutral white wire be connected so that the switch can be powered on continously when i tried to replace the switch that controlled the bank of light above my counter the original switch just had the black power wire with no white common wire in the box and the smart switch wouldn t work i tried running the white common wire from an adjacent power plug but that didn t work either maybe the issue wa because all of this wiring wa behind a gfi so the lesson here is before ordering this item inspect the wiring of where you plan on installing this switch to insure that a white common wire is present in my situation all my kitchen light are now controlled by alexa except for this one bank of light which is still manual,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
great switch with toggle works without controller,5.0,works great toggle stay in the middle a little different but get the job done well without having to replace all the cover i prefer the way it look over the decora switch paired perfectly with my veraplus controller and add on switch to make it a three way wires completely different than a regular three way switch so pay attention had both old switch replaced paired and working in about 30 minute the best thing about these is they work with or without your controller being online mine fit in a standard plastic box that wa original to a 1990 home does make an electronic switching noise when activated not a biggie to me will buy more without hesitation,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

good zwave switch and easy to install,5.0,i ve used many of these and i like this one for the price it seems to be a well made a any other zwave switch i have used and is cheaper than all of them this device requires power in the box to power the control and a switch leg to switch so basically you need a neutral hot and switch in the box i like the blue led that let you know where the switch is in the dark it is not too bright and not too soft when you first get these screw the screw in slightly they will feel tight like they are already screwed down but they are screwed all the way out so screw them in slightly maybe a quarter turn before hooking up be careful a this type of connector can be easily stripped that would be my only complaint but the ge are like that too update i said in my earlier review that the switch wa cheaper than the ge but now that lowes sell ge the ge is much cheaper these unit are still working fine but for almost 8 dollar a piece cheaper elsewhere i ve changed brand they are still working great though,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
easy to install if you have a neutral wire,5.0,once i figured out where to tap into the neutral wire this wa a simple installation i probably spent more time turning the breaker on and off than actually putting the switch in place i paired this with my adt pulse system which i also have linked to my echo alexa app so not only can i schedule my light with my security system but we can ask alexa to turn off the light instead of arguing who got into bed last without shutting off the light,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works fantastic with adt pulse,5.0,got two of these to integrate into my new adt pulse system it took me a second to realize that i needed to wire up the included wire to the neutral line normal light switch don t switch the neutral on and off so it s just sitting bundled up in the back of the box behind the existing switch i wired up the switch to an existing light switch near the antenna z wave base then logged into pulse and matched it up then moved the switch to the final location and did a refresh on the z wave system works great scheduling and automation are fantastic i have my porch light turn on when it get dark and turn of at 1am and i have my garage light turn on when i open the garage door and turn of automatically 10 minute later so someone doesn t forget and being able to check on the alarm system and the light from my phone is always a fantastic feature,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
game changer,5.0,i bought the plug and two toggle switch both worked seamlessly through set up with my wink hub super easy to add this product and configure it i did hire an electrician to install all three but i m sure it s easy to install on your own no more turning around to drive back home when i think i ve left my flatiron on,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
great product but connecting to hub required it be within 10 foot of it,4.0,this light switch work great installation wa a slight issue for me based on the fact that my box wa a tight fit probably due to the age of my home built 40 year ago and the standard size used then it work a a switch on it own a well a being remotely controlled the only issue i had wa getting it connected to my wink hub the switch installation instruction indicated that if you have problem to make sure the hub is within 10 foot of the light switch which wa my case so i had to move the wink from room to room to get the switch on it,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works great with wink no faceplate swapout required,5.0,i got this to use with wink i like it because i didn t have to change out the faceplate the dimension of the switch lever are completely compatible with mechanical switch you do need to provide a hot lead to keep this thing powered at all time that mean 3 connection plus ground instead of two a with mechanical switch that mean some wiring work when installing be sure you know what you re doing and how to do it safely or else let someone with the proper skill do it,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

amazing product but be aware that these require a neutral wire,5.0,works perfectly i have three of these connected to a smartthings home automation network they work perfectly and integrate with smartthings immediately that said please note that you must have a neutral wire running to these unit for them to operate that is typically the white wire that are grouped all together and stuffed in the back of the electrical box my switch did not previously use a neutral wire so getting this working meant that i needed to dig out those wire and add an additional white wire from the unit to the group of neutral wire so you may need to do a little more setup than expected though it is nothing overly complex,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

just missed a 5 star,4.0,i use this with a piper security system a the controller it wa hard to pair with the piper but that seems to be true of every z wave device used with piper switch piper and wireless router all need to be in the same room to get piper to recognize the switch tough to do tip pulsing the switch on and off seemed to help piper find the switch one button push didn t work for me i think it is not the ge switch s fault anyway now that it is paired it all work perfectly the switch control our porch light and is set to turn on and off at time i can set via the piper app if i don t have my phone handy i can turn the light on and of with the mechanical switch one more thing the screw that hold the bare ac wire in the switch are somewhat tricky to use it took several try to get one of the wire to be firmly secured in the switch terminal without that hiccup and the pairing difficulty i would have given it a 5 star a i am happy with how it is working now,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works exactly as expected plus a tech tip for you,5.0,used this to control the low voltage landscape lighting transformer malibu type stuff it wa learned into a 2gig system in a manner of second with no issue tech tip the key to a stress free learn process is very simple before you learn any new z wave device into the network you must first delete it it doe not matter if the product is brand new or used doing this will eliminate any potential problem the second tip is to make sure and have a load plugged into the controlled outlet if you use a lamp make sure there is a light bulb in it pretty much any non motor appliance device will work no vacuum cleaner many z wave 110v device require this to delete or learn the item in work properly every control system is different but trust me take the extra couple of second to do these thing and you will have smooth sailing you can thank me later cheers,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

excellent product work great with smartthings not simple to install,4.0,i recently purchased and installed two of these smart switch for my smartthings home automation system to control a porch ceiling light and an entry hall ceiling light one is dimmable and i installed it a a 3 way switch using the ge 12728 z wave wireless lighting control add on switch and the other is a simple non dimmable off on smart switch despite some significant challenge in getting the 3 way set up installed properly it is all working perfectly and i am very pleased i would definitely buy more in fact i probably will a i further develop my home automation integration with smartthings v 2 hub went flawlessly i like especially that via smartthings smartlighting app i can easily set the dimmer level e g to 30 when the light come on as mentioned my only real problem wa to figure out how to wire the 3 way switch set up correctly i did finally get it working correctly at one point i figured i would have to break down and call an electrician but pushed thru and figured it out but it took a long time and a good bit of trial and error the instruction are accurate but for me in any case i had to carefully read them over and over and go step by step i did find a great youtube video tutorial that wa excellent and got me on the right track http www youtube com watch v fx1lue9llsq what i discovered to be the cause of my trouble with the wiring besides the fact that i m not an electrician wa that the 3 way switch i wa replacing had been wired in a non standard way it ended up to be critical for me to figure out which switch i wa replacing wa the line or primary switch and which wa the load or add on switch once i had that then both the youtube video tutorial and the manual made good sense oh well along the way i feel like i earned an amateur electrician certification and saved a bundle by not having to bring in an electrician but for the feint of heart and if your home wiring is a bit complex you might just want to pay to have someone else do it this difficulty with the installation is the only reason i didn t give this a 5 star review,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

professional good looking lighting control for home automation system,5.0,it s a bit tricky to install particularly into a switch box with other switch in a single gang box it would be very easy in a multi gang box you will definitely need to break off the tab on the edge they are designed to do this when necessary the terminal screw don t loosen very far so getting the wire looped around them take patience and a little bit of brute force probably a good idea to have some form of external lighting available battery powered on an extension cable to a different circuit since you will have turned off the breaker to this circuit and will likely have killed other form of nearby lighting in the process once installed it program readily into the z wave controller console and doe exactly what you expect it to do i m very pleased with it it blend precisely with the other light switch in the box and doesn t look odd in any way,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

high quality receptacle physical configuration could be more flexible,4.0,i have purchased and installed three of these so far i have been impressed with the build quality and operation i would comment that the z wave range seems to be more limited than an external plug in module especially when mounted in a metal electrical box if you are planning to use this to automate a night light be aware that most night light on the market are designed to plug into the top outlet leaving the bottom outlet free on this unit the bottom outlet is controlled by z wave and the top outlet is an ac pas through since most night light are also polarized it is not possible to plug the night light into the bottom outlet upside down to avoid blocking the top outlet and the push button so you end up plugging it right side up into the bottom outlet which essentially block the top outlet and the push button,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works a intended with some significant shortcoming,3.0,i bought 3 switch that i connected to an openhab with z stick these are my impression one of the 3 switch wa doa but amazon rushed a replacement the next day prop to them for the responsiveness the switch have a very short reception range i experimented and found significant drop at 30 foot this wa true of all 3 the switch don t report to the master node when the state change so i had to set up a refresh polling every 60 second this may be a deal breaker if you own any battery powered z wave device in your network overall these device do what they promise with the limitation i mentioned i wouldn t get any more ge switch until they improve their software and range,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

these are the only toggle style smart switch i could find,4.0,these are the only toggle style smart switch i could find i like it because it allowed for me to add some smart switch without changing my entire home s switch to paddle style which would have been very costly users should be cautioned that since these are smart switch they require constant power and therefore need a neutral wire inspect your current gangbox and switch and verify you have a neutral available to run a jumper to before ordering these switch my only complaint with these switch is that i wish there wa a more positive feel to the switch itself when manually turning it on and off,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

super easy,5.0,i had this installed in 10 minute simply took the black wire hot off old switch and placed it on new terminal marked for it the othe black wire going to the light i put on the load terminal marked a well and i added a pigtail to the existing white wire aka common to the zwave marked common this also had the traveler terminal but wa taped over to be removed only if using a a 3 way switch mine wa not simply a switch in one place only you must install the white wire a the unit need power of it own to work i have done alot of my own wiring and i have an old house so i often would feed the switch after the the light rather than through the switch box which is great but in that case you would not have a white wire to use a a common i refer to this a a switch leg not sure what electrician call it i enrolled or learned it in to a lynx touch l5100 alarm system with a zwave module saw it once i activated it i edited it name description and all is done i will be controlling this via smart phone and or ipad app total connect 2 in the automation tab i have a very large garage 50 foot detached and i put this switch out there so some light would be on when i pulled in or anytime i wanted without going out to do it so this unit is seen or linked in an exterior building i wa concerned a it isnt far but with wall and such it work perfect this zwave technology will get easier and le expensive i think of it a a new hobby i went from a 50 cent switch to 40 00 haha enjoy hope this review wa helpful a the one i read before i bought were helpful to me,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

quality switch but not a super strong hub connection,4.0,this thing is really great and is the next best thing to wifi connected bulb themselves unfortunately it loses connection to the smartthings hub frequently enough to be quite annoying but i don t feel that i can fully blame the switch a the hub is located in a cabinet behind a wall and next to lot of electrical equipment it doe feel very high quality and for the physical switch itself it s solid and is like any old dimmer,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
regardless of the instruction connect the neutral,4.0,works great my one complaint would be that the instruction say to connect the neutral when required as far a i can tell it s always required i returned the first one thinking it didn t work since the wiring diagram doesn t even show it it is not powered by trickle current other than that it doe what it s advertised to do kind of large for your typical box but not out of spec or anything just bulky,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

i gave it 4 star because it wa more complicated,4.0,i gave it 4 star because it wa more complicated wiring them up 4 way and the instruction were not very clear i finally figured it out and once you understand what is going on with these switch it make sense forget about what you already know about your typical 3 way and 4 way switch wiring in my situation i wanted to replace 3 switch that controlled our stairway light so i purchased one 12722 on off switch and two 12723 add on switch think of the 1272 a the master switch because it is basically doing all the work the add on switch just send a signal down one of the traveler wire to the master switch to tell it to turn on or off the master switch ha 4 connections when you look at the back of the switch they are e top left load power out to the light f top right traveler this is where the add on switch are connected to c lower left line power in from the breaker b neutral neutral the add on switch only have two connection dd top traveler wire back to the master switch bb bot neutral so once you figure out your line in and load out it is fairly simple to wire up in my situation i had 3 location left middle right power came into the box on the left line and power went out to the light from the box on the right load i wanted to put the master switch in the box on the right ge recommends to put it in the middle if you can but my middle box wa crammed full of wire and i didn t want to deal with it the three box are connected with each other with 3 wire red black and white since my power wa coming in to the box on the left and i wanted it to go to the box on the right i jumpered the two black wire togethor in both the left and middle box that way line wa passed directly to the box on the right the two add on switch were going in to the box on the left and the middle box they each take two wire a neutral and a traveler wire note they can use the same traveler wire so in the box on the left i had a red wire which i connected to the add on the switch in the middle box i connected the two red wire together with a wire nut and added a jumper to connect to that add on switch and in the box on the right i connected the red traveler wire to the traveler connection on the master switch again the add on box can use the same traveler wire since they only send a control signal down that wire to the master switch when you turn one of the add on box off or on edit to add i have an older z wave network that us mostly intermatic devices that i bought from amazon in 2008 i am also using think essentials software from control think out of business now that run on my home server a the primary controller i am happy to report that i wa able to easily add this newer switch to my existing z wave network work great,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
good so far and a fairly decent value,4.0,i installed two of these last week so far they work great perhaps i could grouse about the price but considering that an outlet with usb charging port run about 21 the 37 for this z wave switch isn t too much of a stretch what i would ve liked for the price is for it to come with wire nut or two like the cooper wiring dimmer switch did although that wa 56 a short stretch of bare copper wire for the ground would ve been nice too there is a delay when tapping the switch i d guess 200 300 millisecond it s not too bad what i really like about these smart switch is that when configured multi way the switch position don t get out of sync in a 3 way configuration having both switch on while the light is off get on my nerve other folk with ocd can relate i m sure adding the node to my network using an aeon labs z stick gen5 wa painless,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
work fine but ground screw is in a ridiculous location,3.0,this switch work a advertised i use it with tube smartthings 2 hub however the designer located the ground screw on the top of the thing s body this mean that you need to remove the ground screw in order to get it to fit in some plastic box the heavy duty gray one in particular thus creating a safety hazard and code violation this wa simply a poor design choice a there is no functional reason fir such a location if they d located the ground screw on the side of the body this would be a non issue,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
series 300 z wave not series 500 if you can wait for the new model i suggest waiting,4.0,approximately two year ago zwave came up with a new standard it is called series 5 series 500 zwave plus it is a major improvement over series 300 product that being said this is one of my favorite wave 300 light switch it work great for for a series 300 product one thing that none of the other manufacturer mention is that all switch except of this one and the homeseer switch don t update the controller instantly about that status of the switch being on or off this one update instantly this can be very convenient for example if you want to open your garage door or turn on other light when you manually turn this light switch on the problem with the homeseer switch is this feature on updating the controller instantly is claimed to currently only work with the homeseer controller some people are working on some plugins for the vera to work with the homeseer switch but i haven t been able to confirm if they got it working or not ge ha announced a series 500 version of this switch they even have the manual online unfortunately it isn t currently available anywhere that i could find unlike other ge jasco product there is no link on their web page to purchase it i suspect the new model will be out very very soon series 500 is night and day better than series 300 it take away a lot of the aggravation of series 300 if you can wait a little longer for the new model i would overall i like the quality of this switch it work great with vera plus i like how they made the blue led smaller than the previous model fyi ge jasco are the same company product they just use different name depending upon whether they are selling to consumer or contractor,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works well,5.0,i needed product with zwave according to my security company i found some porch light and bulb with zwave but they were expensive so i thought why not just get a switch because it s not like i only need to turn one light on at a time anyway so i found this on amazon and it work like a charm for a fraction of the price of the light bulb this paired with our security system quickly and easily we had a decorative double switch wall plate and this switch fit perfectly in the old switch place so i wa still able to keep my existing plate,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works like a charm,5.0,i already have somewhat of a z wave system in the house through verizon my front porch light stopped working and no not just the bulb a few month ago so i troubleshooted a few thing i figured since i had to replace the porch light i might a well replace the switch inside i didn t have to but i figured it would be nice to have the light programmed to turn on at certain time can t do that with a flip switch installation wa easy no problem whatsoever i will say that it s a lot bigger than an actual switch so make sure you have room in your junction box now come the tricky part for z wave wait no tricky part my system picked it up automatically the blue indicator light is great to have to make sure it s on when it s supposed to be,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works great but one thing to think about the,4.0,works great but one thing to think about the switch itself is really big compared to what it is replacing and getting it back in the electrical box may be a challenge depending on how well your electrician set up the box with wire in the first place in a standard box it barely fit then if the wiring is not terminated well in the box it s a tough fit if you have a 2 or 3 plate with other switch good luck getting one of these in there with all the other wiring i had bought 3 1 for a single plate and 2 for a 3 plate that control 2 set of outside light the single wa a tight fit and the 3 plate i could only install 1 of these switch because i had to move all of the wiring out from behind this one switch and put it behind the other 2 and that left no room for the other wave switch the hardest part of installing this wa jamming it back in the electrical box and getting the short screw to secure it down i had to find 2 longer screw to even reach the screw hole in the electrical box once in it work great but finding it took a little playing around too i had the blue light on and i selected find thing it spun for 30 minute and found nothing then i reset everything and tried again nothing tried again and this time when it wa searching i went over and toggled the switch a few time turning the light on and off and it found it instantly not sure if this is part of the instruction but i ve connected lot of thing and only these switch required me to toggle the switch for it to be found,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
and then linked them to my smart home system,5.0,i installed these in several room that my kid frequent and forget to turn light off in and then linked them to my smart home system each of these room is now controlled by a motion detector so that the light turn off automatically after a certain amount of time when no motion is detected installation wasn t difficult but you have to make sure you have a full circuit hot and neutral in the switchbox that you plan on installing this device in not all residential box are wired this way,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
good product,3.0,great concept work well with my z wave controller and smarphone app however it doe not have the blue led like the primary switch when you install it in a 2 3 4 gang box and 1 or more of the others are a primary with the blue led it look like something is wrong with it because there is no blue light to expand the blue light is on when the actual light is off this help you find it in the dark so naturally you start to recognize that a switch without a blue light mean the light is on when you walk by a 3 4 gang box and want to turn a light on you tend to look past the switch without a blue light because you subconsciously assume it must be on i end up hitting multiple switch trying to get the right one and the overall impression a visitor get when they see the one switch with no light is that it must be burned out its inconsistent please add a blue light to all of them,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

fantastic product but can take forever to install if you are not electrically savy,5.0,i have this product installed and synced to my nexia home intelligence system put the first one on my front house light and used nexia to automate the turn off at sunrise and on at sunset to sync i simply pressed the plus button on my nexia gateway pressed the up on this zwave switch and waited for light to go back to solid worked first time now the install holy cow did i spend a ton of time on this mainly because of my own ineptitude when it come to electrical circuitry hopefully you can benefit from my folly first off this switch requires a neutral wire old home may not have this if you don t look at other answered question to understand how to install or other option fyi the neutral wire is most often the white wire in your switch box in mine there were four neutral wire tied together via wire nut the easiest way is to buy some 10 gauge romex and just run another wire from the switch to this wire nut i of course didn t do it this way cut one of the wire to short had to splice up in the wall blah blah i hate wire second if you have everything plugged in and you have cussed at the switch for not working try switching the load and hot wire the two black wire third you must have a proper ground wire in my box there were extra ground wire tied together so i just grabbed one and it worked most importantly even a tempting a it may be not to always walk back to your fuse box and turn it off between attempt,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

does what it say,4.0,purchased 3 of these switch to interface with my vivint home security system vivint s central panel ha a built in z wave controller now i can automatically turn on or off certain light a i arm or disarm the system i can even control how long the light stay on for example whenever i disarm the system my front exterior light turn on a well a some interior light as stated in other review this switch requires 4 wire a load line ground and a neutral in modern home more often than not the neutral wire will be passing through the box the switch is in looks for a bunch of white wire that are tied together with a wire nut remove the wirenut and add a pigtail to the bunch this will be you neutral for your switch replace the wirenut you may have to go with a larger size nut older home may not be compatible generally if your house ha three prong receptacle you should be ok the weak point of the switch are the terminal they can be easily stripped out some people feel more comfortable wrapping the wire around the terminal rather than using the clamping system these are not like the spring clip you find on standard switch you must insure that the wire is on the correct side of the clamping nut when you tighten down the screw otherwise the wire will fall back out,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

tldr buy ge instead of linear,5.0,my only complaint is that the tab that you are supposed to break off do not come off easily i tried various plier and cutter and ended up just using my dremel to make the pre cut cut deeper so that i could use plier depending on how good drunk you are with a dremel this can be a quick task or a longer one anyways i wa installing quite a few of these so once i had my system down it wa pretty easy but you just need to make sure you plan ahead and know where each switch will be and take off the edge before you install them if you re comparing these to the linears those tab come off really easy with plier so for the actual switch i will be comparing the ge 12722 12723 combo directly with the linear ws15z 1 wt00z 1 combo quick bit of knowledge i am not an electrician so some of this is probably obvious and possibly incorrect a 3 way setup involves two switch with a traveler going between the two a 4 way setup involves 3 or more switch with the 4 way terminology being that one switch in the setup ha two in and two out this switch is connected to two switch instead of just one so first off is price and price being the price a of writing this the 12722 is 40 the accessory switch 12723 are 20 for linear the main switch is 29 and the accessory switch are 34 50 in a 3 way setup ge would cost you 60 and the linear would cost you 63 50 in a 4 way setup with 3 switch ge would cost you 80 and linear would cost you 98 i made the mistake of reading the old review for the ge 45xxx switch which were rated pretty unfavorably so i initially went with linear and now i have a frankenstein combination of ge jasco and linear switch the linears will only save you money if you are replacing individual switch that are not in a multi switch set up the ges can do a true 3 way 4 way multi way setup meaning that if an emp wipe out your server and your z wave network dy you can still turn off the light to your dungeon from the switch on the false wall in the kitchen the linears are a virtual multi switch and do not have the ability to incorporate a traveler wire the ability to control one light from the other ha nothing to do with with the wiring the control of both device is dependent on your z wave controller as far a i know ge doesn t have a native virtual switch however at least in homeseer i can have the linear wt00z control any device on my network so if i did need to add a remote switch to control my ge light i could use one of those to do so color the switch in my house were standard white i believe they were levitons no idea if this is just the type of white i had for my switch but the ges match perfectly whereas the linears are a slightly different shade of white it s not really noticeable but when you have one linear between two ges you can tell if you look at them close enough leds ge blue linear green up to you installation ge hand down win here the ge switch use punch in terminal and the linears require wire nut the problem with wire nut is that it add more bulk to your gang box and i probably would have punched a hole in my wall before managing to cram three linears into a 3 way box the ges just use the existing wire save for a wire nut required for the neutral which you should just be able to take off from the existing bundle of neutral wire and add it to them reusing the wire nut that s already there as mentioned above it is way easier to remove the metal tab from the linears than it is for the ges on that note however the metal on the linears is much thinner than that of the ges the ges feel a robust a the mechanical switch i took out of the wall the linears feel cheap and the metal can bend if you re not careful all said and done both product work well but if i wa purchasing again i would have just done all ge the linears that i bought mostly went into single gang box so that i could use the wall plate they come with in order to have the color match i m hesitant to give much in the way of installation tip a i am far from a professional but if you re wondering what to do with the original line and load wire in a 3 way set up i wa told to tie them together with a wire nut since they re not being used in a 4 way set up you need find the 4 way device and wire nut the two traveler with a pig tail that will then plug into the accessory switch know that there are numerous method for multi switch setup and ge doesn t use any of them so you need to understand how your set up work in order to incorporate the ges i highly recommend getting a non contact voltage tester a wire tracer tone generator and if you live in a house built more than a few year ago make sure you have neutral wire hidding behind the wall switch so you don t waste your time,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
good design,4.0,i m just starting to set up a z wave network and this is the first remote switch i purchased controlling an outdoor porch light switches i ve bought in the past came with wiring already attached and stripped and ready to install out of the box this one doe not and so installation doesn t go a quickly a it could keep in mind this switch continually draw power to operate it electronics and so it requires a neutral wire also like a lot of fancy in wall switch it take up a lot of room in your electrical box i like how there are various option you can configure even for a basic on off switch like this you can reverse the operation of the switch and configure the behavior of the blue indicator led one negative point is there is noticeable delay of a quarter of a second or so from the time you push the switch to the time the light turn on or off it would be nice if it wa more immediate so it would feel more like a mechanical switch i don t know if this is typical of these remote switch or not also i wish the manufacturer would document the power draw of the switch while it s in a standby state,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works great once installed but there are a couple of major concern,3.0,once the switch is installed it work great with smartthings alexa i like how it provides space for two wire on each screw it s responsive intuitive no regret here are a couple of major thing to look out for though 1 there s a major flaw in the design where the switch will play dead if you use the screw from your old wallplate the screw is too long and will short out the inside which made me think the switch wa defective for a minute i will have to modify my screw because the manual doesn t state where to get compatible one 1 star 2 there is another switch underneath the toggle which can also turn the light on off i don t really know why this is needed but a normal wallplate interferes with it i will have to modify my plate again the manual doesn t state where to get a compatible plate 1 star 3 the gut of the switch are huge it s pretty much 80 of the size of my old gang box i had to get a deeper box to accommodate the switch with the wiring this cost me a dollar and a lot of effort this won t hurt the score because it s not the switch s fault and ymmv,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

good value weak documentation,4.0,so i m not an electrician by any mean but i thought the documentation wa a bit lacking the difficulty i had getting this going wa related to the fact that the old switch didn t utilize the neutral wire whereas this requires it not a big deal but it left me scratching my head once the neutral wire wa connected everything worked just fine there wa a little issue connecting one of them to vera but after a vera reset it worked just fine the product feel cheaply made i would have given this 3 start if it weren t for the price but at 50 i think it wa a pretty darn good value if i wanted super high quality i could have paid twice a much and bought a leviton switch i will likely buy several more of these for switch where i don t need immediate status feedback to vera vera must poll this device to get it s status,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works fine but some flaw,3.0,this is a great device the quality seems very good installation is very quick and easy just like swapping out an outlet there are a couple thing you should know though first is that this only ha a single connection meaning you will lose functionality if you replace an outlet that is also switch some outlet have the bottom outlet always on and the top outlet is operated with a wall switch this isn t a flaw and it isn t implied anywhere that it would work for that application but i wish i would have realized that before i installed it i didn t lower my rating because of that installation is easy but functionality is not the direction are essentially install it the turn on your z wave device and pair it there is no direction to indicate how to put the device in pairing mode also i have a vivint system and they need a serial number which isn t available when it is installed additionally the instruction say that in some installation initial set up must be done within ten foot of the controller a big flaw for an outlet that could go anywhere in your house mine luckily wa within that distance so i didn t get the chance to test the ten foot distance issue once i got it set up with vivint it work flawlessly and look great my biggest complaint is the blue light that cant shut itself off it is always on when the z wave enabled signal ha shut the power off so either the outlet is on and the blue light is off or the outlet is off and the blue light is on more and more device are doing this which is not needed and add no functionality granted a small led doesn t use much power but it is ironic that a device that is marketed a a way to conserve electricity ha a light that you can t shut off and it is definitely bright enough that in a bedroom it would be very bothersome had i known that ahead of time i would not have bought this and will not but another edit to add faceplate information it is true there is no faceplate because there is no way to know which faceplate to include in the package this could be installed a a single outlet in a double outlet etc or a single outlet and a cable outlet the possibility are endless so it doesn t make sense to include an outlet cover no other outlet come with cover for this same reason however that isn t really common knowledge and most people assume that the outlet and the cover are the same product like a bottle and a lid so while ge doesn t imply this come with a faceplate and i don t think they are under any obligation to say that this doesn t come with a faceplate because that is the industry standard it would make people happier with the product because they wouldn t be expecting a faceplate and then have to run to the local hardware store and buy a faceplate the faceplate from the old outlet almost certainly won t work,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works great i bought this to integrate with my vera,4.0,works great i bought this to integrate with my vera edge veraedge home controller now if i could just get alexa to work with it i would swap out all my light switch its kinda big so if you have a bunch of wire in the box it will be difficult to fit in there,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

ditto what others have said,4.0,i installed two of these switch in the same box over this past weekend and will echo most of what ha been said previously with a couple of warning which is why it s only 4 star 1 with the little metal tab on either side of the switch it is tight further it wa basically impossible for me to break them off i hesitated resorting to a hack saw so left the tab in place hence why it wa such a tight fit in the box 2 a neutral wire is a must lucky i had neutral wire bundled in the box that were unused however simply taking one of those and plugging it into the neutral location wa not effective i needed to purchase another length of wire all of 3 5 inch and join that to the already existing neutral wire bundle in the box and connect the new wire to the switch basically kep the neutral wire bundled and run a wire off of them for the switch 3 i used the push in wire location rather than wrapping the wire around the post this wa easy and the post tightened down to clamp the wire in place except for one neutral it just would not budge i actually exchanged it and the new one worked just fine 4 did i mention putting two together in a box is tight 5 once these were in place they each paired with my vera3 in about 10 second no fuss no mus no hassle i had them set in automated scene within a couple of minute and working perfectly 6 the documentation provided doe not cover any of this the documentation is the one downfall on this product rely upon the internet review and others comment they are very helpful i would clearly recommend using these switch and plan to add several more to the house in the future now that i know the trick,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

a basic on off switch you can control with z wave,4.0,i have a number of wall switch i wanted to sense and control from my z wave vera 3 system and the jasco seemed like one of the better option like most of the other switch of this type you need a white neutral wire running to the box in order to install the switch properly my understanding is that this is how the internal z wave radio is powered still if you don t have the neutral feed in your junction box it would take some creative wiring and maybe a professional electrician to install one of these if you have any doubt there are some good youtube installation video that help a lot i wa able to pair with my z wave controller at a distance of about 30 foot with no trouble just did a full power pairing and the device wa found with no trouble at all once installed this type of z wave switch act like a range extender to your z wave network so for the price of running an extra transmitter you get generally better communication every time you install another switch my only complaint about these switch is that the feel is a bit cheap instead of a nice solid thump when you switch it on and off it doe feel a bit flimsy otherwise they absolutely work perfectly were easy to pair with my system and even have a pleasant blue led to make finding the switch easy in a dark room or to tell at a glance whether the switch is on or not otherwise these switch function flawlessly and i have no reservation about using them in my home automation system definitely recommended,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

does not work with led low wattage bulb,3.0,well this review is together with leviton vri06 1lz vizia rf i tried both and after many hour of testing and reading and back and forth i finally figured that these will not work with low wattage led light bulb i don t think these are bad product but some how they didn t recognize the current flowing through the bulb they are made for regular bulb or maybe higher wattage led bulb the bulb that i used were 2 bulb each at 3 watt and it failed to recognize them so i assume that the minimum wattage ha to be 13 watt although i never tested that so since we are all going to use led soon i would suggest that the manufacture need to take into consideration how to manage the product that can be compatible with them i hope it help and save some time for other people,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

switch work very well,4.0,completely disagree with the other reviewer granted this could have been more clearly labeled and explained which is why i m only giving 4 star but it doe say auxiliary in the product title this switch sku 12728 is meant for circuit where you have more than one switch example a foyer light that ha three switch one of these three switch need to be the main unit sku 12727 and the two others are auxiliary this 12728 if your circuit only ha a single switch that single switch must be the main unit 12727 not the auxiliary unit it is not a good idea to mix z wave with non z wave dumb switch on the same circuit it s the main switch 12727 not the auxiliary 12728 that pair with the z wave network and that get programmed i have three of these circuit in my house all professionally installed and they work like a charm can be programmed into scene can be monitored and turned on off with my smartphone and can be tied to event one of these circuit is illuminating the view for security camera yes they integrate very well into adt pulse,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

a good switch but not great and certainly not awesome,3.0,this is a good switch but it not deserving of four or five star here s why 1 it is very deep i had to go get an old work box just so that the existing wiring could fit changing that box out took me hour 2 it doe not allow reversing the hot line wire plenty of other smart switch allow it guess they detect it somehow this one doesn t 3 it required me to run my white wire neutral into the box but never clearly stated it while it seems obvious to anyone who ha installed smart switch before this wa my first and it wasn t obvious what i should do dumb switch usually have hot in line out and that s it so it not intuitive to add the white wire they should make that clear 4 its white wire requirement cost even more space that i didn t have because i had to add another white wire to the mix 4 it click when it turn off or on 5 that blue light is slightly absurd 6 it had little tab i had to tear off to make two fit next to each other 7 it is not a specialist switch the documentation contained information for 3 or 4 switch and dozen of mode and i had to wade through some nonsense to find information for my use case some might see this a an advantage instead of a drawback but not me i ordered the switch based on my use case if i had need of a different switch i would have ordered it even though my critique may seem a bit harsh i am still happy with the purchase i did not send the product back or shelf it in my shed i used it and smiled when it started working however in my eye a product should be perfect to get five star and at least have zero undocumented surprise to get four most of the switch in my home cost 3 this one cost 50 so i think it should be held to a higher standard one could argue against any one of my bullet point but each is an actual drawback sure the clicking is inherent in smart switch and it deep nature is because of it control board etc etc but in my view those thing are for the manufacturer to figure out not me and when they do they ll get five star,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

great addition to a home automation setup,5.0,i bought three of these with three of the add on switch 12728 to do a couple room in my house and they have worked flawlessly so far the picture in the instruction do a pretty good job of helping translate from a usual 3 way setup to these switch the wiring in my house ha always been a mess but with a little testing of the wire i ended up getting them to work fine note that these are fairly bulky so if you have gang box and you re patient enough it may help to take everything out and shorten the length of wire that are unneeded it took some pushing and using the screw to pull them all the way into the box due to everything behind them i also had to break some piece of plastic off my switch plate because they didn t want to sit close to the large metal face important note when attaching the switch plate you may be tempted to use the screw that were already in it assumin you are replacing existing switch the package includes screw for a good reason the standard one are usually too long you ll find that if you tighten a regular screw all the way in the light will suddenly turn off i don t know if this is some sort of safety feature or if it is shorting the internal circuit but i found that backing the screw out and cycling the air gap switch fixed it the default behavior is to slowly fade on and off but this can be changed through your home automation gateway we d prefer that they turn on off instantly and that requires changing some setting i have the veralite and although i couldn t find any documentation there is some on different style of ge z wave dimmer and that ended up working in device option set parameter 9 number of step valid values 1 99 to 99 and parameter 10 timing of the step valid values 1 255 to 1 this affect the setting when using the physical switch if you want to change how they behave with z wave control use the same logic on parameter 7 and 8 respectively,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works very well and is reliable but not trivial to install,5.0,i have nothing but good thing to say about this switch mine s been turning our porch light on and off automatically controlled by an alarm com security system for many month without a hitch beyond doing what it s supposed to and looking like a normal switch there s not terribly much more than can be said most people won t use any of the advanced feature of the switch like the ability to turn off the blue light because to do so requires an advanced controller which i don t have either update it s now been turning on and off our porch light every day without fail for about a year and a half now perhaps the most useful thing i can say in this review is to warn people that installing it is easy but not trivial it s not just another switch which you can wire by just copying the wiring from the switch it replaces with this z wave switch you need to wire both the load and hot wire in the correct place but you ll also need to wire in a neutral wire so one problem is that if you have an older house or a poorly wired one you may not have a neutral in the box at all you won t be able to use this switch safely if this is the case please don t try using ground a a neutral it may work but it not safe if you don t have a neutral or don t know how to figure that out you can always get the ge 45612 z wave wireless lighting control in wall dimmer the dimmer does install just like a regular switch and can always replace any existing switch if you aren t confident you can figure out which are the hot neutral and load wire in your box you should hire an electrician to install this or just get the dimmer i mention above it s often not a simple a just going by color because thing aren t always wired the way they should be you ll need to know how to use a voltage tester to truly determine which is which and that mean getting near live wire normal switch couldn t care le if you swap load and hot but this switch need all the wire to be exactly correct this fact is probably why there are a smattering of negative review from people who think they have a bad unit certainly some are right but i suspect many of them were trusting the color coding of the wire in their box and just wired the unit with the wrong polarity good luck and have fun,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

the echo wa a breeze to setup and is working flawlessly great purchase the wink hub connected to the amazon,2.0,after reading a lot of product review here on amazon and checking the question to see if i would be running into any problem i ordered 3 of these switch the amazon prime order wa promptly filled and delivered on time i also purchased a wink hub from home depot cheaper price than amazon prime and an amazon echo my intent wa to create a voice control for my patio and office light the echo wa a breeze to setup and is working flawlessly great purchase the wink hub connected to the amazon echo without a problem and now i wa set to install the smart switch a little background on my house it wa built in 1946 and therefore did not include a ground wire in any of the switch box no problem the ge switch install paperwork the ge switch box and all that i could find on the web said that i only need have a neutral white wire and black wire available no problemo installed the switch they all worked in manual mode but try a i might they would not go into pairing mode when attempting to join them to the wink hub according to the ge pamphlet all i needed to do wa touch the top or the bottom of the switch after setting the wink hub to pairing mode and presto it should work son a it would not pair after a long hold on the line i wa able to get to the ge tech support department bad experience the woman who wa helping me had a very bad attitude from the get go after explaining how i hooked up the wire to the switch and hearing her typing feverously in the background she came back with the obvious conclusion that i did not have a ground wire attached this is required she boasted well i responded if wa so damned required why doe it not say so anywhere in the literature included with the product or on the out side of the box it clearly say a neutral wire is required it doe not say a ground wire is required it also say it work with any type of switch wiring wow was i pissed after a couple of beer i got to thinking that there must be a way to get these working light bulb above my head turn on here i cut a piece of wire and attached it to the ground terminal on the switch about 4 inch long as the switch box i wa trying to connect to is made of plastic there wa nowhere to ground it to so i just left it dangle i set the wink hub back to pairing mode and a instructed by the switch install guide i pressed and released the bottom or top of the switch after about 4 or 5 second the switch paired with the hub i then wa able to get alexa to discover my new device and i now have a working voice activated light on my patio i did the same for the switch to my front porch light and to my office and they too paired without complaint the only thing i can think of for the ground wire needing to be attached is to provide an antenna for the pairing it doe not seem to have any other function a i removed them before closing the switch plate and everything still work normally so the moral of this story is two fold 1 never believe a tech support person who ha to type your question into a computer to get an answer that is still wrong 2 american ingenuity is still alive and well p s i mentioned to her that i had read the review and question here on amazon before purchasing and wa promptly told by her we don t pay any attention to amazon review nice to know ge care about it customer opinion of their product and service p s s the two star are not for the product itself but for the install guide and product requirement a listed in their own literature and on the outside of the box and for the lousy tech support i received the product get 5 star it is working very well thank you,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

top value z wave plus dimmer on the market,4.0,amazon lump nearly all of the ge z wave item under the same review this review is specifically for the z wave plus paddle wall dimmer bought a number of these and their jasco equivalent to connect to my smarththings hub to control the light via app and alexa on echo dot evaluating these a a manual dimmer these are very very good when compared to some feit and leviton led dimmer i ve tried the feit dimmer from costco wa the worst it suffered from an ill fitting wall plate that left gap to the wall ever so slight buzzing even with feit led s and it had power issue dim it too low and you induce flicker or the light wont turn back on because the initial power draw is too low using it required dimming to a level that is satisfactory from both a output and power draw standpoint to make sure one can turn the light on and off the leviton unit addressed all these shortcoming but at 20 30 wa rather expensive even without z wave some model are cheaper but none of them are what i would call cheap this ge or really jasco unit strike an excellent compromise on all front a a mechanical dimmer no buzzing with cree or feit led retrofit dims smoothly with no power on off issue the only drawback a a mechanical dimmer is that there is no dedicated slider you hold he up down paddle a needed to get to desired light level the inclusion of z wave is where this shine and the value proposition increase when compared to a 20 30 mechanical dimmer with a smartthings hub it s now a dimmer a timed switch alarm signal etc i have 3 generation of these in the house early gen with no neutral wire z wave with neutral wire and now z wave plus the latest gen support scene better but i haven t quite explored in that direction yet so the only notable difference to me are in installation and dimming performance the latter two have about equivalent performance while the early gen wa easier to install due to one le wire it also doesn t dim a low given minimal cost difference it make sense to buy the latest gen for future functionality upgrade from an install perspective these are quite big and bulky but manageable the contact point are clearly labeled neutral line load ground remote and make me wish regular switch were labeled too but ala that is often not the case since there are a myriad of way to wire them with a voltage meter in hand it should be easy to figure out the wire color are usually white is neutral bare is ground and black can be line or load the voltage meter make it easy to figure out and worth the 20 a part of your general toolbox turn off breaker pull switch out to expose wire turn on breaker set meter to detect 200v ac and touch one lead to ground and the other to either black line withe power on and whichever show 120v is the line wire aka hot turn off the breaker and proceed to install safely you ll have quite a bit of wire and switch to cram back in so the flexible neutral white wire they pack in take at least some of the pain out all the contact are push in screw type so no need to break out plier to bend wire around the screw terminal once i got the hang of identifying wire it became easy to upgrade throughout the house and i m onto 9 switch already so buyer beware these get addictive,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

not very good instruction,4.0,first of all i m not an electrician but i understand the basic concept of electricity since i deal with electricity with my job i decided to replace a pair of basic light switch with these z wave light switch the one i wa replacing only had line load and ground on them with all of the neutral wire bundled in the back of the switch box these z wave switch require a neutral to turn on i beat my head against a wall for about 30 minute trying to figure out how to get the neutral wire to work with this switch i tried the neutral wire on the line side and the neutral from the load side it wouldn t work with either one the instruction weren t the best so i went to the trusty internet to find a solution turns out if you run an additional neutral wire from the z wave switch and bundle it with the other neutral wire in the switch box it work perfectly i wa able to connect it to my house alarm and am able to operate the light via my cell phone or computer they turn on and off my porch and entry light so if i m away for a vacation or something like that i can turn them on and off to give the appearance of the house being occupied also if i forget to turn the light off when i leave i can turn them off remotely also if you are putting 2 of these side by side you may have to trim off the aluminum tab that are on the side i bought the lutron cw 2 wh 2 gang claro wall plate white face plate to go over the top of my switch and had to trim the tab to get the switch to line up with the face plate some of my problem may be common sense to an electrician who ha installed some of these switch before but a i said i m not an electrician so i gave my layman review i only gave 4 star because i had to do some leg work to figure out how to install them but really if there were some better instruction it would have easily been 5 star,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

great but need to improvement,4.0,i had some difficulty setting up the device but that wa more related to my smartthings hub otherwise setup is very easy the biggest part that they could improve on is the fit if you intend on having two of these switch next to each other and having a cover which most of u will the metal frame is too large at first i tried putting one frame in front of the other and it still wouldn t fit eventually i had to take a dremel to shave down the metal frame to allow for the switch to be close enough to each other to fit a cover the back of the device is pretty bulky so you may have to trim some of the wire behind it to allow for room if you are running the switch solo then it won t be a big deal but i had to make some unwanted modification i d still give it 4 stars based on it functionality ease of setup and range,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

stand alone and 3 way switch,5.0,i recently bought two 12722 in wall paddle switch and one 12723 add on switch for use in a 3 way setup i use them with a wink hub 2 and alexa there wa a little trial and error involved but that wa more first time diy than any of the switch fault that said once i got past my minor error it wa a cinch it help to have a multimeter in case you are unsure which black wire are load and line i swapped them on the first try and didn t think to check with my multimeter until well after doh tips it help to have a multimeter on hand in case you need to verify thing if you re wiring a 3 way you will need a spare wire nut to complete the job the back of these switch are pretty bulky adjust and move wire in the box a much a possible because these switch make the wiring in the box extra crowded i recommend placing some electrical tape over all your screw terminal especially if your ground wire in the box are just bare copper those spacer tab on the switch are ridiculous and you ll almost definitely need to remove them if it s not the only switch in the box do so before you start don t forget to use the jumper wire that come with these switch to connect to neutral the metal plate that frame the switch wa thicker than on my old switch that were staying in the box with them i had to carve a slight recess so that the new switch and old switch would line up flush once the faceplate wa on i had one electrical box that wa installed too deeply into the wall and the screw that come with the switch didn t quite reach due to the extra thickness of the metal plate i bought some longer screw at the hardware store 6 32 is the screw type you want if you find yourself in the same boat i wired one room with a single 12722 and it is pretty straight forward assuming you don t mix them up like i did connect your load black usually or red depending on what wa in the switch you re replacing and line wire 120v common black to the corresponding terminal it s all labeled on the back of the switch you ll have to connect a ground wire a well a the white neutral wire do not remove a neutral from the bundled wire nut in the box you ll end up with an open neutral and the switch won t work if you connect it that way use the white jumper wire that come with the switch and add it to the bundle of neutral wire that s it switch wired next i did a 3 way with a 12722 and the 12723 add on this is a little different from wiring regular 3 way switch i recommend first identifying where your primary zwave switch is going with your trusty multimeter because it will determine how much work you will have to do the way my existing 3 way switch were wired i had 120v on one side only primary if i d wanted to move my primary to the auxiliary side i would have had to cut and combine wire placing another wire nut in the box with multiple wire coming out of it i opted not to do that since space is at a premium basically you just wire the the 12722 zwave switch up like a stand alone on the primary side but also add the traveler wire red in my case on the auxiliary side the 12723 add on switch is only going to need neutral jumper ground and the traveler match the color from the primary side the add on doe not use the load or line wire that were plugged into the old auxiliary switch at all instead you need a spare wire nut so you can combine these two together and then shove them into the back of the box basically this mean that only the primary zwave switch will be switching power to the load the add on switch is only there to tell the primary via the traveler that it button wa pressed which cause the primary to switch on off,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

great product a little tough for installation without the best instruction,4.0,okay first the product doe exactly what it is supposed to it work a a 3 way or 4 way switch on a circuit in your house a long a you have the ge primary switch in that circuit one cool feature is that up is always on down is always off and if your primary switch is a summer then this one will also dim the light so instead of a single dimmer on a multi switch circuit you have dimmer capability on every switch now the bad part the wiring if you are an electrician don t worry everyone else keep reading the ge primary switch is the only switch in the circuit that ha 110v in it once you go this route the other switch have only the low voltage signal provided from the extra terminal on the back of the primary what this mean is if your 3 or 4 way wiring ha power on one end and the light on the other you need to wire it up to pas the power all the way to the switch with the light directly and then wire up the low voltage communication wire to reach the switch in the other direction before you start you need to figure out which switch are 3 way and which are 4 way the four way will have two set of two wire called traveler you will find two three way switch they have one le wire you need to know which is connected to power and which is connected to the light the simple way to do this is to disconnect the wire and carefully measure the voltage when you turn the circuit on be careful on this step so i will talk about a 4 way since 3 way is the same without the middle switch on 4 way you will have two wire coming into the switch and two going out called traveler these are used to switch the four way circuit on 3 way installation there is a single set of traveler use them a i describe below for the two end switch on 4 way you usually you ll have a red and black traveler coming in and the same going out so for all the 4 way switching in your circuit connect the red in to red out with a screw cap then black to black i chose to use the black for power and red for low voltage signal so connect ground to the white ground bundle in the outlet connect the red wire to your only other terminal low voltage signal in your add on switch and you re done with this switch on the end with the light you will put your master switch connect the incoming black traveler to the 110v terminal white bundle ground to ground connect the wire to the light to the light terminal and the incoming red traveler to the low voltage signal terminal after you remove the tape this is done finally the other end you will use an add on switch here and connect the red traveller to the low voltage terminal you will connect the power into the outgoing black traveller you connect the ground to the white bundle in the socket you are now good to go all the box have the red traveller connected to the low voltage connector the black traveller connects from one end to 110v hot down to the other into the primary switch hot connector the light connects to the primary switch light connector they all have ground now turn on the power and you re good to go,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

better than a traditional 3 way switch,5.0,i recently wired about 22 z wave switch into my home for automation through the wink hub in doing so i experimented with a number of configuration including this ge 12723 paired with a ge12722 switch for a 3 way configuration most of my 3 way used lutron caseta dimmer with remote control since they were actually a little cheaper than the pair of ge switch and the lutron s provided dimming capability however this particular switch wa connected to my outdoor security light and i definitely didn t want them on a dimmer the way my house wa wired the hot wire for the 3 way wa in the garage box while the load wire wa by the front door i wanted the hot wire to be at the front door so i could see the on off indicator led on the switch from inside i changed the recommended wiring provided by ge to use one of the original traveler wire to send hot to the front door ge 12722 switch the second traveler wire became the traveler for the connection between the ge 12722 and ge 12723 all in all it worked like a charm why is it better than a traditional 3 way switch since the traveler connecting the switch sends on off signal between the switch the off position is always off on both switch and the on position is always on you don t have to worry about the switch position changing every time you turn the switch on or off at a different location the ge 12722 connects into the wink hub a a generic z wave switch the current version of software ha no problem reading the on off state of the ge switch the ge 12723 doesn t have to be paired with the hub since the ge 12722 doe all the z wave communication,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

very pleased,5.0,we came close to installing control 4 until it wa explained to u we would have to use a vendor every time we wanted to reprogram a device something that would become very expensive this is when we started to explore other solution we ended up going with wink and a such looked at several zwave device to prototype we tried two other switch made by other company but ended up buying many many more of these ge switch a we continue to automate the whole house the automation is just incredible and these switch work perfectly with the wink system though i am sure they work with any wave system we have the house programed with these switch for multiple mode throughout the day wakeup for running breakfast midday evening and nighttime mood of course wink robot take care of all that then we use the switch a part of if then scenario if somebody walk up to the front door the z wave motion sends a signal to wink that confirms this switch is on so our porch foyer and living room light are on automatically and this switch responds perfectly everytime you pay a little more but all i can say is they work every time given how frustrating electronics can be it is nice to get something that work a advertised everytime i also liked how this switch us slot in the back much like the push in slot on regular receptacle except on these they use a screw to tighten them to ensure they are snug makes attaching the wire very easy and quick to install leaving a lot of space to install the larger space taken up by the switch size itself a downfall of all the zwave switch resembles a gfi switch in size so you can appreciate not needing to use the extra wire nut don t leave many review but these switch earned my recommendation if i could improve one thing it would be nice if they used a full led line under or around the entire paddle to act a a night light or simple to highlight where the switch wa at night,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works great love it,5.0,i wa going to give this 4 star because of how difficult it wa to link up to my wink hub but i decided that wouldn t be fair because the issue wa with the wink app hub not this device the device wa easy to install and it only actually took about 10 minute to install in place of my existing fan switch they include an extra white wire in the box so you can run the required neutral connection to the device if you aren t comfortable or knowledgeable with electrical wiring get someone who is to install this a it doe require some electrical skill once the unit wa installed i wa able to test it manually tap the top of the switch to turn the fan on tap the bottom to turn it off press and hold the top to increase the fan speed press and hold the bottom to decrease the speed linking to my wink controller wasn t a straight forward a i d hoped wink includes a bar code scan option to scan the device bar code you re installing and wink will automatically load up the configuration option for you i scanned the bar code and wink told me this wa an unsupported device it s not really it s just not automatic out of the box so i went the manual route now when selecting the device to install i picked a ge in wall smart switch from the utilities and climate because that section show ceiling fan tried several time and it kept failing with the this is taking too long error i finally called wink support they were very helpful btw and got it straightened out pretty quick they told me i needed to install it a a lighting dimmer module i wish there wa something in the documentation that mentioned this even the wink support page for this device just say follow the manufacturer direction to install but the included instruction just say to follow the z wave controllers instructions to add the device kind of a catch 22 anyway with wink support on the phone we tried adding it a a lighting dimmer module and that didn t work still so the tech had me put the hub in z wave exclusion mode if you re not familiar with this there s online information to remove the device from the hub then put the hub in z wave inclusion mode to add the device kind of back dooring it well this worked fine and the device showed up a a ge lamp in my device list i wa able to edit the device and correctly show it a a fan controller by picking a custom icon the thing work great it say on the box you can set high medium and low speed you have to figure out what level in wink trigger each speed a wink will allow you to set any percent level 0 100 to the module just like a dimmer but the unit will only drive the fan in 3 speed i believe 20 35 is low 36 80 is medium 81 100 is high at least on mine,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

wonderful but need some finishing touch,3.0,this is a general review for all of the ge jasco smart switch these are great little switch i am very impressed with them and will continue buying them i got one from lowes that apparently had a bad radio in it but upon further inspection this appeared to be a unit that had already been returned and placed back on the shelf i have a few issue with these though 1 if setting up a multi switch circuit many electrician today only run the two traveler wire to the second box this save money however these box require a neutral wire not the earth ground using the earth ground will result in a back flow of electricity that may cause your light to turn on even when the switch are off in addition using the earth ground is unsafe with that said ge need to come up with a way to make a switch pair that will work without a neutral at the second switch all of the other vendor i have found are the same way and i would rate them down for that short coming a well 2 the unit ship with two screw to screw the faceplate that you provide to the switch i didn t use mine instead i just used the one i already had however on the dimmer switch there is a air gap switch that allows you to turn off the switch completely rather than just dim to 0 apparently if you use a full size screw to attach the faceplate it press against something that engages the airgap switch 3 for multi switch circuit installs the add on switch do not have a z wave radio in them this mean that they cannot be used to extend your zwave network yes it would cost a little more but especially in home that have not embraced smart switch and z wave device the way i have ever z wave repeater help,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

awsome product slightly annoying delay problem,4.0,this review is for the light switch i already had a different smart light switch but it connected directly to my wifi which i really liked seeing a i didn t have a zwave hub at the time however when it came time to install two of these switch in a single box i ran into a problem because it used wire nut and extra wire and there wasn t any room for it all in the box at that point i decided to try these ge light switch it didn t connect the wire via wire nut and instead the wire connected directly into the light switch saving a lot of room it wa still a tight fit considering how much larger these smart switch are but at least it fit another pro for this light switch is the rocker remains in a neutral position and you touch the top part to turn the light on and the bottom part to turn the light off intuitive since this is how all light switch work the one i replaced had the rocker always in the traditional on position and you pushed the bottom part of the rocker to toggle between off and on people were confused a to how to work the light switch the first time they used it the other pro about these light switch is they come ready to be used in a 3 way switch seeing a i have about six 3 way switch in my house i also thought it would be good to have all switch be the same rather than have some switch be one kind of switch and the 3 way be a different kind so this wa a major plus too also these switch have a blue light on them that you can control to have the light always on when the switch is on or always on when the switch is off or never on it s a nice feature to put this in your control the only drawback and the reason this is only getting 4 star instead of 5 is there is a delay between turning the switch on off and the light actually turning on off it s not a huge delay i ve timed it and it s about 4 second but it s still pretty annoying considering every switch i have ever used in my entire life ha been instant and this includes the smart switch i wa using prior to this ge model this delay is present when manually operating the switch itself using my smart things app and when using amazon alexa i ve timed it with alexa and it take about 3 second for the light to turn on via alexa whereas my old smart switch took about 1 5 second via the smart things app it s really about the same delay a manually touching the switch about 4 second again not the end of the world but slightly annoying i m sure i ll get used to it eventually just kind of weird that they would design this with a delay seeing a apparently it s possible to create a smart switch that doe not have a delay,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

work with wink app and alexa with an addon swtich for 3 way,5.0,work perfect with the wink app and then with alexa too we ahve a 3way so we also got the add on switch your switch will control the light and take power but hte addon only need the traveler and the ground the two switch communicate from zigbee and essentially the main switch is the only one that will control the light the only issue we had wa figuring out our wire we got the addon for the second swtich and that wa the complicated part our wiring wa ridiculous in the dining room we had 3 black wire one red copper white so we know the neutral is white and the copper is ground red should be the traveler to communicate between switch what were the 3 black one wa a second traveler we found out and second wa power and the third for some reason wa the wall circuit in the living room we had the kitchen light on what this wa for but the tv in the living room stopped working ugh haha and the dining room connection did not have a wire to the light this proved difficult a this is where this swtich ha to go and the addon switch go in the living room but the addon switch only ha a port for the ground and traveler it ha no power or load port ended up having to double hook up the wall circuit one with the power in this one ha two port for each connection so yay and put the second blakc traveler on the load port the red traveler on the travler port make sure you hook up the neutral and ground or it wont work then on the addon switch we took the red traveler into the traveler port and connected teh grond these are the only two port available then we had the wire to the light hanging there and the second blakc traveler we twisted those together and bam finally worked now alexa turn on the kitchen light work love it,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
you might need a wire nut,5.0,if you ve already installed one of the master switch one of these is super easy it doesn t even take load line wire just neutral traveler and ground on that note it s not obviously clear in the instruction that you do need to connect the line and load wire back together in the box i guess it s obvious when you actually think about how electricity work but at least in my box there wa no wire nut on either the load or line wire fortunately i had an extra wire nut i could use to connect them together and i wa good to go otherwise easy install great result highly addictive update amazon ha since consolidated this with the main switch so i can only add image to this review i m adding a basic diagram of what i did to wire up 4 switch in the same gangbox update 2 i ve recently discovered you can actually daisy chain these switch because each one ha two connector port for each wire type that mean you can have a neutral wire coming in and then another coming out that you can route to the next ge switch no need to route them both individually to a big wire nut in the back,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

great addition to a home automation setup,5.0,the main thing to start out with is that this is an add on switch and will not control light on it s own it can t switch 120v itself but is meant to be used with something such a the ge 12729 dimmer i purchased 3 pair of the 12729 and 12728 to set up three room of my house setup definitely read the instruction and consult an electrician if you need but i ll describe it in my own word the easiest wa to think of this switch is a a remote that control the main z wave enabled one where a normal 3 or 4 way setup will run one power wire line to the first switch then through two wire usually black and red until the last switch and one load to the light in this case the power line go to the ge 12729 and right on to the light because you run the main switch right to the light where the in between old switch had a black in and black out just wire nut these together so power is uninterrupted to the light then where the old one had a red in and red out these are what you hook up to this item you can daisy chain a many a you want back to the control switch the wiring in my house ha always been a mess but with a little testing of the wire i ended up getting them to work fine note that these are fairly bulky so if you have gang box and you re patient enough it may help to take everything out and shorten the length of wire that are unneeded it took some pushing and using the screw to pull them all the way into the box due to everything behind them i also had to break some piece of plastic off my switch plate because they didn t want to sit close to the large metal face important note when attaching the switch plate you may be tempted to use the screw that were already in it assuming you are replacing existing switch the package includes screw for a good reason the standard one are usually too long you ll find that if you tighten a regular screw all the way in the light will suddenly turn off i don t know if this is some sort of safety feature or if it is shorting the internal circuit but i found that backing the screw out and cycling the air gap switch fixed it these have worked flawlessly for month now on a veralite so i would highly recommend see my review on ge 12729 for some tip on z wave control setting,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works reliably well once installed and programmed you forget it s there,4.0,switch work reliably well this switch 12727 is the main unit in any z wave controlled light circuit this is the device that pair with your z wave router and that doe get programmed if your circuit ha more than one switch the other switch need to be auxiliary sku 12728 example a foyer light that ha three switch one of these three switch need to be the main unit sku 12727 and the two others are auxiliary if your circuit only ha a single switch that single switch must be the main unit 12727 not the auxiliary unit it is not a good idea to mix z wave with non z wave dumb switch on the same circuit i have three of these circuit in my house all professionally installed and they work like a charm can be programmed into scene can be monitored and turned on off with my smartphone and can be tied to event one of these circuit is illuminating the view for security camera yes they integrate very well into adt pulse,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works great with alexa and google home,5.0,finally found a fan switch that i can control the speed of the fan with voice command this work great with smartthings and controlling the fan with the smartthings app alexa or google home it doe get recognized a a dimmer with smartthings but it is just using the 3 speed and not infinite setting like someone mentioned when you tell alexa to set the speed at a range between 1and 32 it us the low setting between 33 and 66 it us the medium setting and above that it us the high setting so for example if i say alex set the fan to 50 the fan speed will be set to the medium speed setting one quirk with google home is that she will return a response something like setting the fan brightness to 50 because of smartthings recognizing the switch a a dimmer all in all i am very satisfied with the switch,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
good but some info i wish i had at the beginning,4.0,i dont normally write review but i thought i would since there is some conflicting information here and some info i wish i had when i started first the unit operates a expected and the paring with my hub wa no problem a couple of note on the install first the infamous neutral wire i ve seen comment answer saying you do and you do not need one i m experience you absolutely need it also this is not the ground wire it s different i wa initially confused because my existing switch didnt have a neutral wire but my house is fairly new also it didnt help i didnt know what a neutral wire wa after some research and pulling everything out of the electrical box i found the house had a neutral wire it just wasnt used needed for the switch i had so it wa just twisted into the back of the electrical box i expect this may be the case for many others also the instruction with the switch dont actually show the neutral connected to the switch in the diagram it s just mentioned briefly the second thing to note is that if you are doing this for a 3 way switch install you have to also buy the add on switch s a 3 way switch is when you have one light controlled by more than one switch so one switch ha to be this one and all others for that light need to be replaced with the add on switch this may be obvious to an electrician or networking type person but wasnt to me ultimately i m happy with the finished product i just wish some of the instruction were presented a little more obviously,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

end of line switch user beware two update,3.0,update added at end of initial review i want to write this review because i hope it save someone from having a wasted two day like i just had after buying this yesterday bottom line up front if you have an end of line switch which can be determined by looking at the switch once removed from the box if it ha one line of wire coming in and within that wire it contains a white black and a ground wire that s an end of line what that mean is that the electricity is coming from the light fixture to the switch vice the opposite now many reviewer will tell you that you don t need a common usually white wire the reviewer and many expert will tell you that the solution is to determine the load and line and simply install them to their corresponding place on the switch well here s some problem with all that first end of line wiring involves for reason only real electrician know that the white wire that ultimately appear in your box is wired to a black wire and thus becomes hot the black wire go from the light to the receptacle is used to essentially relay the switch command to the light now if that black wire is going to do that how doe it also perform the function of a common wire which involves transmitting low level electricity to the switch and guess what without it a doc brown would say this damned thing doesn t work now to say i had an adventure would be a great understatement i ve installed a wemo switch installed about ten wireless device ranging from myq to rainman to arlo to 110 outlet with usb outlet to tpc lighting to nest thermostats three including the most complex duel fuel that said i don t claim to be an electrician and i am smart enough to know that it will kill you or burn your house down or both but i am capable of reading research and watching some pretty good video that are out there i spent much of the last two day trying the find the answer to my issue copy and paste this link this is the only reference and i looked at thousand of page that discus this issue i tried various trick and made many mistake first mistake wa assuming the black wa the line and the white the load that s not right for the reason outlined previously i tried the white wire which keep in mind is hot into the common position and wa lucky to notice the switch wa getting warm not right i tried a many will tell you hot wire to line and other wire to load it won t even power on in that mode i tried hot wire to line and black wire common to common it wa then that i got the blue led power indicator and smart things detected the switch in a few second flat here wa the problem no way to turn the light off i wa actually using this on a ceiling fan light that i new when i installed it 15 year ago that i d be largely reliant on largely pull chain but when i hooked the switch up hot to line and black wire to common in addition to not being able to turn the light off when i put more than one blub in they went into a blinking mode the fan also would not respond so after a score two of tripping to the basement two floor below where my main breaker box is located i found this no common wire at the end of the line equal this switch being worthless i do have two other candidate location in my house so i m going to give those a try there as bad a i hate to add about the fourth brand name of wireless device but i m going to have to shop for one that requires no common wire my first thought when reflecting on my adventure is that i m really not only disappointed at ge and the maker for not having this little tidbit in their description or at least more detail about this potential issue but in the end i ll just chalk up this adventure a being beneficial for future electrical experience update i moved this device down to my foyer where there is a double gang that control the foyer light and the outside porch light i decided to relocate the switch there because i thought it might be easier than placing it in a three gang box that control my flood light another location that i ll add a wireless switch when i got the switch cover off and the screw out to see what wa in the box i saw the bundled white wire and then something i hadn t previously noticed i had changed out to paddle switch throughout the house a couple of year ago so i have some familiarity with the wiring in the house but i unexpectedly found one black wire on the switch that control the foyer light wa wrapped around one of the screw on the paddle i m sure it wa wired this way when the house wa built and i d simple moved it when installing the paddle switch that threw me back a bit a far a determining the load and line then it hit me that the wrapped around wire would be the line wire and the other the load so i wired those accordingly to the ge wireless switch and then ran the jumper wire from the white bundle to the common connector i did have to get a larger connector to work with the expanded wiring i turned the power on and turned the light on and immediately had control manually over the light and got the led when i turned it off and i went to smart things and the app almost immediately recognized the switch and the setup wa easy i programmed the light to come on for about an hour when i normally walk my pup i turned off the electricity again because i knew it wa going to be a challenge to get the larger ge switch to fit in along side the paddle switch first step is to break off the three tab on each side doing it with needle nose plier wa a challenge so i switch to larger regular plier i had success just securing each tab with the plier then moving the switch back and forth until each one broke off my load wire kept jumping out even when tightened a tight a i could get it i removed about another 1 8 inch of insulation on the wire to allow it to go deeper into the switch and once i did that no more problem like i said a challenge to get the wireless switch seated properly in the gang box but when i did all worked a intended please allow me to say this this is where ge go wrong their marketing is designed to show how simple the switch is to install and suggest anyone can do the installation what they miss is that rarely will you find an outlet that is a easy to wire a the scenario they pick in their promos to make it look easy chances are you will not find too many situation like that and you are more apt to be challenged with the end of line scenario i first described and then the challenge with the pigtail wiring or whatever it s called that i encountered at the second location so about 15 hour of work research and a lot of trial and error i now have the switch installed and working properly update on second install i wanted to add a switch for my flood light and purchased a second one of these from amazon this wa quite a bit different install a it wa in a three gang box that contained two different circuit with one having the third red wire for switching if that wasn t enough i d had a real electrician run a 110 outlet a few foot below and centered on the wall he had tied into one of the circuit in the switch box to run that line i noticed that when i turned of the circuit breaker at the main box and then came back up stair that my kitchen light had no power but my dining area s light were still on so i brought out the reliable circuit tester powered by fresh battery and sure enough the line i wa going to work on had no power but one of the switch wa still hot since the hot switch wa at one end and the switch i wanted to trade out wa at the other end i thought i could make the swap without turning off more power however when i got the flood light switch removed from the gang box i could see all three switch were going to have to be loosened and moved out to do the wiring and arrang several bundle of wire the trick is to get those bundle behind the two smaller switch where all space is left open to receive the ge switch i wa further advantaged in that i wa working on an older gang box that may be somewhat smaller than today s model the ge furnished common wire turned out to be far too short since i had to run the wire from the white bundle that would be located at opposite end of the gang box i had some extra wire laying around and cut a piece about 5 or 6 inch and it turned out i needed every bit of that length after several minute of wrangling i managed to get everything in place hardest part wa just getting everything lined up and i ended up getting two longer screw than those provided to seat the switch on the gang when i powered up i used the smart things app and it detected the new switch in five second flat i assigned a room and programmed to come on when i walk the pup worked like a charm last night overall the wiring on this wa a cinch after my experience with wiring first one all the challenge on this one wa just getting it to fit the dude that wired four of these switch in a four gang box you got to admire that,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

good but not perfect,4.0,works well the led is on when the outlet is off and it s a bright blue led that is super annoying at night in a bedroom but that can be changed if you have a remote or a controller that can send very specific command i wish there wa a way to program it from the pairing button itself like a very long press other than that it s a basic standard ge outlet the bottom outlet is the one controlled the top one is always on the twist connector coming in the box are likely useless for you if you have more than one wire to connect to in the electricity box so keep that in mind get some bigger one based on the size and number of wire to connect together also do not forget to buy a faceplate the faceplate are not included super cheap on amazon so add on item for prime better order all at the same time if some wonder a all plugged in device versus battery device this act a a z wave repeater i bought a few and if they last i ll likely buy a few more so 4 star good,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

good switch some diy installation tip,4.0,identical to ge switch in every way like all zwave switch install is tricky due to space constraint includes perfectly with my vera lite in earlier firmware version a well a the latest ui7 and is detected correctly a an on off switch to include just press the switch with the zwave controller very close by these are wide switch but they fit just side by side with standard building quality light switch in multi switch box i would not recommend installing 2 of these in the same wall box but feel free to try i like the blue led which make it easy to see at night as they have a neutral they work with led and cfl which turn 100 off when locally or remotely switched to off unlike the dimmer version where the led light are still at 50 and cfl s flicker a they have no neutral install requires a neutral wire so make sure you have wire nut and some extra 20 gauge jumper wire handy i like the way these switch install a they have actual contact rather than silly 22 gauge braided wire pigtail the contact support both push in wiring or you can make a loop and hook around the screw terminal a well this make it far easier to retrofit and you do not need extra wire nut for line load with the added benefit of requiring le space in an already crowded electrical box its likely you will need both jumper wire and 2 x wire nut for neutral and earth though the easiest install method for single pole is to cut a 7 long white jumper wire for neutral and a 7 bare copper wire for ground from some 3 core wire stripping around 3 4 from each end connect the white neutral to the existing bunch of neutral wire in the box by removing the existing wire nut adding in your new jumper wire then replacing the wire nut you may need to use a larger wire nut connect the ground the same way to the existing ground wire s you should now have the 2 original black wire from the standard builder switch line load a well a 6 long jumper for neutral white and ground bare copper for a total of 4 wire coming out of your wall box connect all four wire to your new jasco ge switch a per the instruction on line load neutral ground and it will work every time install for 2 way switch is the same extra work with the neutral wire but you need 2 different model of jasco ge switch and they must be wired in a very specific order model 45609 is the main switch and the second switch is a special auxiliary model 45610 connected to each other via a traveler wire the newbie mistake on these ge jasco zwave switch and i see a ton of them in opened package at lowest after being returned is to miss the neutral wire a the original builder switch don t have these the neutral wire is needed to power the zwave radio and the blue led when the switch is in the off position,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

some installation tips and descriptions,5.0,i purchased this switch to work with my smartthings hub this being the first smartthing it took a bit of research to install the product look great the led light at the bottom of the switch can be configured to always off on when light is on or on when light is off through the smartthings app it s nice to be able to turn the led to always off for use in a bedroom i have no experience wiring electrical outlet but i took this on after watching the installation video a few time it wa pretty straight forward i just copied the config from the old switch it is very important to have that neutral wire attached you cannot go without it the switch will not work there is a neutral wire included in the bottom of the box along with the extra ivory colored paddle after install i wa a bit confused with getting the switch connected to the hub but after a bit of research found that you begin your search with the smartthings hub and turn the switch on then off connected right up remember this it s not stated in the paper direction very clearly i found that fitting this switch into the box in the wall the screw mount catch on the neutral wire connection since i have another switch to replace with a smart switch for this 2 gang box in the future i m unsure if this will interfere with the installation of the face plate cover this switch can also be used a a 3 way switch and you do have to buy the the add on switch for the other end the switch are stationary they click when you press the on or off button they do not flip like traditional paddle switch the light switch ocd in me love that because there isn t one switch in the on position and the other switch in the off position in a 3 way configuration they all look the same i m looking very forward to completing my switch conversion and will be choosing this ge z wave switch for the entire project,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
intermediate installation knowledge required more advanced than typical switch replacement,4.0,i would have rated this 4 star however installation wa a bear for me i m just a basic handyman around the house and have installed many a replacement switch however this one threw several curveballs a the marketing and product disclosure could have been more informative if being used on a 3 way switch i e 2 light switch then you must also buy the add on companion switch to replace the other switch that control the same light these should be sold a z wave control for one light switch circuit and z wave control for 2 light switch 3 way circuit if using on a light with two switch this system will only work if you replace both the primary z wave and the add on switch it s not a preference it s a requirement b next you have to figure out which switch box is the wired a the primary and which is the add on i m no electrician but after about 12 hour of youtube based learning resorted to using a multimeter i had initially tried a pen voltage detecter but it wa not able to differentiate between hot wire and cold wire which i guess technically have a volt or two for carious reason with the multimeter 1 hour of youtube learning i could easily see the hot wire v cold wire when check each of the 4 combination of on off possible on on on off off on off off among my two switch to determine which had a wire that wa always hot not matter what this is the primary switch directly connected to the fuse box i learned that my primary wa the opposite switch than i initially thought thank goodness it wa within range of my nexia router through additional test i verified which wire were trailer 1 and 2 also necessary to continue the installation perhaps this would have ben quicker if i were an electrician c i wa also thrown off by the neutral wire but that wa simple enough once i learned more about it simple enough d the add on switch requires the installer to use a wire nut not supplied to merge the t1 and the load wire the one that go out to the light i would say i spent 6 hour with the main switch until i learned i needed the add on after receiving that delivery a week later i spent another 6 hour learning the wiring knowledge described in b c and d above i would say this install is not for rookie who are not able to spend time learning the concept of 3 way wiring and establishing a comfort level with which wire doe what in their particular system my house is only a couple year old and ha fresh wiring and gang box that follow current city code yet most house don t come with documentation explaining the electrical wiring schema once connected i fired it up and shazaam it worked great and easily connected to the nexia yay,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
better than tp link,5.0,this ge unit is the second brand in my smart home the first wa the tp link switch in my experience with this ge unit i found the installation reasonably comparable to the tp link unit to install as a person with very little residential electrical knowledge the instruction are a bit confusing but luckily the wire are color coded i originally purchased the tp link smart switch because it doe not require a hub and it ha a nice premium look to it however i found the tp switch to be frustrating unreliable a other reviewer have experienced perhaps i have a bad unit but for my particular unit the connection often cut off and i m forced to reset the switch to reconnect this defeat the purpose of having a smart switch if it so unreliable that i have to walk to the switch to reset to remotely access it again for the ge unit a hub is required so i have paired it to a samsung smartthing so far i have found the connection to be reliable there have not been a single instance when the light doesn t do what i ask using alexa due to a bad connection another added benefit of being paired to smartthing is being able to control all the various light under different smart switch at once tp link is noticeably missing from being compatible from smartthings and therefore i cannot add it to a room or scene to control together despite the average design it look like any normal household light switch i would go with the ge switch for it reliability and compatibility,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
exactly what i wanted,5.0,updated review i reached out to jasco about the ramp rate not working a intended i received a very informative response from the project managers apparently the device wa operating a designed however jasco ha since modified the existing firmware with a new parameter to allow you to adjust the behavior i tested it on my dimmer and it worked a stated very happy with the product and jasco customer service response from jasco thank you for contacting jasco products company here is the response from our product managers we apologize for the amount of information we need to provide to accurately answer your question but unfortunately there is some bad information being spread about what you are describing first and foremost the ge dimmer 12724 and 14294 do not require a patch or bug fix a there is not a problem or incorrect behavior both unit operate correctly a they were designed all of our previous dimmer including 12724 used to ramp slowly when being sent a level specific command 1 100 we then updated our 12724 product with enhancement that added additional routing option and to take advantage of the latest z wave technology when we did this we had to upgrade the behavior of the dimmer to the latest spec a defined for z wave certification this new specification requires that when receiving a level specific command 1 100 the device is required to immediately jump to that level any z wave classic dimmer including 12724 that ha ver 3 0d and earlier on the back of the product will ramp slowly to the specific level when issued a level specific command any z wave classic dimmer including 12724 that ha ver 3 0e this is the last version produced on our z wave classic product on the back carry this new behavior any z wave plus dimmer including 14294 will carry this new behavior because this is a requirement for z wave certification the product must ship with the newest behavior a default however understanding that our customer may want the previous behavior we developed a new configurable parameter into our latest ge 14294 and jasco 14321 in wall smart dimmer dim up down rate parameter number 6 size 1 byte valid values o 0 default new required behavior instantly move to level o 1 ramp up and down slowly 3 0d and previous version behavior you can determine if the ge 14294 jasco 14321 ha this feature by verifying the manufacturer date code on the front of the dimmer in the bottom right hand corner it will be a small white sticker with 4 number the first 2 number are the year it wa manufactured example 17 2017 the last 2 number are the week it wa manufactured example 07 7th week 2017 or 3rd week of february 2017 any ge 14294 manufactured on or after 1651 will contain this new parameter 6 any jasco 14321 manufactured on or after 1705 will contain this new parameter 6 original review so this device 14294 wa almost what i expected apparently the dimmer doe not ramp up correctly when the command is issued via zwave it jump immediately to the set level regardless of the parameter setting the only time the ramp rate work a designed is when going to 0 any other level jump straight there the ramp rate work correctly when issued from the switch itself however very disappointed i m still inside my return window and will likely send these back if i can t find out if a firmware update might correct this behavior,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
easy installation solid connection to wink hub good ergonomics,5.0,i have 8 of these ge 12722 switch scattered throughout the house i bought them after comparing to the linear counterpart the linear wa a cheaper construction had side tab that were hard to remove and that bent the metal can while trying run enough quiescent power to stay warm continuously and doesn t give a tactile feedback when switched when compared to the ge this ge switch us connection to the neutral line to enable an internal power supply this mean you don t have to worry about the impedance of the load to provide grounding for the internal power supply or the need for a dummy load if the impedance is too high since the internal power supply run a relay the switch can power most any type of device incandescent light cfls leds fan etc all the switch paired easily with my wink hub with the wink s hub recent software update the switch reliably report their on off status i wired one in a 3 way configuration using the ge12723 companion auxiliary switch the instruction would have had me with the master switch in the garage and the auxiliary switch without a status light inside however i wanted the status light inside so i modified the suggested wiring using the spare traveler wire to route the hot line to the indoor box my only suggestion to ge would be to automatically dim the indicator light at night it can be a bit bright when all the light are off,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
had some issue with installtion,3.0,i installed this switch in about an hour i had two problem 1 the wiring in my house is unconventional or at least i think so 2 had issue pairing with the wink hub even though i had neutral they weren t being used on top of that the traveler wire wa connected i tried following the direction and simply connecting the neutral load line in the standard configuration but the light wouldn t work i had to connect the load and the line wire to the load connection and the traveler wire to the line neutral ground a usual i included picture 2 i tried using the scan bar code in the wink app in order to quickly pair the switch however i received the message this device is supported yet if it wasn t for the review and google i would ve thought i had made a bad purchase when i wa going through the pairing process i kept getting the message this taking longer than usual would you like to retry or cancel after several time i decided to go back to mr google for help as i wa searching i so happen to grab my phone when i did i looked at the wink app and noticed there wa a new light icon i tested the light and it worked a required so my biggest issue with the device is that it didn t signal me to that the device wa paired and the wink app never gave me a success or looked a if it completed the process however after these hurdle the device worked a expected oh a a few other ppl have stated after i installed it i wa no longer able to use the face trim plate the manual slide at th bottom of the toggle prevents the plate from going back on,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
unreliable and difficult to install but don t require a neutral wire,1.0,i loathe and despise these switch unfortunately a far a i can tell i m stuck with them if i want a little bit of automation why because my house is old and ha a lot of switch loop wiring so unless i want to rewire my house nope these are the only z wave compatible switch available in beige that don t require a neutral my other option is the now defunct activehome system which i had and which worked perfectly for the past 15 year but are now starting to behave erratically barf why do i hate them let me count the way just two really 1 they are soooo difficult to install you insert the wire under the appropriate screw and then tighten it sounds easy right nope the screw kind of float until you tighten them this isn t uncommon and wouldn t be a problem except that ge decided to bury the screw in a freakin small trench there isn t enough clearance between the screw the plastic switch housing around it to just slip a wire around easily you have to thread it from the opening on the back which when gravity decides to do it s thang with the floaty screw becomes an amazing exercise in frustration especially when 2 the switch often don t work i have 2 light i need automated two i am now on switch number 5 6 these thing fail like dot com startup you fight through getting them wired up turn on the power and they don t work if you look at these thing wrong they ll fuse open or closed and then it s game over man they re apparently very sensitive little device and the slightest anything unusual just break them i have 3 of these piece of junk sitting on my table representing about 120 of wasted money,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
very unreliable when sending status back to the hub,1.0,i have a large lutron caseta installation at home and i wanted to try some z wave switch in my network for simple on off load i bought eight of these switch to use with my wink hub 2 and installed two of them they were in the next room from the hub separated by perhaps ten foot of a drywall wood stud wall they paired fairly quickly with the wink hub 2 and could be controlled reasonably quickly when i pressed the icon on the wink app or used alexa however feedback from the switch would take about 30 second this would manifest in several way one of which wa the wink app not updating the change in status of the controlled light for that period of time and the other more troubling and what killed the deal for me a wink robot that i created that would sense when the switch wa turned on from the physical switch itself and then turn on another light would take 30 second for the other device to react you can imagine what a horrible user experience this is i tried several z wave network command such a rediscovering the network a few time and resetting the complete network so i had to re pair all my z wave device only the two switch so no big deal but nothing seemed to help i am uninstalling these two switch and returning all eight i have exceeded my tolerance for trying to get what should be simple technology to work a advertised i ordered four homeseer hs ws100 z wave plus scene capable wall switch works with amazon alexa switch and will try those when they arrive if i still get marginal bi directional z wave performance i m going to bail on z wave light control i ll still use it for sensor because the wink hub 2 work really well with z wave sensor and stick with lutron caseta switch,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
a tad more installation work but worth it,5.0,pros connects to the neutral wire connect to switch instead of dangling wire out the back connects to z wave network easily work great cons connecting the neutral is more work but worth it deeper dimension than standard switch overall installation requires a little more work than the older version but it s worth it to avoid the downside they had and these switch work great i ve been using z wave switch for awhile and most of mine were the previous version of ge jasco switch this is definitely a step up here s why the older generation of switch were mainly designed for incandescent light in this system you really didn t need to connect the neutral wire to the switch the switch required a very low constant power supply to operate it s never 100 off this current would pas on to the light and it would take the return path via the light neutral wire the problem is that with cfl and especially led bulb this cause a flickering in dimmer switch when they brighten or dim and can can cause led bulb to glow when the switch is off because just enough current is going through the line to activate them it wasn t enough for incandescent bulb to light up by having a neutral connected to the switch though you don t have these problem since the low current isn t passed on to the light when off i also prefer the switch like this where you attach the wire directly to the switch and screw them tight instead of the type that ha wire hanging out the back i don t have to twist wire together and have wire nut taking up room in the box where i m usually pretty low on space anyway the downside is that you might have some unexpected work to do in the switch box if you start off with standard switch the electrician most likely took all the neutral wire twisted them together and capped them off in the box you ll have to run a jumper wire from the connected neutral over to your switch the box includes a jumper but it may not be long enough for what you need especially if you have a multi gang box and the neutral are twisted together on the opposite side of the box i just took some romex and cut out a length of white wire for the job and a others have noted these switch are a little deeper than normal one and you might have to do some wire cramming in the box to make everything fit as for the z wave i connected it to my smartthings hub with no problem and it work perfectly all in all i like these they re better than the older variety in several different way and they re a good price for z wave switch,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
good product none have failed,5.0,edit i tried to review both the add on switch and the z wave switch but amazon keep lumping them together so here is another go at it first both these do exactly what they are supposed to i have a bunch of the switch and the add on switch and none have failed in the original review i took off a star because because the screw are philips head household switch are supposed to have robertson head screw but really no big deal the add on switch can be a bit hard to hook up at first but they are simple you just need a neutral wire white from anywhere and a traveller non current carrying wire usually red or black back to the main ge z wave switch for the traveller in a rewire one can just use any wire that go between the add on and the z wave switch providing there is no electricity in it the neat thing about the add ons is that one can have several of them all in parallel going back to the ge z wave switch so a single light or bank of light could be controlled from two three or more location providing you have or can install a traveller wire between all the additional add on switch on one re wiring i messed up and inadvertently had power on the traveller i wa sure i d blow the switch or the add on a the instruction are clear that there should be no power on that terminal so my surprise nothing blew up,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

doesn t look the same a it mate,3.0,this add on switch function a it should there s no question about it wiring wa straightforward and simple and it worked immediately and easily to control a hardwired light from a second location i knocked two star off it rating for two separate issue both of which would be an easy fix and grant a great deal more satisfaction with the product both of my negative criticism of this device are because of it design while you might think design is secondary to function it is after all just a switch whose function should be taken for granted a the very purpose of it existence therefore design is key the two issue i have are simple and i imagine would be easily remedied in the manufacturing process the problem is that this standalone switch is built to be compatible strictly with ge s smart dimmer switch ge z wave plus wireless smart lighting control smart switch on off in wall includes white light almond paddles works with amazon alexa 14291 but sadly it doe not match the design or look of the switch it compatible to i m disappointed that at this price point it doesn t appear identically to it mate the first and most obvious is that the ge s smart switch all have a blue led in the bottom right of the switch s frame to help you easily locate the switch in the dark this add on switch doe not have such an led therefore breaking up the continuity of a switch bank i have it installed with two other smart switch and causing a sort of asymmetry the second design flaw likely a result of the omitted led is that the switch frame is not the same width and therefore look like a totally different brand perhaps it would not bother some people but these subtle difference catch my eye from across the room and detract from it overall satisfaction,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works with smartthings no problem so far,4.0,i bought a samsung smartthings hub and have been replacing switch throughout the house i bought this specifically to work with a celing fan with light along with their fan control for some reason no company had a combined fan light control installed in a 2 gang box it work with my smartthings hub seamlessly and if we move it will function a a normal switch for the next homeowner i knocked off 1 star the switch ha captive screw for the wire hookup that are intentionally loose if anyone ha wired up a normal switch the screw will stay put when backed out this make it a little harder to wire up but not impossible,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
no problem with switch dimmer or ceiling fan all were found by vera edge immediately and easy to setup,4.0,alright i really enjoy what these switch do but i am not a fan of installation the back of the item are rather bulky so ramming them back into the box get tough but what is really annoying is that there is either no tension or no spring loading on the screw so if you have to do a class wire wrap instead of inserting into the straight connector you re going to bang your head having to wrestle with the screw to get a wire loop in there other than the install they have all worked well i have dimmer which seem to go in 1 increment via my vera edge i have 8 or so on off switch and recently started using the ceiling fan switch all work really well functionalliy just 1 star for the install maybe the bulk is shielding or something but you would think in this day and age the device could have been a bit le bulky it s almost guaranteed you will want to break off the butterfly wing on both side if you have more than 1 switch per gang i d do that before wiring them in once i had enough of these scattered through the house i wa able to add more zwave device without having to move my vera edge around it is addicting to have these next step will be to incorporate motion sensor into scene,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

details on alarm com finding the neutral wire,5.0,there are two aspect of installing this system 1 configuring your z wave system and 2 basic switch wiring 1 z wave my alarm system includes an alarm com module that act a a z wave controller in advance of buying these light switch i called my alarm company and specifically requested that they enable light lock thermostat etc it did not cost any extra before starting the installation i logged into the alarm com web interface and made sure i saw a message like this your service plan includes light automation but it doesn t look like you have any light device that helped me realize that the system wa ready for the install 2 wiring i installed two z wave switch into a three gang wall plate the two z wave switch now control the exterior light turning them on at sunset i didn t want to bother paying extra to automate an interior light my modern house built in the last few year included three wire already attached to the old switch a copper ground wire a black line hot wire and a black load wire these were simple on and off switch not three way switch tucked away inside the three gang wall plate wa a bundle of white neutral wire inside a screw cap working with the neutral wire wa the hardest part of the installation for a non electrician i went to a big box store and bought 15 foot of romex 14 guage wire for around 7 buck the romex included a black and white wire plus a ground i just wanted two 8 inch length of the white wire i stripped the end of each 8 inch white wire to turn it into a pigtail lead that went to the big bundle of white neutral wire i also bought a larger wire nut at the big box store my non contact voltage tester helped me differentiate the line hot wire from the load wire in my installation both were black but the hot wire is the one that beep when you put a voltage tester near it also it provided some extra peace of mind if you turn off the circuit breaker you re pretty safe but i ran back and forth to the breaker box a bunch of time trying to figure out the wire if i placed the voltage tester near the wire and did not hear any beep i felt more comfortable reaching in there here s the voltage tester on amazon fluke 1ac a1 ii voltalert non contact voltage tester http www amazon com gp product b000ej332o,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works perfectly with dimmer but requires some electrical rewiring in the box,5.0,wiring this accessory switch wa weird because it is the opposite of the way a traditional three way switch is installed you usually have the traveller and the hot going through the switch and the neutral is just connected directly to the load but not this accessory switch it is actually the opposite you still connect the traveller through the switch but this is the neutral that you connect to the switch the hot go straight to the load because of that it mean that you have to identify which of the two switch is the one going to the load before you can replace them the main switch and the accessory are not interchangeable from an electrical point of view tldr if you are replacing an existing switch be ready to have some slight rewiring in the box to do nothing too difficult but need some attention also you have to make sure that you have disconnected the both existing switch before doing the installation or you might send hot into the accessory dimmer and that s not good the documentation is pretty good and easily to follow just make sure to read it before tackling the install,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

annoying to pack into electrical box but work well and appears reliable,4.0,installed pretty easily though a is true with similar product from every vendor i have dealt with it is take up a lot of room in the box meaning you have to cram the wire into a very tight space my guess is that installing two of them into a 2 gang box would be even more painful functionally it ha given u no problem though it took me a couple of go arounds a a user to prove to myself that it wa acting a expected i wish it wa cheaper i wish you could replace just one of the switch and leave the other 3 way or 4 way in place rather than having to buy the add on but so far that hasn t become available with any vendor has worked a documented for 2 week without incident,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

once paired it worked fine about 4 month,3.0,i had a difficult time pairing this switch with my veralite controller i tried various combination of button press and power cycle for about an hour until it finally paired once paired it worked fine about 4 month the thing i dislike the most is that the flange around the switch is very thick this cause it to protrude out of the outlet box further than a standard switch if you have a double gang box with another switch this one will stick out further and the wall plate will no longer fit correctly you ll need to either figure out a way to recess this switch removing about 0 125 of drywall or bring the standard switch forward with some spacers the later option may result in a gap between the back of the wall plate and the wall itself,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

nice tactile feel but,4.0,these work well however there are range limitation even in our little home we need to keep our zwave controller within 40 ft of our switch or they can hang and stutter when commanded also if the distance is over 50 ft or so the status read back from the switch can take three to four time longer to be reported properly there is also a noticeable delay between the time you press the switch and when the light actually come on i perceive it to be around 1 3 of a second delay which is just long enough for you to wonder if you need to press it a second time but they have a nice positive feel the is a perceivable click even to the touch when they are pressed the tactile feedback is very welcome we used x10 switch for year although the x10 switch work reliably they had a very spongy cheap feel but these have a solid qualit feel to them,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

this seems to work fine with the vera controller,4.0,this seems to work fine with the vera controller it s a lot le noisy than the old dimmer that we had controlling the fan knocked off one star due to the size of the plastic on the back of this part it is difficult to get into a multi gang box i could not get alexa to recognize this with my vera lite controller although it recognizes other thing,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works well very poorly constructed for the price,3.0,i bought this from discount home automation a it wa significantly cheaper there am very disappointed with the quality of this switch i m using this with smartthings home automation and here s the plus and minus 1 compatibility 10 10 works perfectly paired out of the box push the switch up to start the pairing process 2 functionality 5 10 for the price it should have other feature which other switch support such a an indicator light which can be programmed via smartthings 3 quality design 2 10 very poor build quality design for the hefty price first of all this is a big switch and take up almost the whole box when using in conjunction with other switch in the same you may run out of space the switch button that stick out is very long much longer than the standard switch it look very odd a long narrowing piece of plastic sticking horizontally out of the plate it s doesn t angle and is perpendicular to the plate it just move 1 mm up down to switch on off also the screw hole for the face plate are poorly constructed a standard size screw didn t fit and got jammed and eventually it snapped off inside the switch while trying to tighten it i expected much better build quality for this price end result it work but i ll switch to another brand a soon other option are available it look very funny sticking out of my face plate link to picture no way to submit http www dropbox com s is55fa4nkvukgbb photo 20feb 2004 2c 209 2024 2015 20am jpg dl 0,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
will not work on 2 wire boxes,1.0,on many older home which only have line and load wire to the box this product will not work for you i m not an electrician so adding ground and neutral line to the box were out of the question i wanted soooo badly for this to work and to get my geek on oh well,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
switch work and pair easily with smartthings,4.0,great switch paired very easily with the hub once it wa within range of it only negative i will say and the reason for 4 star instead of 5 is that while i wa playing with the screw to tighten the grounding wire the screw broke off leaving half in the switch and half that wouldn t screw into anything anymore i managed to push the switch back into the box in a way that pressure wa holding the ground wire in it place but a bit bummed that it broke almost straight out of the box other than that the switch work beautifully and paired with no problem makes a bit of a loud click sound when you turn it on and off via the smartthings app but that is not a serious complaint and is easily overpowered by some background music or conversation will be buying more of these for sure,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
needs a little know how to set up,5.0,i wanted to explain a couple of thing to those who plan on self installing i felt pretty confident having done some electrical work in the past i got a little stuck for a moment on this though it can operate a a regular 2 way switch just fine or 3 way or 4 way if desired someone said it cant do 2 way and thats not true it doe require a neutral i knew that going in my house wa wired with them so i purchased with confidence you can check by opening a switch box and checking to see if you find a bundle of white wire tied together if you do then thats your neutral when you go to install youll find black wire bundled together too those are your power wire or live or hot depending on who you ask when you replace a switch youll see that the hot bundle ha a wire going to your switch and another black wire that run out to the light fitting thats called the load remember which is which now when you go to install the new switch youll need to remember the live and the load and install into the new switch a labelled however youll also need to add a neutral and this is where i went wrong i assumed i should unbundle the white neutral from the load and use it when thing didnt work i realized that wa dumb because now my light had no neutral rather than try to figure out which neutral came from the power side and which one came from the light fitting i just added another piece of white wire from some spare romex and that way i knew it would work when plugged in to the switch so i guess a word of caution that youll need a faceplate use the one designed for the bigger switch they fit perfectly but if installing into a dual gang box if you have fan or other switch you could find it hard to identify the right wire to use so take your time use an extra piece of white wire into the neutral bundle if needed if you dont have neutral wire in your box then youll need to either use a different kind of z wave switch which wont work well with led or cfl bulb or youll need to fish some wire down to the wall with a neutral,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

delay when using switch manually strange functionality,1.0,unfortunately this switch by ge is a total miss the actual mechanical functionality return to a half on half off position after every use which is strange and difficult to use but even more annoying is the delay to turn the light on when manually pressing the switch some delay when using a smart hub is reasonable but when you press the switch manually and the light take 2 3 second to come on it make the entire product not worth the price in my opinion,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
great product,5.0,great product i bought this to turn on off my post light out front of the house with sunrise sunset i am using it with samsung smartthings i hooked it up to existing wiring the switch i had did not have a neutral and they provided a jumper but initially i did not hook it up it did not work no operation at all even on off without the neutral i added that in thinking hit or miss and all worked fine it took a few try to connect it to the hub but all worked fine with a few try and patience i did reset the smartthings hub once but not sure that aided the process overall great product work great and i am a week into not worrying about the light anymore,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

good product a far a z wave goes,4.0,i gave this just four star since it doe work well but is a challenge to pair with the adt pulse system until you have a network of enough of these to make the product realistically programmable the problem with these z wave devices is that you are supposed to have the gateway right next to the switch think about this how realistic is it that you will have your switch int he wall next to the gateway i did get a network of these up and working and they work great but you need a wi fi extender and need to have a population of these to make a large enough web so that they work,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
great regular ui switch for your smarter home,5.0,i had competing goal for my automation project 1 be able to control certain light from outside the house over the internet a well a automating certain process light on upon arrival etc 2 have an a near a possible old school experience for people using the physical switch inside the house this review deal only with the second goal since the first goal is accomplished with the brain of the system the hub smartthings in my case a far a a switch go this is great it work just a expected a a rocker switch except that it is actually a momentary switch meaning that it doe not stay in the position that you put it in but return to it neutral position at all time this is actually great for 3 way application a you always hit the upper paddle to turn it on and the lower one to turn it off unlike with a regular 3 way switch in which the paddle you have to hit depends on the status of the other switch this and the linear brand of switch are the only one i have found that appear to have this configuration and a this is the norm we re all used to this is great since i don t have to explain to my in law how to work the switch in my house the tactile click feedback is perfect it feel just like a regular decora style switch so no one should be confused by it there is almost no delay between hitting the light switch and having the light come on and this is with led bulb which are sometimes finicky to begin with there is a barely audible click of the relay when the switch is triggered either locally or remotely so if you are a light sleeper perhaps don t stick it near your bed if you expect it to be triggered on off remotely while you sleep installation wa a breeze that is assuming you can install a regular light switch it s actually easier to install in a 3 way configuration because you don t need to worry about common terminal just one traveler wire between the two switch installation doe require a neutral not ground wire inside your junction box but it is incredibly rare to have power through light configuration that do not send the neutral down to the switch from the light don t know what you d have to do in one of those case a i haven t run into it yet,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"
works perfectly,5.0,the ge jasco zwave plus line of smart home product show why ge jasco is truly an industry leader this fan switch is an evolutionary product compared to the regular zwave option with improved speed range and processing power the fan switch act like a dimmer holding up or down to go to any of the 3 speed level we couldn t find a way to turn off blue led completely however with a quick google search tapping the on button 3 time then the off button once will do the trick to toggle on when off or off when on it would be great if the zwave command parameter 3 byte 1 value 3 would work but no luck and that s litterly the only thing we found an issue with that being said this is hand down the best option for zwave plus fan switch out there sleek and clean and additional available color in faceplate to match any decore style we tested with wink smarthings and vera and setup and use wa fun and easy see attached photo of how the interface work in samsung smartthings zwave plus is litterly so fast with this product that press on the app would turn on before your figure left the screen an important note this switch cannot control light on a fan like the unreleased zigbee remote and module from hunter bay can however since our fan didn t have light this wa truly a beautiful fit the ge jasco zwave plus line of decora style rocker dimmer and switch blend in to any home or business cleanly and simply we experienced no problem or issue with usability or operation in the below photo we used a lutron claro wall plate for extra clean line and simplicity if you just getting into smart home this is a great start any of the ge jasco zwave plus product or zigbee product work extremely well on all platform and standardize on a non proprietary industry wireless mesh standard works perfectly it s stylish functional and top quality all the way,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

works with fluorescents,5.0,quick review if you re converting your light switch to z wave controlled one but want to use fluorescent bulb this is the answer installation is easy a long a you know a little bit about electrical wiring otherwise it might be a little more difficult for you get them for around 40 here on amazon full review i decided to start switching over my home to use z wave for home automation and needed to find light switch to use around my house after reading some of the review for the dimmer version of this switch i opted to go for these to convert my home i already have fluorescent light bulb for almost every light fixture and being able to dim most of the light wa not a priority for me this product the same a the one included in the 3 way package ge 45614 z wave 3 way on off switch kit which includes an auxiliary switch ge 45610 so that you can have it control a 3 way or 4 way you ll need another aux switch circuit i used these instead of the ge 45606 z wave technology 2 way dimmer switch due to the fact almost every single light in my house is florescent to wire in the switch you need to have ground neutral line hot and load to the light in the electrical box now you should be able to check your wiring and verify you have all the needed wire before tearing everything apart for me all the neutral wire were bound together capped off and shoved to the back of the box i have installed a total of 5 of these now the first one took about 20min the next one went a lot faster and installed in about 10min or le quick hint mark the wire a you take them off the switch check and double check you re hooking up the correct wire to the correct spot on the switch you ll feel stupid having to undo it all when you mix up the line and load wire if you have 2 or more of these installed next to one another you ll need to break off the tab on the side so they can fit close enough together to put the decorative plate over them only break off the one you need to get them to fit for double and triple gang installation i just daisy chained the neutral same with the hot line because it wa just easier than pulling out the whole bundle for me no idea if this follows local wiring code but it s working just fine other thoughts the blue led isn t extremely bright and doesn t bother me by default it is on when the switch if off and off when the switch is on it can help someone unfamiliar with the light switch location to find it in the dark if you have an advanced remote you can switch it so the led is on when the switch is on you can also install the switch upside down and flip it to the correct way using an advanced remote i haven t tested either of these because the default is what i needed i have paired these switch to a couple different type of remote and it ha worked fine with all of them a go control panel one of the basic ge remote and a intermatic ha 07 remote hurray for interoperability you can hear the relay in the switch click when your turn it on and off not really a big deal because my old switch clicked when i flipped them on and off i think you might notice it a lot more if you use the remote to turn the light on and off i ve gotten used to it and barely even notice it anymore these take up a lot more space in the electrical box but i didn t have any issue with not being able to get them to fit properly,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

i wish i could put them in my whole house,4.0,i recently added the ge z wave wireless lighting control switch dimmer to my smart home collection and they have both been a great addition to the system i first got the switch because i wanted to control my outside light every night before i went to bed i would always have to go down and make sure the light were such off most of the time i would forget and they were left on all night now i don t even think about it because they are set up on my smartthings system to automatically come on when the sun set and automatically shut off at a specific time then i got the dimmer switch to control my family room light sometimes when we watch movie we like to have a little bit of light but most of the time we like them off well now we can do both and what make it better is we can speak to alexa and say turn the family room light to 30 or turn the family room light off and we don t have to run over to the switch to do it the connection between smartthings and the echo allow u to use voice command to control them just in case the light get left on through smartthings i have them automatically shut off so they don t get left on i really like the switch and they have been a great addition to my smart home i decided to go with the ge version because 1 they could be mounted on my wall and look like all the other switch that i have in my house 2 they could be used by the smartthings system but i could also manually turn them on and off 3 because they were the cheapest i would love to put these in my whole house but the price isn t where in need to be to get widely adopted i hope that change soon with all the smart home stuff being so new the price point are still a little too high for the value it provides as for the installation it wa fairly easy i did run into some problem with the neutral wire that you need to connect because the instruction were not all that clear on it i watched a couple of the install video that i found online and then i wa able to quickly get them set up and working because the product is bulkier than a normal switch i do have a problem with getting the face plate flush with the wall i either need to adjust the box in the wall so it sits back a little more or find a faceplate that can cover the gap that the switch ha made not a big deal but just a pesky little thing that i think about every time i manually use the switch getting the switched paired to the smartthings system wa simple all you need to do is go the connect new device and they get instantly recognized and let you go through the setup process overall great product and would recommend it for any smart home user,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

be prepared to return,2.0,i have installed numerous switch and outlet over time and this went in just like any other however the reason for a 2 star rating is simple the switch only worked for about 2 minute and then stopped working i tested it during installation and it worked when i put the face plate on and checked it again it didn t work i took the switch out and triple checked my connection and they were all secure i am disappointed because i really did want this to work i wa going to give it a 1 but it possible i got a defective switch however unlikely since it did work at one point the other downside to this brand of switch is that this switch wont work with a dumb switch for a 3 way light not sure why you need the add on switch for it to work properly when there is already a traveler wire going between the switch this switch should be smart enough to know if the dumb switch is in the on or off position the switch itself also ha a slight delay when turning the light on or off,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

can t use manual on off to wireslessly switch a lightbulb using wink hub installation issues,1.0,i wanted to use this wall switch to wirelessly turn on off an led lightbulb located elsewhere in my house without running a lot of wire from the switch to the bulb the command chain should have been push wall switch switch sends signal via z wave to wink hub wink hub sends signal to ge link led bulb to turn on sounds easy right here s the issue the switch doe not send a signal to the wink hub when it is manually turned on or off the documentation doe not make this clear apparently the lutron caseta switch will do this so i m trying this next the second issue is that the wiring of this product without a neutral requires an incandescent bulb to be plugged in at all times what did you read that right yes you did here s why the switch draw a little bit of power if you have an old house like mine power go to your wall outlet then the hot 120 v wire of your outlet run to the switch the old manual switch simply connect and disconnect this hot wire however a new switch like the jasco requires a hot wire and a neutral so that current can flow from hot through the jasco to the neutral and power the z wave function of the switch if there s not neutral where doe the current flow well the people at jasco want the current to flow from the hot through the jasco switch through an incandescent bulb and into neutral probably not the greatest design this is a problem with all switch which require power there are several bad alternative to this wiring scheme so this remains an open problem to be solved,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Duplex Receptacle Outlet, On/Off, In-Wall, White, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12721"

took a little tweaking to set up but work perfectly,5.0,i wa a bit hesitant to spend this much on a smart controller for our pool pump but the old mechanical timer we had wa not working right so it wa worth whatever it took to not have to walk outside twice a day to turn the stupid thing on and off the setup wa fairly straightforward i decided to pair it with a wink hub i can t remember exactly the issue i ran into but i did have some problem that prompted me to first call wink who couldn t help then to call z wave directly they answer the issue customer have in leiu of ge z wave wa able to get me on the right track the only thing i don t like about it which is more of a wink problem i think is that i had to set this switch up a a light since light and switch are on the same interface in the wink app that doesn t make sense to me but alexa still listens when i say turn on the pool pump so whatever i ended up making a wink robot for it to turn on from 4 00pm to 8 00pm and time out after 4 hour anytime for when i run it manually it will turn off in 4 hour those thing work perfectly i m very happy now that it all run smoothly,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

used for sprinkler pump,5.0,honestly i can t speak to the z wave programming much since i use the most basic of aspect on off schedule but so far this wa the easiest one to include in my wink hub 2 first off i m far from an electrical expert i lucked out that the previous electrician labeled the cable in the old timer making swapping out a million time easier now your set up may vary but from the sprinkler pump came 2 cable only for me both are load since it is a 230 v motor this timer handle up to 240 v i m not sure if it matter which is load 1 or load 2 but they attach to terminal 5 and 6 when doing a single pole setup in other word only 1 item is being attached this timer supposedly can handle 2 thing being attached though this is where the one and only issue with this service came up the diagram show load 1 go to terminal 6 and load 2 to terminal 4 the 120 v setup also show the load going to terminal 6 this tell me that terminal 6 is the main load bearing terminal yet the written instruction for 240 v single pole have the load wire connecting in reverse load 1 to terminal 4 and load 2 to terminal 6 this confused me quite a deal but then i thought aren t sprinkler pump dc connection if so then it shouldn t matter which lot go to which since there is no positive note negative polarity long story short i test ran out before screwing the box to the wall and the pump turned on i followed the diagram so proof following diagram for sprinkler pump work the line cable attach to terminal 1 and 2 ground go to the ground screw on bottom center i did find this an odd location since the old mechanical timer ha the ground physically attached to the mechanism part of me doesn t fully believe the timer mechanism of this service is sufficiently grounded based on the design of the old one i m also slightly concerned about a lack of ground to the motor itself this isn t an issue with this item more like i m assuming the previous electrician may have cut it off now if you followed the terminal you ll notice i have used terminal 1 2 4 and 6 terminals 3 and 5 get connected using a jumper cable that isn t included i got lucky that i had some good electrical cable hanging around since we were remodeling if not i d have to buy a spool just for about 4 inch of wire it recommended to use the same type of wire used within wall i believe 16 gauge solid copper for the jumper i had some 16 gauge stranded copper wire but the package clearly state low voltage use only i d say a 240 v application is far from low voltage pairing depends on your z wave setup since i have wink there is no official compatibility for this device wink see it a a light switch i have emailed them a recommendation to add this device a a new category for heavy application either way it wa included faster than any of the other switch i have the day of writing this review wa also the second time the schedule ran i need to be out the door by the second zone being active i woke up to the motor running this is final proof that wink is communicating the schedule to this device and it turn on and off accordingly funny final note i feel this look like a very fat antique cell phone once you attach the antenna,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

works like a champ integrated seamlessly with existing vivint alarm system,5.0,first off this is cheaper than the standard indoor z wave small appliance outlet the only difference beyond the outdoor better seal characteristic is that this unit doesn t have a variable output dimming feature which is fine since we ve never utilized this function once unpackaged i plugged it into an open ac outlet and went to the alarm system control panel and told it i wanted to add a switch as soon a the link button on the module wa pressed the control panel immediately beeped and recognized the new device that wa it the remote outlet wa ready to be moved to it permanent location and because it s recognized by the alarm system it can be controlled and automated like any other device a if it were part of the original setup two of the great selling point of z wave device 1 i haven t found one that is incompatible with our existing network and 2 the z wave network is bidirectional a wireless 802 11a b g n network range is limited by the router s transmission radius but z wave us each component a a repeater the control panel is not a limiting factor because each device can relay communication from any other device a long a one of them in the chain is close enough to link with the control panel for the sake of full disclosure we re not using this outside and cannot attest to how it stand up to the element but since it work so well we may be getting a couple more for some project idea and i ll let you know how they work out if that come to be feel free to submit any question or comment and i ll definitely try to help cheers,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

awesome way to control outdoor lights christmas lights,5.0,i live this thing mated with the samsung smartthings hub now when someone knock on the front door my outdoor light flash to let me know someone is there when i m in the back yard and don t hear the door the distance from the hub scared me because it s probably 75 foot or more from the switch it wa intermittent on getting a signal from the hub until i installed another z wave wall switche nearby which act a a repeater since then it s never missed a signal to turn on or off and response very quickly,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"
great z wave product,5.0,i just got started with home automation and this wa the first device that i purchased to test out if i wanted to invest in more device sure enough i m now hooked pros 1 it ha 2 outlet on the side of the device since the device measure 4 inch wide and 1 1 2 inch deep having the plug on the side of the device minimizes the depth of the device 2 it ha one outlet that is controlled by z wave and a separate outlet on the other side that is always on i e not controlled by z wave this always on outlet mean that you don t lose access to an outlet just because the device is plugged in very cleaver design 3 the device ha a button on the front of the device which is used to a pair the device with a controller and b turn the z wave outlet on off the on off function is handy when you are close to the device and not a controller and want to use the light appliance that is connected to the z wave outlet 4 the device pair well and easily with the ge controller which is very inexpensive through amazon and mi casa verde vera lite controller also available through amazon and other distributor when the device is paired with the vera lite it can be controlled by computer phone tablet etc items to consider i don t want to call these con because these item are not a problem for me but may be a concern to others 1 the device measure about 4 inch wide and 1 1 2 inch deep you should measure your space before purchasing if you think it will be problematic however from what i have read the size of the device help with the z wave mesh network and provides stronger signal boost compared to permanently installed receptacle outlet so the size is actually a benefit to the system 2 there is a noticeable click sound when the z wave outlet is activated on or off the sound is present when the outlet is activated with the button on the front of the device or through an app but it is only present when turning on off the outlet and not at any other time it isn t super loud but it is noticeable kind of like a soft finger snap sound,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

bad range,2.0,i got this to work with my revolv home automation hub and found that it doesn t work well because a the range on z wave device is quite bad and b they work better with mutiple z wave device this is outside on my patio one story and about 10 foot from my insteon hub and only work sporadically 1 out of 10 time at best revolv support say it is a known issue that the exterior wall of your home will diminish the z wave signal a lot based on the way those wall are typically constructed according to a chart included in one of ge s instruction manual the range can be a little a 21 foot if the exterior wall are constructed of brick tile or concrete since you already have a few insteon device in your home and insteon communicates both via radio and through your home s electrical wiring it may be best to pick up one of these for outdoor use insteon 2634 222 on off dual band outdoor module if you d like to stick with z wave device then i recommend adding at least 2 more z wave device to your system so that the signal can be repeated via multiple path to your outdoor module you ll also want to place one of those device within 20 to 30 ft of your outdoor module for best performance also make sure the z wave device are not battery powered or else they won t relay the signal so if you are looking to use this with revolv especially keep all this in mind,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

head to head comparison,4.0,i bought the intermatic ha04c and the ge45604 z wave outdoor module because they were the same price and i needed two to reach the pump i wanted to control my intention wa to use one halfway to relay the signal to the other one controlling the pump the ge unit ha a well built rubber cap that completely protects the outlet when nothing is plugged in if your intention is to leave this unit outside all year when nothing is plugged in then this ge is the hand down best choice the intermatic ha an exposed outlet with no cover the nice feature on the intermatic though is a light to indicate power to the outlet the ge module ha no such indication both module have a button on the face to manually turn the outlet on and off the button on the ge is slightly recessed and and a little harder to press i tested the range on both unit using an extension cord measuring the distance that the z wave signal worked reliably with no retries the intermatic s range wa 64 and the ge s range wa 74 or 90 depending on orientation the ge module range is 16 further if the power cord on the unit is facing the z wave signal source which in my case is a vera lite i also have the aeon labs indoor smart energy switch which i brought outside and established it range wa 95 all three of these switch were very easy to pair with the vera and work well in my home automation application i subtract one star from the ge 45604 otherwise flawless performance due to it not having a light to indicate power to the outlet a power button that is slightly difficult to work manually and concern of rain shorting the circuit while an appliance is plugged into it i have to believe there is a boot that could water proof the outlet when the appliance is in use otherwise the ge work well ha superior range and seal up nicely when nothing is plugged in making it ideal for an outside signal relay at this point i am inclined to stick with ge outdoor module on my future purchase,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

what a great light with easy setup,5.0,this is an awesome way to add a zwave bulb if you just can t figure out the light switch i wasn t going to add a bulb that can potentially die out in a couple of year however this should last quite sometime my tenant is annoying with leaving the light on all night so i added a zwave bulb and connected to vera within 3 minute pretty easy now i can turn it on a dusk and turn it off well whenever i want the bulb come with everything needed they even added a little plastic clip that slide over the switch to keep it from being accident entry turned off manually they truly were thinking when packaging this for the consumer i m thinking of buying more only time will tell if they last 22 yr like it state i don t need full 100 illumination so it should get closed to 10 anything le is a disappointment although these bulb will probably be way cheaper in 10 yr i just don t want to keep shelling out 25 buck every yr for a light this need some kind of hub like vera just in case anyone is wondering if this fails for any reason in the near future i will be sure to update my rating i have not been paid nor do i work for the company that sell or manufacturer this product i take pride in my review and understand that many people use these review in making their buying decision if this ha helped you with that decision in anyway please hit the helpful button thank you very much,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"
varying plug design poor range,2.0,i purchased the ge z wave outdoor plug to control my patio string light via smartthings control unfortunately two factor forced me to return the unit the main deal breaker wa a straight plug v the 90 degree plug a depicted in the amazon product picture the plug wa to be placed in an enclosed outlet box that required a 90 degree prong to fit and allow for closing of the box gotta keep that water out i made sure to check the product picture on amazon to make sure it wa angled which is what the current picture show see my uploaded photo unfortunately there must be two different version of the smart switch with either the straight or 90 degree plug and i got the former since it wouldn t work where i had initially planned i had another spot in my yard for some other light that i decided to try rather than returning the product this is where i encountered the second issue poor range the new location for the switch wa about 40 foot away from my smartthings hub going through two wall the switch wouldn t connect function at that distance i tried it on an outlet about 15 foot closer still outdoors and it picked up just fine so that extra open air distance must be too much for the unit you would think a product intended to be used outdoors would have a strong range but that doesn t seem to be the case i will be checking into the other option for an outdoor smart plug offered through amazon,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"
and you have to track down the controller and software this is more like a ge con,1.0,they do not tell you that to make this work you will have to buy a z wave controller a variety of manufacturer and type work nearly all over 50 then you will have to buy controller software again mostly over 50 then you can use your smartphone or tablet to control your outdoor light so almost 50 switch actually cost near 150 to make it work a advertised and you have to track down the controller and software this is more like a ge con sadly in this case seemingly aided by amazon,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"
good but tricky to initialize,3.0,this work well once i wa able to connect it to my smartthings hub but getting it into a pairing mode wa tricky there is only 1 button but you have to push it just hard and quick enough to turn on pairing push the button wrong and the device doe nothing you may think to yourself how can you push a button wrong i wa there with you and it took me quite a while of trial and error and head scratching before i finally got the first controlled to enter a pairing mode the other 2 were a bit quicker but still took a minute or more to just push the button right and have it turn on and pair it would be better if they kept the manual override button and added a dedicated pen push pairing button,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"
ge z wave wireless controller doesn t live up to it advertising,1.0,i got the ge z wave controller to control light in my office it wa very expensive 100 total for the remote control and the device that plug into an outlet from one side of my office to the other is approximately 25 foot the device is plugged in at a wall which is about 25 from the office door opening if i stand outside the door and attempt to control the light it fails almost 100 of the time and mutiple attempt are required to turn light off or on sometimes i have to walk into the office and stretch my arm out to make it work contrast this with three remote controller i got from home depot for 15 at christmas to control outside christmas light they work just fine no problem at all turning the light on off with any one of them the ge z wave advertises that it can control multiple device at a distance of up to 100 foot in my experience that is a lie originally i thought that i could control my office light from downstairs office is on the second floor that didn t work at all even though the distance wa only about 50 foot max then i thought that i could leave the controller on a shelf outside of the office and turn off everything a i left the office or turn on everything when entering the office that ha not work either i gave it one star for the excessive cost of a device that doesn t work a advertised the cost isn t just the remote control but also the device that plug into the wall socket both were expensive when i found that simple inexpensive christmas light remote control worked fine for 15 of the cost i felt taken by ge a company with a big name that just doesn t live up to it reputation in this case i highly recommend skipping this product and looking for something else,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

nice product but not an angle plug a pictured,4.0,the outdoor z wave timer from ge is a solid product it feel like it is well made and ready to withstand rain snow sleet ice heat and kid i use them to control outdoor lighting like christmas light and deck light i also use them inside since they have a cord v the interior one which plug directly into the outlet i bought it so i could use centralized timing from my smartthings hub and ditch a series of manual digital photoelectric and astrological timer that i had been using my only beef is that the item pictured ha a nema 90 plug on it right angle plug but the item actually doesn t i ve ordered a few of these and none of them are angled all straight not sure what the deal is a everything else look identical having a straight plug is a hassle since it make it challenging to plug it into an outdoor continuous use outlet cover which are required by code for this use case,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"
i got another device using the same technology but not a waterproof and it work fine i enclosed it in a plastic box to,3.0,i wound up returning this because it kept dropping connection it wasn t very far from my zwave controller smart thing but it would constantly drop off the network i got another device using the same technology but not a waterproof and it work fine i enclosed it in a plastic box to prevent any issue i had to bring this right next to the hub to pair it and even with a repeater between it and the main hub which shouldn t have been required it would keep dropping i have other zwave product much further out than this wa and they worked fine don t know if i got a dud or what but i returned and didn t ask for a replacement i got something different that had worked for me before,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"
ge z wave wireless smart lighting control,4.0,picked up this to control a living room table lamp with a switch led bulb using it with the smartthings hub it set up very easy and work pretty well since the bulb is dimmable it is nice to finally be able to use that feature of it using it with the samsung app and alexa it control consistently and dims the light very well my only complaint is a feature of this is to be able to cycle power on the lamp switch itself and have the light turn on instead of using the z wave to control it but that doe not work the feature is disabled by default and you need a controller to enable it which make no sense would be 5 star if not for that but otherwise i am happy with it,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"
good zwave controller for my pool pump but sometimes ha problem with wireless operation,3.0,i am using this product to control my pool pump while connected to my z wave network it is located not far away and almost line of sight from the zwave controller so i know it not the signal strength that cause issue pros solid and waterproof enclosure big button on front for easy manual operation nice indicator light on the front nice terminal and and lot of space for easy wiring cons not reliable operation with zwave network command i send for on of are sometimes not always executed i d say 90 of the time it work perfect by remote but the few time it doe not place doubt so i have to double check now to make sure the pool pump truly turned on at time it is not being able to be seen by the network for no apparent reason,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

not ready for prime time,1.0,with a name brand product like ge i had expected a product with adequately simple setup instruction ease of use and a basic level of customer support i found none of these it came packaged well with a single page instruction sheet three page total but only a page for each language first i bought this to use with the wink hub and on the package it ha the wink app ready symbol so i expected it to work and be supported the wink app doesn t support this product so the easy setup isn t so easy it can be added a a generic zwave switch but the information and feedback from the app on how to do it and when is very limited which is understandable since wink doesn t support it they don t have specific instruction and troubleshooting in the app like they do for setup of most of their supported product generic instruction for generic switch ok however the instruction with the switch are virtually non existent so a supposedly simple setup failed after dozen of attempt long press single press reset the hub etc i asked wink they said to factory reset the switch it should say how in the instruction nope the instruction contain little information about the process of pairing resetting turn out you can t or troubleshooting jasco the maker of the product under contract for ge i guess took 2 day to respond to a support request and then only to say what amounted to it s not our problem talk to wink in the end after 3 day of attempt i wa able to pair it to the wink hub thanks to wink for figuring out someone else s product and helping me make it work this product wa intended to be used to control an automatic chicken coop door on a schedule with the option of manually switching a necessary the push button doesn t feel very sturdy and time will tell but given the overall experience with the company this switch and the interaction with my controller i don t feel it to be a reliable solution so i may ultimately move to a different product in all i would avoid this product in the future given the seeming lack of reliability poor customer service poor instruction lack of troubleshooting and difficulty in pairing update after a couple of week of use after finally successfully pairing the switch intermittently fails to function i don t think the issue is with the wink server a the app show the properly scheduled change of state but the switch hasn t actuated given this is used to control the chicken door to let them out each morning and close them in at night particularly if we are away intermittent failure is not acceptable it may be an issue with distance to hub and environmental condition roughly 30ft through one wall and the low relative power of zigbee v zwave in any case it doesn t meet basic expectation that an automated switch can work reliably automatically i d try troubleshooting but the maker a described above clearly doesn t feel accountable to the end user so i ll be returning it and looking for alternative,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

reminder only 1 of the plug is zwave enabled but it work,5.0,ok product work so that is important connected to wink easy love the offset application when you plug it in so the bottom plug can still be used also having 2 outlet is a great idea the only thing that surprised me wa i expected both outlet on either side of the adapter to be zwave controlled that is not the case only 1 plug is z wave controlled for your lamp and the other outlet is not that is most likely on me probably overlooked it or misread the fact that 1 wa a grounded 3 hole outlet and one wasn t i wanted to control 2 lamp at once that sit on a sofa table and this wa a perfect option so i thought but keep in mind it work perfectly and is represented correctly just if you happen to have the same application that i wa looking for this adapter will only enable 1 side to be zwave controlled i will simply use it on another single lamp and all will be good i am giving it 4 star only because i would like to have an option available from this product where i could control 2 plug at the same time on second thought that really isn t fair to the product or the seller i ll change it to 5 star and look forward to finding an adapter that can control 2 lamp at the same time,"GE Z-Wave Wireless Smart Lighting Control Outdoor Module, On/Off, Plug-In, Black, Works with Amazon Alexa, 12720"

output of 1125 watts see photo with 75 efficiency that work out to a total of 1440 va at the wall plug and 1080 watt for a typical 120 vac house and only 1320 va and 990 watt for a house running on 110 vac maybe they exist but i don t know of any house that is operating at 125 vac hence presuming normal load and source condition it would be more forthright to advertise this device with a maximum output rating of 990 1080 watts at 110 120 vac the cyberpower pr1500 though called a ups by name is in fact not a true ups and uninterrupted this product by electrical design is not a double conversion device and therefore ha a transfer time up to 6 milli second a true ups with double conversion circuitry ac dc ac ha zero transfer time and truly uninterrupted with ac line lost but because of noise level electrical efficiency issue and popular perception cyberpower apc and other manufacture include device such a this under the heading of ups the set up and configuration instruction are incomplete and us very small hard to read type also no hard copy of the manual is supplied the only manual available is one that can be down loaded or obtain from the supplied cdrom not all of my power backup application are near a computer s and to presume so or to disregard other application is a bit near sighted as for tech support twice this week i called the phone number listed on the company web site during normal working hour 1 30pm cst and the phone rang for several minute with no one answering although not mentioned in the instruction the front led display block can be removed and rotated see photo to accommodate horizontal and vertical placement to rotate the led display block one ha to insert a flat tip standard screw driver into a small slot see photo and gently and carefully lift and extract the display block the display block is attached in the rear with a ribbon cable to the face panel so be careful not to extend this part too far somewhat disappointing given today s technology and ease to set but the displayed input voltage is off by 2 vac a per a fluke 187 dvm the on off switch ha a plastic protective flip cover see photo to prevent accidental cycling of the ac source this is a nice hardware feature and one that i feel other manufacture would do well to adopt the unit come with a 10 foot power cord with the ac prong set in a protective plastic sheath see photo batteries were fully charged on arrival as an observation during the power cycle transfer test and yet to be quantified i noticed that the cyberpower pr1500 produce more inverter cooling fan noise and vibration than the combined effect produced by an apc su1400rm2u and su2200rm2u sine wave unit i have protecting an audio system that s because the inverter fan in the cyberpower pr1500 is not a variable speed fan and operates at full speed at all time the inverter is functioning though minor at the rear of the unit the space between the ether cable line out and the ac power cord grommet see photo is too tight even though i have small hand i still found it necessary to use a flat tip device to depress the plastic ether cable release tab to disconnect the ether cable this clearance problem could be alleviated if the chassis designer were to rotated the ether port in their mount by 180 degree placing the ether cable depression release tab opposite to that of the power cord grommet included is a set of rack mount ear see photo pseudo dovetail sliding rail kit see photo and shoe chock see photo for freestanding the steel rail and slide are of the non roller bearing type but still very functional the two supplied plastic shoe for setting up the ups in the vertical orientation can be separated see photo into four separate chock for setting up the device in a horizontal non rack mount placement for a heavy product not having to be flush with the resting surface can be very helpful such that one can get their finger underneath the unit for easer lifting the

excellent but heavy rack mountable ups,4.0,very nice rackmount able ups built in remote access network card a significant value quite heavy around 80 pound you will need the rack mount slider and a helper to install properly in a rack the 2200 unit from the oem is similar in weight and now wish i had purchased it instead if you don t rack mount the unit be careful it s not in a place or location where it might be accidentally tipped over,"CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower"
great ups horrible packaging,3.0,works great more available power than 1500 apc and pure sign wave 2 star for packaging unit is very heavy and box wa torn but didn t look too bad when we opened it the foam wa trashed and the front bezel wa damaged mostly cosmetic unit work fine but we were afraid we wouldn t get the handle to fit they really need to rethink the packaging or require pallet delivery it say team lift on the box but how many team have you seen in a ups truck,"CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower"
solid,5.0,i have owned around 10 battery backup system this one put them all to shame love how this come with the hardware in the box that allows you to setup it up for a rack or on the floor setting on it edge with foot the lcd can rotate to match your install so you can few the setting properly i also picked up the cyberpower rmcard202 remote management card this will allow me to remote in form anywhere and reset my network if need be wished the card came with the unit but for how this ups is priced it a great deal and value and the extra 130 still make this one of the best deal loved using my prime to get free shipping on a heavy ups though they don t allow two day on this i have 5 dell powerconnect 24 port switch a 5 drive nas comcast and dsl modems a router a firewall and a cisco aoronet access point this unit will provide over an hour of battery power for all of those device allowing our office generator to kick on and take over at that point in reality i only need 10 15 min also is the largest unit you can use on a 15 amp plug ordering 2 more soon to replace the single unit powering my different server,"CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower"
big ups of awesome sauce,5.0,i maintain a small rack of gear along with my workstation and wa getting tired of the limitation the smaller ups unit have wattage wise this thing is able to handle everything i throw at it without choking we had a few power interruption recently and the unit didn t even blink it screamed like a bloody demon when doing it thing but that is to be expected the best part about these is the direct expansion path provided by the extension battery tray well worth the price,"CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower"
defective unit,1.0,received my pr1500lcdrtxl2u and it s defective when i plug it into ac power and turn it on i get a quick beep and a long beep the ups stay on for a few minute in those minute i determined that the ups wa incorrectly detecting an under voltage condition here s a paste from the powerpanel page input status under voltage voltage 76 0 v frequency 60 10 hz model pr1500lcdrtxl2u firmware version 4 3 5 ups type sinewave line interactive power rating 1500 va 1500 w current rating 12 0 amp voltage rating 120 v frequency rating 47 53 57 63 hz just for fun i tried several outlet including my washing machine outlet which is on it own 30a circuit same result obviously if my electrical service wa only providing 76v a indicated by the ups status nothing would be working in my apartment but this isn t the case the ups is wrong just to verify this i measured the voltage with my multimeter see picture i put in a support request with cyberpower with all the detail but so far haven t heard back from them i m hoping that it can be repaired and that i won t have to return it since the thing and accessory in it box is 90lbs and would be a big pain to haul down to a shipping facility awaiting response from cyberpower note that the picture show the multimeter plugged into a power strip which i used just for convenience the ups wa plugged directly into a wall socket,"CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower"
don t buy it,1.0,cyberpower pr1500lcdrtxl2u i bought this item and installed on oct 1 2010 for my home entertainment system the item we had connected to the critical outlet were the hd television dishnetwork receiver and a yamaha receiver the hd tv ha a fan that run on the bulb for 2 minute after it is shut off sony to cool it down and if the power is disconnect from the dishnetwork receiver it go through a reboot program that last from a few minute to 10 minute even if the power go off for a second so if your watching tv and there is a power loss you are going to miss a large part or if you are recording you will lose everything after the power go off even for a split second first i would like to say this item appears to work a described when the power went off or we had a brown out it would kick right in but i don t see how anyone could watch television or listen to music with the sound level of the cooling fan my wife ha an 1800 watt hair dryer that make le noise this cyberpower system is really loud we would turn it off or leave the room when it came on ok here is the really bad part like another user giving a review here this unit kicked on last monday morning at 3 am the loud fans and beeping woke me up so i went in the living room and turned it off the next morning i tried to turn it on with no luck i left it plugged in with nothing on for about 10 hour and tried to turn it on again with no luck i took the top cover off and checked the voltage to the circuit board and it wa 120 volt i pulled the battery pack out and checked voltage of all 4 battery i disconnected battery one at a time while checking and each battery had 13 4 volt fully charged i checked the switch and it wa ok from these test and others i did indicates a bad circuit board i called tech support at cyberpower and the first thing the guy said wa the battery are bad after i explained that i had checked the battery and what the result wa he basically said i have a 600 00 paper weight so i called back today and got a different guy with the same result i ask if i could buy the circuit board from them or somewhere else and he said no every thing check out good but the small 6 x 6 circuit board i think this is the worst review i have posted at amazon i would not buy again my background i use to teach a specialized electronics class for general motors i have worked on computer since 1992 i have installed a partial solar system at my home used to charge our home phone system cell phone rechargeable aa aaa battery and every other item that is rechargeable it also basically run out video security system too one other thing all the review posted here about this cyberpower pr1500lcdrtxl2u are not for this model number so look carefully at the model number,"CyberPower PR3000LCDRTXL2U Smart App Sinewave UPS System, 3000VA/3000W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack/Tower"

excellent ups and a value price point in it class with benefit of safe modular enclosure fan noise beep requires wire snip,5.0,bought this in sep 2013 it is now dec 2013 we just had an ice storm a lot of power fluctuation and today we had a second outage for about an hour and forty minute last night i operated this from the simple software downloadable from the cyberpower site onto my windows 7 laptop i put the unit into a test mode i have one ebm hooked up i have disabled the alarm from the s w you cannot do it from the front panel a i had hoped however there is still an alarm that go beep beep every few minute while the fan whir the trade off is you do have real power last night i had to abort the test it indicated i had 10 hour and 52 minute of runtime the load wa about 80 watt this includes a robust desk set up with most appliance off just like i would do in an outage however i left the laptop powered up after hour of the annoying beep which i probably will open the unit and snip the wire in time to get rid of that sound i recommend that anyone not familiar with electricity not to fool around inside these unit there is high voltage and current present and i am sure you could get injured if you do not know what you are doing never open it with it plugged into the wall and know that if you intend to do what i am contemplating that you cannot touch capacitor etc and should have one hand behind your back and likely use an insulating glove for electrical work goggles are also recommended even sealed lead acid batteries may leak some acid or hydrogen i do not endorse fooling around inside the unit i am a ee and may do this however but the noise is mostly annoying to the woman i share the house with when i first hooked it up i put the hp 4 laserjet hog on it honestly it wa within specification but i thought momentary peak current draw would cause a problem nothing ran fine without a glitch they do tell you not to hook laser printer up but i am going to tell you that there is a good chance you could be fine the main reason not to do it is that you are going to burn through your run time now i decided to get greedy and see what would happen if i connected the microwave to it we did have power out the microwave started clearly power starved struggled and the cyberpower ups unit took itself offline obviously due to an overload condition the microwave draw 1500 watts and sure it would have been gravy if that actually ran it did not and that is within spec you are not supposed to use motor with these however i have a work around i am going to experiment with and will let you know there is a box intended for audio video and live performance it is the most economical box that furman sell that doe power factor correction which is impedance matching to maximize power transfer to the equipment from the wall socket i intend to put this between the output of this type of unit and momentary high current peak power draw device the unit is call the furman p 1800 and run about 400 usd or le now on amazon i have one on order the unit benefit is in it instantaneous current resorvoir internal capacitor to in this application prevent surge from overloading the cyber power ups unit by responding to these instantaneous current draw with capcitative stored energy it will not take care of an rms overload condition in other word this will not solve connecting a microwave to this but you are not supposed to connect a microwave or a refrigerator to even the unit that is above this i e the cyberpower pr2200lcdrtxl2u smart app sinewave ups 2150va 1650w snmp http rack tower i mention all of this because i am going to explore that next i am looking to build up another stronger batter ups for some kitchen appliance with the current draw supply circuit of the p 1800 in between right now this is a future experiment i will try to write later to see if that work out but if you don t mind protecting this unit it can be used for this also and while the p 1800 ha not arrived yet it is likely that you could used this with an amplifier to at least bring the sound in to a range of normal the jury is out it is a big complaint for a v type folk that using ups kill the sound because of the need for this instantaneous current i am proposing a possible solution i am exploring back to this unit and my home office this exceeded my expectation runs like a champ i do a lot of telework and i am never going to be off line even if this dropped off the laptop have battery in them and i have a small cyberpower 1500 pflcd whose only purpose in life is to back up the router 5 watts so when the ups dy which would take considerable time beyond a work day everything is still humming power grids are becoming increasingly unreliable i made the decision to go big or bigger on an ups based on a situation of being at home and working and simply not being able to afford to have down time during a work day in addition i realized that in spite of the fact that the refrigerator will keep your food cold for hour if you leave it closed that is not much use to me if i am in the middle of an outage and need to eat to keep going that is the motivation for getting the 2200 with a 15 amp adapter cord make sure you know the total max draw including charging if you pursue this i mention above i will be ordering that soon i just ordered two more ebms the one i ordered with this did show up with a brown exotic spider living inside of it it looked poisonous and wa rather large i am a wimp and i killed it so just be advised when you open these that they are shipped from somewhere don t ask me where somewhere is found the desert no idea the office set up is in a bed room and others have mentioned that the blue led engaged unit light is bright and always on it is true unless you sleep with light on it is going to annoy you just do what someone on here did and put a piece of tape over it to dull it with a piece of paper over the light portion do not get to carried away you may need to access the switch the ups can be turned off this will cut the power to everything hooked up but if it is the middle of the night the whirring fan and the beeping could ruin your relationship or alienate your pet you doubtfully will be getting any sleep this will turn off the blue on led light also now if your power is intermittent all the time you are going to need to think about the above and get realistic the ups can be placed in a closet and it ha excellent vertical bracing support bracket you can save money on the cost of a fancy rack and simply place it in a vertical position these vertical bracket are like book end that snap into place underneath they are made of reasonably sturdy plastic also each extra ebm will come with two plastic extenders that allow these footer type bracket to be expanded so that you can sandwich them in tightly like book end they snap into place lock and are secure ups ebm s in an upright position together i suggest you consider a solution some a v installers do where they put this kind of unit concealed in an actual closet you like me are going to have to consider how and where you will route cord without creating a dangerous kludge not only to avoid electrocution but imagine what the fire marshall might say if you have wire strung around your house not to code and you have a fire that could be a liability issue also all module have fan the fan are located on each far side of the ebms thus in the vertical position that would mean you can find them on the top and bottom every additional fan is going to add 3db more noise referenced to a single fan so yes every time you add an ebm the baseline of two fan is going to increase the noise by 3db referenced to each unit ebm thus you can add the dbs to the basic unit to plan ahead and calculate the loudness of the unit or i can just tell you it will sound like you are in a server room take your pick some noise and reliable power or no noise and no power the solution for the kitchen if i do it and i probably will will wrap into a close on the floor at the base with the sound beep one lead pulled off after opening and safely terminated in insulation to prevent conduction to any surface inside the unit if i ever were to sell the unit i would reconnect the wire we are talking about a single internal speaker wire removal here if this plan doe not work i will then flow the equipment to an audio system or first try it on a freezer another pending purchase the freezer is le likely you just leave them shut many of the people posting here are telling you about multiple system around their house yes the cost doe add up since again unless you have constant power problem we are generally talking about occasional outage this is where you ass your extension cord situation in an ice storm for instance a bright extension cord that is 50 or 100 and appropriately rated for the power it will carry to match or exceed your ups can be a valuable cost saving measure to get power around the house on a temporary basis during a short storm there are advantage to having the stand alone system people are describing no or few extension cord local power station type set up this is all very valuable one for your office and after tested and i can confirm it probably within the next six month something for some very basic but moderately extended outage also know that these modular battery back ups are a superior solution to big car battery and inverter with dangerous wire strung about to cobble together a diy solution i contemplated doing that instead because you can pick everything you want the inverter the batteries etc but in the end this wa the safest and most eloquent solution it wa not the least expensive that said these are very reasonably priced for what you get oversize if you are considering doing this you need to oversize and read the run time chart based on your load if you do not know the total wattage you need it is time to get out a piece of paper and a pen and start looking on the back of your appliance and adding it up another and better way to do this is to use a kill o watt 4460 type meter also something you can find here on amazon and to use the office example buy a nice solid tripplite pdu i recommend the pdumh15 these are here on amazon and are like a safe extension cord with many outlet if you have the money for a rack system then you are going to be able to mount them in a rack otherwise plug the kill o watt meter into the wall then plug your chosen pdu into it then plug your office led lighting into it and your laptop s your printer everything and start to see how all of this add up and what you can unplug if you can afford it i use two pdus in the office one prior to the ups this ha the laser printer photo copier hog connected to it and anything else that i could care a le about taking care of in a power outage then take your other pdu and put this after the ups now connect everything to this you wish to be ups protected your critical stuff if you do not have money for the pdus then work with the outlet on the back of the unit there are two bank one is for critical equipment and the other is for non critical and at a set time which i believe is software configurable those outlet will drop off to conserve runtime in a true power emergency i recommend you are more involved you do not know when the power will be back so only run your critical stuff and a needed turn the hog on the one you have tested to assure that they will not cause your ups to shut off until you reboot it with these no longer connected the software is a little kludegy if your laptop go to sleep the ups loses the bead on the communication with your laptop or stand alone computer and when you wake the computer back up you will be greeted with a couple of message telling you the obvious the connection wa lost it is obviously down your computer is sleeping not processing update12 13 2013 today during another real outage the message will show up on the scree that the upss is on rather obvious it is loud and beeping later when the ups shuts off and power is restored you will get another message to that effect the beep is annoying but these are really serious server ups for a professional environment that mean in a true mission critical operation like a workplace your it network team is going to be manning the situation and want to know about what unit have activated the unit monitor and report their internal operating temperature and run cool in my application the waste heat around 100 watts is very minimal should you buy this well these are a big step up you are buying this because you are serious you are not fooling around with power outages whether you are a small company a large organization or a modest person with a home office and realize that this is an investment in your valuable time if you rely on energy power like i do then this come highly recommended it is the solution for it range it is a value in that range yes you can build whole generator your money is the limit but this is the step you take if you are getting out of dinky ups that damage your equipment and do not do much but give you enough time to shut down smoothly those are valuable and that is what i had until now but imho this is what you step up to a the next level let s say you live in a condo and you have not back up generator for the building then these are really good to keep you up an running if you work at home ever now i can lose power all day and keep working frankly that is amazing and this recent ice storm is what it took for me to know it wa now time to order two more ebms i buy and build a i go unless you are gushing with money or have a specific preplanned application thought through just buy this unit then order the ebms for some people even the basic unit can be enough the first ebm will really take you to a whole other level of back up also strategize to maximize your run time during an outage to keep the load just to what you need also a mentioned these are not built to run reactive load like motor it is possible that inserting the p1800 in between might just allow you to do this it will present a big power draw a more of a steady rms draw looking back at the ups but you will be using up your run time these are not intended for hospital or safety of life do not buy this to back up medical equipment you may have at home or in a doctor s office i highly recommend these unit you can also buy a small honda or some other generator from amazon home depot or your local hardware store and set that outside and run a cord directly to supply power to your ups during a snowstorm and at least have power if you care to around the clock the ups take on the duty when the generator is not running and vice versa i live in a small house and will possibly store a small amount of diesel in the laundry room in the proper container for a small protable diesel generator in a more distant future to back up the ups do not buy an ups to run heater you need a different plan look into propane kerosine and other solution and make sure you always crack a window iaw direction and place these on a safe surface and install batter backed up carbon monoxide detector if these alarm that mean you need to leave the house so keep the air moving be safe our power and weather are not what they use to be cheers it is my hope that this information ha been helpful to all of you in considering this leap good luck,"CyberPower

it all work very well and is very reliable,5.0,i m in the process of moving from 18 x 10 node to an insteon system all of the insteon gear is absolutely reliable it take a little time to get used the process of creating and scheduling scene the instruction could be a little more user friendly and there are some capability which may be missing for example a device switching off on off and dimming brightening during one 24 hour period also there cannot be more than one scene which us sunset and or sunrise for scheduling time note that i may be having these issue because i ve spent over 15 year with x 10 as the hub is ota upgradable and smartphone app is too the chance are these feature will be enhanced over time so far these are nit for me and overall i am very optimistic about insteon,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"

great product but couldn t properly pair to 2 motion sensor a originally intended,4.0,i love this product work exactly a described with no problem and easy setup i initially bought it for my christmas tree light i wanted to have it paired to two motion sensor one at my front entrance and one at the back so that entering the house by either door would turn on the light while it wa capable of pairing to both motion sensor the switch wouldn t work consistently sometimes it worked fine and either motion sensor could trigger light on sometimes only 1 would work and sometimes none would work but when paired to 1 motion sensor the system worked flawlessly i am not sure whether it wa this product or the insteon motion sensor causing the conflict i also did have problem when trying to unpair one of my motion sensor to this module the method to unpair a described in the manual didn t seem to work the easiest solution for me wa simply to factory reset the whole module overally great product i have recommended to friend and family already,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"

great replacement for the x10 equipment,5.0,i have been having great luck with the insteon stuff i have been transitioning from x10 with a lot of success so far i have put in 5 wall dimmer 3 plug in dimmer 1 on off plug in module and one 1 on off wall switch wired to a relay for a 220 application and all are working perfect i bought the 2242 hub which can only be used with a smart device app the sunset sunrise option is a actually linked to the timeline you use which mean it is dark when the light come on if you use that option i used a different time zone to get light to come on a little earlier with the scene i just have to remember the difference when programming light by time the scene through the app are not that difficult to set up once you get the hang of it it doe not give you the security option of varying the on time so i am going to go with the usb hub and see if that work better the not so good with led s being controlled through the wall switch they tend to flicker slightly when on really low intensity and the hub is querying the light when the app try to connect this happens during slow connection now the real bad if you lose internet connection you completely lose access to the 2242 hub even under local wi fi this is such a basic level flaw that i consider a fatal flaw hence the reason for going to a usb hub so for the insteon switch and response 5 star because it all work and communicates great if i were rating the entire system with the current hub 3 star,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"

happy with these device work much better than x10,5.0,i have been having great luck with the insteon stuff i have been transitioning from x10 with a lot of success so far i have put in 5 wall dimmer 3 plug in dimmer 1 on off plug in module and one 1 on off wall switch wired to a relay for a 220 application and all are working perfect i bought the 2242 hub which can only be used with a smart device app the sunset sunrise option is a actually linked to the timeline you use which mean it is dark when the light come on if you use that option i used a different time zone to get light to come on a little earlier with the scene i just have to remember the difference when programming light by time the scene through the app are not that difficult to set up once you get the hang of it it doe not give you the security option of varying the on time so i am going to go with the usb hub and see if that work better the not so good with led s being controlled through the wall switch they tend to flicker slightly when on really low intensity and the hub is querying the light when the app try to connect this happens during slow connection now the real bad if you lose internet connection you completely lose access to the 2242 hub even under local wi fi this is such a basic level flaw that i consider a fatal flaw hence the reason for going to a usb hub so for the insteon switch and response 5 star because it all work and communicates great if i were rating the entire system with the current hub 3 star,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"

buyer beware of warranty issue,5.0,this is a great product and easy to use however this item typically come with a 2 year manufacturer s warranty smarthome com and they are usually very good about replacing failed item so when my 8 month old device sold by amazon and not smarthome through amazon failed i called smarthome they would not honor the warranty because they did not sell it to me directly i wa directed back to amazon and of course the standard return policy wouldn t cover the item after 8 month fortunately for me amazon customer service stepped up and helped me out lesson learned buy from the manufacturer s website or through their amazon storefront if you want to make sure you get full benefit of the manufacturer s warranty policy if they don t have a way to register purchase made elsewhere,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"

adequate be prepared to return one,3.0,the device when it work work a described programming is improved over the previous generation after the initial pairing with a controller like the insteon hub it scene membership can be adjusted without having to press the set button which cut legwork performance is fine it mostly work with dimmable leds with the normal led gap between off and about 10 doesn t seem to make any singing noise when dimming receives command more often than not dual band is a real improvement over wireline only the onboard button are a courteous design gesture the unit is smaller than the previous generation but it lack the pas through plug which mean you ll be shopping for outlet strip with orthogonal plug the packing material is minimal and convenient except the the unit itself is wrapped in clear tape to protect it finish removing the tape is the clumsiest and slowest part of unpacking and installing the device in short a user who is already invested somewhat in insteon will find this unit to be more of the same someone who doesn t already have other insteon device should be sure to consider alternative while insteon work well enough and is easy enough to use and to maintain the device are prone to failure it s a strong effort from the designer and engineer but the factory seems to let unit out the door that barely pas testing compounding the frustration of losing a failed device is the requirement that you factory reset all the controller that were paired to it there is no other way to unlink a device if it isn t working the control network is also somewhat fiddly the design is reasonable and it s impressive that it work at all but in practice in a typical house signal are often lost so these thing are fine for a few room they make for a nice to have just be prepared to send one or two back eventually,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it seems to work fine,3.0,all this insteon stuff is silly expensive but it doe work pretty well i hope it all last because if it dy out of warranty i ll be one unhappy camper,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
very neat but pricey,4.0,i have a switch in the master bedroom that only control a useless outlet but i wanted to control the nightstand light so i bought one of these and a togglelinc dimmer i wired the useless outlet live all the time and replaced the switch with the togglelinc i plugged the lamp into this lamplinc and it work great added benefit the togglelinc ha an led that lead me to the switch in the dark the lamplinc ha up down button so i don t have to get out of bed to turn the light off or on or dim i can t reach the outlet from the bed so i plugged this and the lamp in an extension cord and placed it near the bed there is a red green led in the lamplinc to stear me to the switch in the dark the lamp can be dimmed for romantic atmosphere and when you turn it on or off it ramp up down so it doesn t shock the system with a rapid light change it s quiet no loud click like my old x10 control a little pricey but i ve been using insteon for year without any issue well the wall switch dimmer died last year it wa 3 year old and the lamp module just died it wa also 3 year old i opened each and found burnt component figures they have a 2 year warranty so between the 2 unit it costing me about 30 a year to control my bedroom light,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great for outdoor device control just not for the long term,4.0,these are great for controlling outdoor plug in item two nit 1 these have a tendency to fail after three or four year and you will be replacing them so be prepared to do so in the future i have about 4 of these outside that i bought when i built this house four year ago two have failed after about three year and have been replaced since they re outside and subject to weather i guess that s not bad but i do think they should last longer 2 the most recent one had it address sticker the one that ha the insteon xx xx xx address on it on the top of the device so it s very likely to get bleached by the sun or washed away by the rain it would likely be better on the bottom where you plug in your device that is to be controlled since that part face the ground and is protected from weather and the sun,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
updated version no longer x10 compatible,2.0,i have a few of these around the house and i bought this to replace an older unit that quit working unfortunately this module is a newer version that no longer support x10 signal i have already quit using insteon controller because they are so flaky it seems home automation is still just a few year away form being ready for prime time maybe a few year further than it wa a few year ago the most important thing for home automation is that it is compatible with multiple system and protocol releasing an updated device with le compatibility is just dumb it might do what it wa intended to do but won t do anything for me,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
homekit support very disappointing,2.0,i have to say that insteon ha been really behind and disappointing when it come to homekit support which is really the only reason i bought it it took them a year to update their app from ios 9 to ios 10 in the built in home app on the iphone their product all say no response until you hit the button several time i have emailed their support and they say they are working on it but it take many month for them to update anything unfortunately i had purchased a lot of their product and i just feel like they are not up to the task of dealing with apple homekit update in a timely manor i have other product that use homekit like philips hue and their update work within the first week or so of an update pretty disappointed,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good product design lousy post purchase support,1.0,the design of the insteon system with this on off outdoor plug in module is very good and when it work it work really well i employ two of these module one to control a garden fountain and the other to control the fountain light after connecting them to an inston hub via wifi turning either one on or off is simply a matter of opening the insteon app on my iphone and pressing an on off button so what s the problem here well both on off module have failed le than two year after purchase there is a two year warranty but the manufacturer ha denied warranty coverage on the ground that the device failed due to power fluctuation these insteon people are really something they evidently have the gift of sight to be able to come to that conclusion without even examining the device insteon outdoor smart plug on off works with amazon alexa i am disappointed with their post purchase behavior a i had expected that they would stand behind their product rather than invent reason not to without any examination of the failed product,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
led bulb glow when device turned off,2.0,these device provide a very small amount of power when turned off reading through various web search i thought it had something to do with the built in load sensing however there is a way to turn load sensing off which i did however the device still provide a very small amount of power in an off state as a result my led bulb glow in the past when i wa using incandescent light bulb this wa never a problem but led bulb have been around long enough to where there really is no excuse for these device to peform so poorly until insteon decides to listen to it customer and make a dimmable lamplinc product that turn the load completely off i m done spending any more money on this technology,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
be aware these will not link to the older 2440,1.0,be aware these will not link to the older 2440 hand held remote when i called insteon tech support they said it should and didn t know why it wouldn t several people with the 2440 remote have had this problem the newer mini remote which will work are just too small and limited for me,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
can t get sunrise sunset setting to work,3.0,it pretty much doe what s expected i have it tied to amazon alexa and can use voice control to turn an outdoor device on and off or i can use the app on my phone to do the same and it work flawlessly the only hiccup is that the insteon setting for turning on and off at dusk and dawn do not work at all i don t know if that s a problem with the hub or the smart plug though also it s a little expensive for what it doe,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
will not work with homekit,1.0,i bought the insteon hub for homekit it work great with my insteon wall switch however the smart plug is not smart enough to be controlled by the insteon hub for homekit in all my research i never found any documentation that these will no work with homekit so if you want to use this smart plug with homekit don t bother you will have to return them,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
poorly documented and difficult to set up,2.0,i purchased this because i needed an outdoor rated smart plug after a good deal of struggle i got it to work the manual aren t clear and in some case are incorrect the contrast with the tp link that i bought for indoor use is incredible that worked within 10 minute the insteon took fiddling around for about a week,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i liked it so much i installed it in my kid,3.0,i have been an insteon fan for over 10 year i liked it so much i installed it in my kid house i hate to see the direction and quality that insteon ha taken over the past 3 year they dropped support for the houselinc pc product that made assembly of a whole house system quick and easy their product quality is not where it wa 5 year ago i have had to replace ten unit in the past three year the product i am reviewing the on off module failed after 6 month the competition is fierce for home automation it is such a shame to see insteon throw away such a market leading position with all their clever development for such short sightedness,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
terrible support poor product life complex installation,2.0,terrible customer service he wa trying to explain how a regular switch on a different circuit that ha nothing to do with my 2 lamp module or my insteon hub can become linked to the insteon system these randomly turn on at any time i have only 2 lamp module nothing else on the hub i wa trying to understand what he wa talking about then he hung up and the place is now closed so i will be returning my 2 insteon module and my hub that i received today and i will cancel the order for my echo after deleting all my scene and my device and deleting my account and doing factory reset on the 2 lamp modules and my hub many time nothing ha changed i have followed the procedure exactly for doing factory reset i followed all the step on both lamp module i have simply plugged them in to the lamp and manually turned them off with the dimmer after a few minute the light turn on no account ha been created the hub is not plugged in and the other lamp module is not plugged in still the light turn on by itself this happens with both lamp module maybe both are defective this is a simple lamp with a cree dimmable bulb it ha been used for year with a corded dimmer from leviton with no problem at all it is my fault now for continuing to spend time and energy it look like i have solved the problem this answer to my problem is not documented anywhere i searched and searched the answer is that load sensing is the default and it doe not work it wa the cause of the random turn on problem again the problem occurred with both module call support if you want to learn how it is supposed to work if you are having problem tech support is a waste of time but most of all if your lamp module are turning on randomly disable load sensing the instruction for doing this are in the provided instruction these dimmer with load sensing disabled actually work better than the leviton one they are replacing i can set the led bulb to 10 percent with no flicker edit many many month later still this product ha functioned perfectly the hub and my echo dot are not a reliable but seem to get better a the update come i am so happy to have my insteon system and my 3 echo dots 2nd edit complete failure i m switching to the z wave standard,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
convenient but quality control could be better along with no question asked return policy for manufacturing defect,3.0,i don t know if this is a problem for all insteon 2457d2 lamplinc insteon plug in lamp dimmer module dual band 2 pin device but my personal use wa for a remote switch for an led light string installed well out of routine reach to the electrical outlet powering the device and attached lighting i happened to notice on a particularly dark night that even though the light were switched off the 2457d2 wa obviously delivering low voltage current to the led light my advice since according to seller it wa too late to return the device is to plug the device into an outlet immediately upon receipt and use a tester to detect any electricity leaking through the device when turn in the off position if you get any voltage at any amperage above that of ambient or free space reading return the device on a final note programming instruction for this device are not entirely clear and they are presented in such small print that you may find reading the instruction and implementing them to be a challenge you ll eventually figure it out but you shouldn t have to do so,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the small power leakage build up over time and every few second the led will flicker powering quickly on and off like a flash,1.0,these device will not work with led bulb led string light or any low wattage consumption leds in general what end up happening is that even when commanded to switch off there is still some power leakage through this device to anything plugged in in this case when a low wattage consumption led is plugged in the small power leakage build up over time and every few second the led will flicker powering quickly on and off like a flash and continue going through this cycle indefinitely there is a serious hardware engineering design flaw with these device in general throughout the entire insteon product line that involve on off and dimmer module regardless whether they are micro module full size outdoor etc i would stay away from insteon in general if you plan to use them with low wattage led bulds under 50w load,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
be aware that this is for high voltage stuff and,4.0,be aware that this is for high voltage stuff and not needed for lamps get the dimmer model for those this is for tvs stereo ect you could fry stuff with a dimmer on a product that needs full power this is the safe one,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
their prior model of this module could detect when you,3.0,their prior model of this module could detect when you cycled the power on the device itself if you toggled the on off switch on your appliance a couple of time the module would figure it out and turn itself on this module doesn t do that i bought this to replace a module that failed after a few year of use and i ve had about a 10 15 failure rate with their product so be prepared,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good for switching high load indoors too,4.0,i bought this device specifically to control an older air conditioner with the insteon system the appliancelincs offered by smarthome insteon aren t able to handle the load they have a 500 watt restriction for inductive load such a motor but this component filled the need it get a bit hot during operation but work well i m using this with the insteon wireless temperature control device which doe a good job powering on the ac when needed,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
perhaps it s just a defective unit,2.0,in most respect this unit work a one might expect however there is definitely problem i ve got led rope light plugged into the socket even when the unit is turned off somehow some power continues to flow to the load because the leds glow faintly the whole idea of this unit wa to free me from having to climb a ladder to manually plug the light into the outlet unless i m willing to burn a small amount of electricity constantly consumed by power leaking to the load this flaw ha defeated it purpose i will be contacting amazon and the vendor for a replacement and perhaps my outcome will be better if you order this unit it would be worth your time to test it in a very dark room with an led nightlight or an meter to check it because they are obviously not testing it sufficiently at the factory,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"

directional plug is a pain,2.0,the unit is a minor improvement from the appliance module it can handle small load although the construction is much more flimsy than the appliance module my biggest complaint is that the ground pin go the opposite direction of the wall wart i need to control it s a 50 50 shot and all but they picked wrong for the one device i wa wanting to use it on non polarized plug are much easier to deal with in a perfect world the unit would have a swivel on both the wall plug and the unit s controlled socket but it isn t worth any extra money to be sure for people trying to decide on which type of control system to go for there are a lot of limitation with insteon each system ha it own pro and con and a of january 2014 thing sure don t seem to be well resolved the cost really go up a you add a controller modem and the control device,"Insteon Outdoor Smart Plug, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo outlet a good thing,5.0,ordered the wemo smart plug on 16 apr 16 prime shipping 32 99 2 23 tax installed it in minute when it arrived it s been in use for over 5 month at the time of this review 19sep16 overview i use this and several other wemo device with my echo aka alexa which mean i only use this device locally i don t have any application where i count on this device to respond to me when i m abroad this wemo outlet work flawlessly when house power is stable see below i have other wemo device that i have programmed on off time of day my personal application of this switch doe not require any daily routine to be programmed my only interaction with this device is voice command e g alexa turn tv off the outlet control the power to the tv there are time when the tv ha been left on and the remote is not within eyesight walking through the room i can simply command alexa to turn off the tv and walah for a one time expense of 40 buck i have solved the family conflict of where s the remote and the button on the new tvs are too stealthy for me the pro s part of the wemo family wemo s simple but stable cloud programming allows me to set up time of day to turn my device on or off times of day can be absolute e g 11 00 pm turn off or can be relative e g turn off 30 min after sunset really if you aren t familiar with wemo power in your home read up or just buy a single device to test it out simple home automation done affordably well the con s large protrusion from the outlet bulky on the wall as you can see i gave it 5 star because i don t care about the bulky protrusion but this feature still exists doesn t always recover from a power outage a power outage can be hard on device since it s often not a clean drop in line voltage but more of a brown out situation low voltage still present not cool for electronic component or worse a surge in power before a brown out this condition also impact my wireless router randomly so the inability for the switch to come back online following a power outage is also affected by my router s ability to come back online in the 5 month i ve had this switch i ve had to walk over an manually press the reset button on the rear of the device no biggee unless i used this device in a remote control scenario again this feature hasn t diminished my 5 star rating net evaluation none of the con take away from why i purchased this device it s stable provides lot of flexibility and is a recommended buy would i buy another one the 40 price tag drive a fair amount of need on my part before i ll part with the cash i ve tried other competitor with a slightly lower price however the cloud support set up doesn t hold a candle to wemo disclosure wemo nor anyone else gave me a single nickel to write this review it s absolutely unbiased i m motivated only by the desire to share a good thing with others when i come across it happy automating,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

not reliable,2.0,i did not receive any discount nor did i get this product for free i paid full price my husband ha been into making our home automated from cat wiring to light turning on with voice he s an it major and he sure is putting it to good use laugh out loud he wanted this wifi light control so that we could turn off light with our voice or from our phone if gone so he got this one well he wa so wanting it to work but it failed he say it s not very reliable works sometimes he hooked it up through our amazon echo and it barely worked it would work great for a few testing then it would say sorry i do no understand that command but yet it would turn the light on off so if you have a huge house you would think that it s not working and have to walk to check it and find that it wa working after the firmware update this started happening before the firmware update the echo worked fine with it app doe not work well not easy to set up took him 30 minute to set up when it should have taken way le than that the whole set up wa just a nightmare so i can not give this product more than a two star and the two star is only because it worked half the time or it would have gotten a one star hoping this issue can get fixed so needle to say this product is not reliable at all,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
is this product ready for the market,1.0,i bought this a few month ago and only today decided to try it out i relied on the past reputation of belkin had a read some of the review i probably would not have purchased i want it to work with the echo dot 2 i finally wa able to set it up and get it to work after considerable time and effort at least an hour i only have an engineering background the instruction are completely useless it appears from other reviewer that their customer support capability are among the worse since many if not most customer support staff are relatively bad this is saying a lot obviously belkin no longer care what their name is attached to it is clear that this product is not ready to be sold and used by the mass market but perhaps only more suitable for techie type in the wireless data field overall it is really quite a shame that the management of this company would want to stand behind this type product this is the type of product we use to laugh about 50 year ago when some foreign country were just starting to produce and sell good on the world market if belkin management ceos etc are willing to stand behind these product then that say it all the question remains though should amazon,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

simple device if you only want to automate a few thing,3.0,i ve been doing home automation since the x10 day my current system is mostly insteon and is controlled by an indigo server this setup is rock solid reliable if you have a wi fi network and don t want to invest in any home automation hub or controller this device and it s sibling will probably work for you it s pretty simple to set up and control from your handheld device the device seems to be well made the downside is there are only a few module out for wemo right now i don t see any dimmer module all of the lighting requires investing in a hub the upside is belkin and some other company are actively promoting it so it doesn t look like it will die off soon,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works great with echo,4.0,it arrived today and in a few minute i had it set up so that all i say is alexa light on and in a half second the light is on alexa then say ok same for light off during setup you can change the default name of the device the default wa wemo switch which i changed to light so if i automate more light i will have to add an extra word like bedroom light or kitchen light i deducted one star because the setup using the wemo app is a bit obscure you download it open it up and it tell you to go to setting which you cannot get to in the app ok so after a minute or so of huh i realized that they wanted me to go to my tablet setting not wemo setting they could have made that clear it also temporarily fiddle with the wifi while setting up and in my case froze when it wa finished just reboot the app and your wifi connection after the wemo is set up just tell your echo alexa discover device alexa will say the device she find and your switch should be working on alexa voice command,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

love wemo switch for enabling remote control of my entire home,5.0,love my wemo switch my entire home ha every lamp plugged in with a wemo switch many of the switch i have a power strip plugged in so that multiple light are all plugged into one switch and thus i have more than double the number of light a switch the reason wasn t so much for cost saving a sheer space having 3 4 light in close proximity and using one wemo switch each becomes quite bulky and space is at a premium i am eagerly awaiting the dimmer wall switch so that i can complete my full home automation and eliminate the last thing that i have to physically go and turn off on which is the ceiling light controlled by wall switch i wa not willing to sacrifice the dimming option on my ceiling light which is why i have not used the already available wemo wall switch for it in a few month the new wemo dimmer will be out i have all my wemo connected light connected to my google home a well a ifttt so i ve had a lot of fun experimenting with setting rule that pick up my location and when i arrive home ifttt ha turned on all the light in my home for me at other time i can say hey google and then turn off everything and 17 light instantly go off,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

don t waste your money,2.0,bought my second switch in july after the first quit working now the second switch quit again i have searched the web for fix and tried all of the method to get it to work with no success the first switch worked perfectly until it quit the second switch would let me turn it on at sunset but wouldn t actually turn off at the selected time it would only turn off at sunrise while not ideal it wa acceptable today it failed it started by not being detected reset did not work uninstalling the app and reinstalling did not work i m done i will either find a wireless alternative or i will go low tech and install a light sensor or a plain on off switch i would not recommend this product to a friend hell i won t even recommend to an enemy,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i bought 2 neither work anymore get another product,1.0,first of all connecting them can be a pain for example there s a point in the setup process where the app say something like please wait connecting to wemo for about 30 second and then it will fail try it a second time and it will work immediately go figure and that s just one example there are 3 separate issue i ve had with my wemos each wemo ha had all 3 of these issue at some point the first issue is that the app is no longer able to communicate with the wemo reliably sometimes this mean that you try to turn off a wemo remotely and the app hang indefinitely without turning off the light then if you force close the app and open it back up it might happen to work that time but maybe not half the time you ll end up having to walk over to the wemo and turn it on or off manually however the rule might still work when this happens meaning the wemo work okay in an automatic sense but is not in your manual control the second issue is that the wemo disconnect from the wifi spontaneously this can happen a day after setup or 3 week after setup but it always disconnect you d think it would just reconnect when the signal strength wa appropriate after all each wemo switch doe save a copy of the wifi credential but nope once it disconnect it just give up the only way to reconnect it is to do a factory reset and perform the entire setup all over again including connecting it to wifi and setting up the rule one thing to note is that the rule sometimes still work a in the example above but half the time it will also inexplicably forget the rule you ve programmed into it the third issue is that it forgets the rule spontaneously usually this happens within 24 hour of the factory reset you just performed because your wemo disconnected itself from the wifi and wa too lazy to reconnect when it forgets the rule naturally you ll try to set up the rule again the app will claim that the rule have been saved into the device but the device won t execute them and when you open the app again you ll find that there are no rule listed this ha been the most frustrating and disappointing product i can remember buying with the exception of my lg nexus 5x that tell you how bad lg suck,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great now that i have reserved an ip in my router,5.0,i now own 12 of these wemo switch and they have been working perfectly for the last 6 month but that wasn t always the case i got my first wemo switch before christmas 3 year ago to control my christmas light every month or so they would drop off my home network and the wemo app showed them a not detected they just quit working i would have to unplug and plug them back in to get them working again it wa frustrating but i thought it wa a small price to pay for the convenience i purchased more wemo switch to control table lamp and my porch light but the more i had it seemed the problem go worse i wa resetting these thing weekly and sometimes more than once in a day i wanted to throw them out and customer service didn t have clue this may be a bit too techy for some people but this is what i did one day i had an idea i know that when a network device ha a dhcp assigned ip address the ip is leased and will change once the lease expires typically 24 hour i thought what if i set a static or reserve an ip address in my router that never change voilà that did the trick i haven t had a single problem since and that wa about 6 month ago that i made to change i would recommend to anyone having problem with these switch a i wa to try setting a static ip address before giving up it s not too difficult and for me it wa well worth the 20 minute that it took,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great for turning on a lamp or two or for your spaceship bridge,4.0,if you plan to use this switch to perform smart home function connected through ifttt google home it ll do the trick every once in a while there is a one or two second delay before it switch on off i d say it fails to even trigger once ever 50 us or so but this is all subject to your wifi setting and condition if you happen to play artemis space ship bridge simulator you can tie this into your simulation using a free program called bridge tools great for a red alert light when compared to philips hue the wemo switch fall short this is understandable since hue ha it own hub for dedicated signaling if you only want to turn on off a few light the wemo is a cheap option but if you need to do more than a couple you should look at other solution that said the cool thing about the wemo is that it will power anything you plug into it not just lamp,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love this setup,5.0,this is a review for the regular wemo smart switch not the insight switch i have four of them controlling two table lamp in my living room and two in my bedroom they are large but not too big the official wemo app is slow but other than that the setup is straightforward make certain that your wifi router is transmitting at 2 4ghz and not 5ghz also make certain that wifi security is set to wpa2 only and not wpa or wpa wpa2 i suspect people having issue with the setup have incompatible router setting i am using these switch with my google home and ifttt for voice control i also use the timer function built into the app which turn one living room lamp on automatically in the evening before i get home so that i walk into a well lit house the app s timer then automatically turn off all lamp at bedtime i considered going with phillips hue bulb or smartthings but the total cost for the same automation would have been much much higher plus those product require a hub i love my setup and the lower cost,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
switch appeared previously used and would not connect to wireless network,3.0,i had high hope for this product a my wemo light switch work perfectly and are very convenient but there were a couple problem that ultimately made me return this switch first although the shipping box wa undamaged and the product box appeared unopened the switch wa visibly scuffed a if previously opened and used see attached photo i decided to overlook that and use it anyway at which point i found the switch simply would not connect to my home s wireless network again my wemo light switch experience wa flawless so i expected this to work equally well after following wemo s troubleshooting instruction multiple reset of the switch and digging around for anything else that could help i gave up and returned it amazon is exchanging it and i really hope the replacement work properly nevertheless first impression last and i can t recommend this based on the experience i had with it update the replacement unit arrived and strangely it also had slight scuffing near the prong after 3 factory reset and reinstalling the wemo app it wa finally able to connect to my wireless network compared to the wemo light switch setup experience the wemo switch s wa just awful bumping the rating up to 3 star because it doe finally work and is really convenient but the setup process need vast improvement,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
my first echo peripheral,4.0,i bought this switch to test out my amazon echo s home control function i use it on the lamp on my bedside table the echo seems to take longer a few second but all other command are recognized immediately to understand command to the switch but otherwise they work together well i d like to replace my wall switch with wemos to give my echo control of all my light and ceiling fan but i m waiting for belkin to add dimming capability to them something that in my opinion they sould have had from day one,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great a a sleep timer and easily connected to echo,4.0,my wife like to watch tv in bed before she go to sleep of course she always fall asleep with the tv on the tv ha a sleep timer but it s buried in a menu tree and there s no way you re going to navigate it every night to set the timer i have a harmony remote but it s of no use either i got this switch because it seemed like it wa going to fit my need and it sort of ha it connected to my home s wifi easily and i downloaded the wemo app to my android phone no problem turning the switch on and off i tested in the same room a the router with a lamp plugged in rather than the television this is where my sort of comment from above come in but it s ok what i wa hoping for wa a button on the phone that would set a sleep timer instead i had to make a rule that simply said if this device is turned on between 6pm and 2am turn it off in 90 minute the rule wa very easy to do and it worked without a problem feeling confident i then turned to my amazon echo i told the echo to look for the device and it found it with no problem i wa then able to turn the switch on and off by voice command i then moved the switch to the bedroom and plugged in the tv here s the problem and this is my problem the bedroom is at one end of the house and the router is at the other end of the house i ve had sporadic signal issue in the past and the wemo wa no different point to point it s about 80 foot the wemo reconnected to the network when i moved it but i still had the dresser moved away from the wall once i moved the dresser back into place i lost the wemo i moved it so it would be above the dresser and haven t had a problem since apparently the 80 foot wa ok but the dresser wa a deal breaker this switch certainly meet my need and i think it s kind of cool to walk into the bedroom and tell the echo to turn on the television,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great but expect a learning curve lousy support,4.0,you really have to pay attention to what you re doing to get the most out of these wemo thing they work fine but can be very picky belkin s support suck egg multiple sites say you have a couple of wemos at two remote location hundred or thousand of mile apart both network have to carry the same ssid if they don t you won t be able to control multiple location from one phone to make that work you need a use the same ssid e g bobnet you can t call them bobnet_1 and bobnet_2 nor bobnet and bobnet they must be identically named ssids then you ll have to run different sub net e g 192 168 1 xxx and 192 168 2 xxx this work you can control up to the max wemos the app will handle at up to 999 location using this approach wifi v cell say you are using your wemo s at multiple site and you ve got them all setup a above turn off wifi before you tap touch or try to use the remote wemo if you fail to do this the app will wipe the remote wemo from your phone and you will have to re pair it on site when you get on back on that lan because it can t do it over the cell re pairing is a real pia and that lan is mile and mile away firmware upgrading another issue is firmware upgrading be very careful where you are physically located if you upgrade the fw which happens periodically fist off you have to be on the lan where the device you want to upgrade is located at the time of the fw upgrade once that happens the other wemo s won t work on your app anymore until you get on that lan and upgrade the fw from there it also won t power on even manually so either way one of them is going to be a pia until you get back in and get it fixed i don t know if having the app on multiple phone with one at each location at the time of the fw upgrade would make a difference we have it on multiple phone but we are never independently all individual location so i ve never tried that power failures i have z e r o issue with the wemo s and power failure i ve seen a lot of these and given a few minute for the internet connection and lan to come back up then the wemo to connect it go right back to where i left it if i had it powered off it reconnects and stay powered off if i had it powered on it reconnects and stay powered on this is perfect support for each issue above belkin had no assistive support whatsoever don t look to belkin for support just assume you will need to do some homework on your own they did say it wa not possible to use the wemo at multiple site from the same phone which wa wrong that said once you get your wemo s setup they are very handy indeed i use mine to secure electric garage door opener at site about a thousand mile apart bottom line the wemo work reliably and a designed i and many others have issue with belkin s software programming choice but that can be worked around i agree we should not have to work around it but at least we can,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i have 4 of them now make your home smarter,5.0,once you set these bad boy up it open a whole world of smart home opportunity we started with just lamp then over christmas we plugged our tree light in to one of these using ifttt at the time we could tell our google home to turn the tree off and on i dropped a widget on my android powered phone and could do it even faster or a we were walking up to the house to admire the tree through the window a we approached now wemo ha a direct integration with google assistant so no need for ifttt to do the same thing you can also use the wemo app although it s slower and clunkier in my opinion in the winter i plugged a space heater in to this for my garage because it turned on off with a knob instead of digital button i setup another ifttt to turn on the space heater 30 minute before i planned to workout in the garage it helped warm thing up before i started sweating the last setup we created wa a crock pot for those recipe that only need a few hour instead of 10 you can turn on the crockpot while at work and get home just in time for it to finish and still be piping hot something our second digital crockpot struggled with i will say we have a strong wifi signal which probably help but i have had no connection problem setup is easy through the app and wemo is generally connected with most smart home device a they re a pretty common name in that space overall i d highly recommend we have 4 in our house,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the product is not bad the software is,1.0,let s be clear the product is not bad the software is as a matter of fact the software is terrible you can trust me on this one because i have 14 different device installed at home they are all working sort of but it is not that easy setting up is ok and it s not the main problem in the last few year i had all sort of difficulty but the last one is far from preventing me from posting this negative review i had everything working fine after many many problem it took me a few month and contact with belkin to get them to work and then a firmware update came to mess everything you cannot avoid the firmware download so the application just tell you that is installing the new firmware and you have to wait after that happened all my device keep showing downloading in the app and you cannot control them in an effort to get them working i tried a different phone because mine is an android i thought that maybe my wife iphone would work so i downloaded from the apple store and installed but the same thing happened on my phone i tried do uninstall and reinstall it many time but the problem persist tried on an ipad on a samsung galaxy tab2 and 2 different android phone but with no success i even tried to turn off all my house electricity turn back on to see if would stop the problem but it did not so what point am i if i open the wemo app in any of my phone or tablet all them keep showing the downloading message and don t let me do anything with them what wa programed is working but i cannot access any switch to change anything there is an alternative app that is far from perfect much slower but at least let me control the switches and insights it s called memo widgets i also have 2 motion sensor and they trigger the corresponding light but i cannot change any setting any more hope that this ha helped you just so you don t think i am a total idiot i am an engineer with 35 year of experience in digital technology and i have 117 ips taken in my home network aside from the wemo device everything work flawlessly best regard,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i can say the switch is working great amazing accurate to programming dusk,4.0,this lowly little switch is only a piece of the puzzle a few month after install i can say the switch is working great amazing accurate to programming dusk dawn etc suffers power fails nicely and i will probably buy additional switch for other lamp appliance it is a 3 wire dry contact relay not an electronic switch so it will handle other than purely resistive load and several 100 watt of lighting it is 802 11x wifi based and need a good signal for proper function i have not yet tried enabling off site access if you have a wemo system this switch is a must the somewhat bigger piece of the puzzle is the smart phone any idevice or android app that control the switch and any other wemo device you have the app is confusing unreliable and want it s hand in every part of your smart device such is why i have not enabled internet access it took several hour of setup update reset setup update reset to finally get the phone switch and wifi to agree with each other once done it is pretty stable do your research well on the installation process and what it is doing there are web site and review that explain the whole process including what it access why and how to keep it in check at this point i am please with the whole system,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

the good doesn t block the bottom socket if you use,3.0,after toying with the idea of throwing a relay and arduino nano in my wall socket to automate the socket i decided against possibly burning my house down i ended up buying the wemo plug and a cheaper alternative and i wa impressed with neither the good doesn t block the bottom socket if you use a normal size plug beneath easy to setup and connect to wifi automatically recognized and added into home automation by alexa the bad drops wireless connection frequently and i return to find the light amber sometimes it just need to be power cycled sometimes i need to go back into the app and remove the wireless setting and reconnect it get super hot when the switch is on you can hear a super high pitched ringing that slowly drive you insane if you want to plug in anything that s not a standard 2 3 prong plug like an ac adapter below the device you re out of luck the final verdict i won t be buying any more wifi switch until the tech come along more the outlet i wanted this device for is right next to my couch for a 3in1 reading lamp the high pitched wine wa distracting and there s a basket with blanket in front of the outlet and i didn t want anyone tossing a blanket on this hot device so it s moved to the basement for that purpose it work fine to control a light and fan that i don t want on 24 7 and when it drop connection and i don t get to reset it for a few day no biggie,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
nice for convenience not for critical applications,4.0,works fairly well you will need to pair it up with ifttt to get the most out of it i could never get the built in scheduler to work correctly when it did work it wa always an hour off and most the time it simply did nothing using ifttt to schedule turning the switch on or off work considerably better and you can use a variety of recipe to trip the switch currently i have it set to turn on my air conditioner whenever the outside air temperature go over 90 degree the only hitch is that occasionally my switch will decide it cannot be found neither by the native belkin wemo app or by ifttt the only fix is to unplug the switch for a few moment then plug it back in to reset it obviously this is not something that can be fixed from afar a you need to be physically present to unplug and replug the switch because of this you could never ever trust this switch to critical application for non critical or convenience application however i recommend it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
seamless install with a learning curve and i am thrilled work exactly a i hoped,5.0,i bought three of these recently and i m very satisfied important advice do not be in a hurry when you install your first smart switch because there is a small learning curve and you ll probably thrash around a bit thankfully i had read the review here on amazon so i knew to expect the setup to be a little bit trying but after i learned what to do it wa seamless when you get your switch just plug it in to a wall outlet within range of your wireless network and also plug a lamp into it for testing next connect your smartphone s wifi to the switch s temporary network which will be called wemo switch xxx where xxx are the last 3 digit of the serial number instead of to your local area network then open the belkin wemo app on your smartphone android 4 0 or later or iphone while connected to the temporary network the very first time you connect to one of these temporary network it will ask you to help the switch get onto your local area network lan so at that time you need to type in the name of your lan called ssid in the documentation and it password if you buy 50 switch you ll only need to do this once because belkin will then store the information in the cloud for any future switch in your house to use after that the belkin wemo app should switch back to your regular lan and then should open a screen when you can name the switch use the name that describes the device you ll be switching i named mine bird lights green up light and red up light for example once that s done you can if you wish create rule for the switch in case you want to use it a a timer for example also once this is done if you have an amazon echo device just say alexa discover belkin wemo device and it should find them within a reasonably short time perhaps minute but in my case only second once it ha found them you can command the echo to turn the switch on off by saying for example alexa turn on bird lights or whatever your switch is called or alexa turn off bird lights it s that simple i didn t have a single issue with any of the three switch once i understood the procedure note also that soon after installation each switch wanted to get a firmware update this is new software for inside the switch that get downloaded from the belkin website it will ask you when you connect to the belkin wemo app if the firmware update can proceed and when you give the go ahead the switch may be unreachable for a few minute while the firmware downloads and the switch reboots give it 20 minute to be sure everything should be back after that i had none of the problem reported just a few week ago with echo it found them quickly and turn them either on or off a requested i also put two device in a group using the belkin wemo app and the echo let me turn them on off all at once using the group name good product worth the staggering 40 per switch cost for those few device that have special need in my case that wa one set of light that i wanted to come on at sunrise and off at sunset the bird lights and without needing an actual light sensor also two lamp that sit in corner where it s difficult to reach their switch i turn them off later at night to prepare my eye for bedtime so the smart switch allow me to turn them off without having to climb over furniture just to reach the physical switch of the lamp yay for home automation amazon echo and belkin wemo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great when it work frustrating software troubleshooting,4.0,nice gadget for use with alexa we use the switch to turn on fan and small low current electric heater when watching tv or when in the bed it s nice to be able to get alexa to turn on off a fan or small heater setup is a usually straightforward but some situation are difficult to resolve if there is a software update for alexa or for the wemo switch odd thing can happen it is possible that they will all work with alexa but alexa cannot discover them the wemo app might word fine for controlling them but alexa cannot discover them and once wemo couldn t find any switch nor could alexa but alexa would control the switch i ve been able to resolve these problem usually with a router reset in case of a problem i m never sure if it is with alexa wemo or my own network often there are month of operation with no problem i don t know if any competing vendor have equipment that is more reliable just plan on occasionally having to troubleshoot the device and otherwise enjoy the convenience of the switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not perfect but useful,4.0,i saw this and thought it would be perfect to put on the plug that i connect a small electric heater to to be able to turn off when i leave the house or turn on a few minute before i need to go in the room where this heater is the wemo work fine for this in fact it work better than the g e quirky pivot power genius which doe not seem to be able to work or sense the state of it switch reliably yes i have one of those too the belkin is much better done because for one thing it ha the mac address of the device printed on it so setup is easier the app is easier and more intuitive to use and it actually work better however every time i set a wemo up and i have 3 of them now i always got an error but then they always started working at some point i don t really know what happened but it work you can turn off and on these switch from anywhere in the world and with the belkin you can know whether the switch is on or off at least better than you can with the quirky one thing i really do not like is the large housing the switch come in that is so big it really make the other plug in a receptacle a problem to use i can only put smaller thing in the plug beneath my wemo because the housing is so large that it cover some of the area my extension cord need to plug in that could have been noticed and fixed before they sent this out and there s no need for it that i can see one of the first device of it kind be aware that you need a connection to the internet to work the way i think this work is that your cellphone us the internet to connect to belkins s server somewhere and the wemo device maintain some kind of vpn connection to server a well when your phone app connects it must go out on the internet and then back to your phone this is why there is occasionally a fairly large lag and if there is an internet or server problem it might not work at all at least for a time i think it would be nice if the apps were smart enough to know when they are connected to the home network and to be able to directly communicate with the wemo over the local network without having to run everything all over the world being a network device and having a vpn right into your network it is possible that hacker of the nsa could exploit that and access your home computer video camera or other device you have set up on the internet,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
when they work they are great but i d say save your money for something more reliable and user friendly,2.0,while i purchased two of these switch from amazon to complement my amazon echo i must say that i now regret having made this purchase i have other wemo switch purchased elsewhere a well totaling 8 my initial thought about the setup process wa that it wa a cockamamie process but it did seem to work when the switch work they work quite well my particular installation ha them in spot that are difficult to access requiring a ladder or crawling on the floor to reach them this is the rub they are flaky in that they work quite well almost all the time but they lose a connection and become inoperative belkin s support service is unreliable and in my opinion deceptive i have had an engineer reputedly contact me and ask what time were good for a support call obviously i responded and never heard from them again i want reliability not something i can t count on to work when i want it to work i have spent a fair amount of money on these and i will be getting rid of them and moving to another product which i guess i can t mention here,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a nightmare,3.0,i really wanted this belkin wemo set up to be the solution to my smart lighting goal specifically for iphone controlled outdoor lighting with auto on off around sunset sunrise i started with a wemo light switch pretty easy to switch out the current light switch but serious difficulty getting wemo onto home network and it kept insisting on firmware update that took much more than the up to 10 minute that pop up in the app but after a few hour i finally got it working and the app is reasonably intuitive to create the on off rule i wanted so then i went on to a wemo switch and a couple of wemo bulb with a hub total 2 week nightmare first the bulb were slow to pair but then when i had them paired and tried to group them they both went out as in no light and no way to get the light to come back even following the reset procedure on the belkin web site or trying them in another fixture like a lamp after an hour call with belkin tech support responsive and friendly but just had me run through standard procedure that i had already done they thought it wa a hardware issue and had me request an exchange with amazon so i did that got the new bulb and the same thing happened belkin confirmed i had followed the correct installation procedure and after another 1 5 hour on the phone they agreed to exchange them directly but i had to argue for 10 minute that they should pay for the shipping two week later the replacement bulb arrive and still grouping cause them to short out you could even see black streak inside the bulb meanwhile the wemo switch took a while to install and be recognized but it wa working even for the switch and initial light switch the app constantly loses them and the only way to find them again is to go off wifi on the iphone verizon lte always refinds them then i can switch back to wifi complete pain this is the short version of the saga not smart not easy not reliable meanwhile two week ago i saw that samsung smartthings hub version 2 had come out read some good review and ordered one while waiting for it to arrive i got some cree connected bulbs from home depot ten minutes of installation and i had the bulb and smartthings hub up and running bulbs recognized instantly hub ha no wifi accessibility issue and on off response is very quick in the app so i ordered a ge smart switch to expand installed that on the garage overhead light switch and right away it showed up in the app so easy so much better than wemo more accessory on the way to my house right now only downside just like a cnet review say is that the smartthings app is quite confusing you really have to work at figuring out how to set up rule but i figure that the key is for the hardware installation to be straightforward and then it s much easier to improve the app in coming month,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great for me,5.0,works great for me with amazon echo dots the wemo app is dumb and doesn t always let you see the newest firmware update even though they are available opening the app on a different device iphone ipad etc allowed me to get the prompt that new firmware wa available to update despite that slight annoyance i m overall happy because alexa control my light and otherwise the wemo app work fine you can even schedule them to come on turn off at different time which is kind of an obvious feature but still smarter than a regular switch because you can set it to sunrise sunset which will constantly be changing throughout the year but it will auto correct it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not just a switch a computer with a wireless transceiver,5.0,updated on june 14 2015 i maintain the five star rating of this product the original firmware version wa wemo_us_2 00 2176 pvt which cause a problem with amazon echo but this is fixed with version wemo_us_2 00 3949 pvt the problem wa that if you ask alexa to turn on the light she will but after about half hour if you ask her to turn the light off it will not be turned off unless you re discover the device turn on then turn off an inconvenient workaround to update the firmware open the wemo app on an android device and reset the device by pressing and holding the restart and the reset button for five second and then releasing them the light on the wemo switch will blink to green then amber which mean a successful reset at this point a message will pop up on the wemo app saying a new firmware update is available let it update the problem then go away original review there are 3 step to get this to work with an android device or ios 1 download and install the wemo app 2 search for this switch in available wifi network just like you d be searching for your router and connect to it 3 run the wemo app which will ask you to pick your actual router and credential to connect to it done the wemo app will revert back to your router connectivity and this switch will appear in your list of device for wemo if you have amazon echo simply say alexa search for my device wait until she find the switch then you can say alexa turn on the wemo switch or you can change the name of the switch in the wemo app to something like the light and let alexa find it for you,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it s a bit bulky and buggy but doe the job that i need it to do,4.0,i had a bit of an issue right out of the box when it attempted to do a firmware update it seemed like it did download the update however the app really never indicated that it wa finished i left it on for well over an hour before finally manually powering it down and crossing my finger when it came back on luckily it took the update although i wa a bit worried that i bricked it also a con is the size of the unit itself it s bulky and take up the whole outlet that aside i have maintained a pretty good wifi connection i wa able to change the name of the unit from wemo to tree since i ve since hooked it up to turn on off my christmas tree it work pretty well with amazon alexa however there wa a few time that it disconnected from the wemo skill app within the alexa app and i had to use the wemo android app to recover from this i have not used any of the rules yet but hope to set this up a an on off timer in the very near future overall i would have to say this is great device but need a bit of work on the android app and integration into alexa it s a must have for an automated smart home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
lousy instruction with product and the help file is horrid,4.0,original feedback followed by update original never left a 1 on anything before i programmed the timer after i finally got it to connect to my wi fi set to come on from 8 to 11 30 in the evening and 4 40 to 7 30 in the morning maybe it come on maybe it doesn t sometimes it turn it self off in the middle of an on cycle and then it may or may not come back on sometime later this morning it came on at 7 40 when i wa leaving the house updated feedback when creating a rule do not use the away mode in the automate section a a template i wanted to set the time for when i wa away so i clicked on this rule and modified it this is the wrong way to configure this device away mode seems to ignore the time and date you set what it does do is it turn the switch on and off and random interval i did see it come on at my schedule but every 30 to 40 minute it would turn off then a while later back on again this is not in the minimal instruction in the box and the help file doesn t help instead use the by time sunrise sunset setting in the control a device section then it work perfectly do not use the setting under automate that caught my eye and so i kept going back to it wrong section i have it set to come on a half hour before sunset and turn off at a specific time this is perfect since it get dark about 5 pm in the winter and about 10 pm in the summer i am not going to have to constantly change the mechanical timer remember do not use the automate section for controlling the on off and you will be happy a a clam,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
arlo wemo great after a work around,5.0,before purchasing this item i tried to determine if it would work with my arlo motion detector camera and ifttt if this then that website i couldn t find a confirmation but i did find a rule in place on the ifttt website that led me to believe it would work what i wanted to do wa to plug a lamp into this wemo switch and have it come on if off or turn off if on at the time that my arlo device detected motion the purpose is to deter a would be burglar at night i received the wemo switch and had no problem setting it up it connected immediately to my wi fi and i wa able to connect to ifttt a well the problem arose when i attempted to setup the rule that i wanted it continually failed apparently the arlo wasn t working a i had hoped however and i provide this information for others to use if needed i found that i could have arlo send me a google email and use the google email to trigger the wemo switch it work perfectly now my lamp is blinking on and off all day i need to re think having the arlo on 24 hour a day but the point is that the switch doe work exactly a it should i can also easily turn the lamp on or off using the wemo app on my phone or ipad now i plan to see what other security us i can find for the wemo product i don t really understand the negative review this product work perfectly,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
won t stay connected long enough to set up wireless stop transmitting,1.0,just go the amazon echo and wa pretty impressed wanted to hook up this wemo to it and it arrived today wemo boot fine i connect to it via iphone app connect give it the lan credential then it go into a discovering device phase on the app for several minute until the wemo seems to timeout or shutdown app say we ve lost connection with the wemo device please quit this app reconnect to the wemo network and reopen this app at this point the iphone can t see the wemo wireless connection at all so i re initialize the wemo and i can repeat this same process over and over the wemo seems to stop transmitting while the app is in a discovering device loop it ha a very strong signal and is close line of sight to the router which ha plenty of open address space and is ready to play instructions say to update but that s hard when it won t connect i ve reinstalled the app rebooted everything and moved location of the wemo just to be sure this is an incredibly frustrating experience spending hour on something simple don t need this kind of headache the device seems to be poorly made and make alexa sad,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

frustrated and in the dark,1.0,i wa excited when my switch arrived before my amazon echo i thought it would be nice to set up the light switch to the car port and in the living room so we could access them remotely to make it look like we were home when we were out or to light up the first couple of room when we come home at night after a couple of hour of frustration i am going to have my first return of something ordered through amazon i keep having the following problem 1 the application will not detect the switch and the only solution is to uninstall and reinstall the application reset the switch and try again 2 the application finally detects the network for the switch and connect to the switch in the time it take to type in living room light a the name for the switch the phone loos connection to the wemo network if i am lucky i can just unplug and plug the switch back in and reconnect at other time it connects to something called 3g and the only way to get it to connect to the wemo network is to uninstall and reinstall the app again 3 the application finally detects the switch allows me to set my desired name but loos connection to the wemo network when it try to connect to my wireless network if i am lucky i just unplug and plug the switch back in redetect the wemo network rename the switch and try again if not it connects to 3g and i have to uninstall the app download it again reset the switch and try again i haven t even tried the light switch yet but if this is how poorly the wall switch work i am not uninstalling a light switch and wiring in a wall unit just so i can have the same frustration,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great for a day,1.0,intermittently doe not respond to alexa have this switch hooked up to a lamp when it chooses to not work alexa responds with a sorry your device is not responding please check your network connection blah blah blah this ha become an everyday occurrence i have completely reset both system to factory installed firmware update etc works great for a day then back to the same error contacted belkin tech support explained everything i did and of course i get a response back asking me if i reset everything and updated the firmware this obviously demonstrates that belkin tech support themselves are pre programmed not even reading what i had already done now i could take it upon myself to re prioritize my wifi device change device lease in the router etc but i shouldn t have to i bought a product that doesn t state only work sometimes but we can fix it by doing this this then this then that oh yeah and then this too and if you ever change or upgrade your network you will have to call tech support back not what i signed up for do a web search of how many other people are having the same issue before purchasing this product i got one to try for this reason before i bought a bunch on to the next supplier for me i hear zwave maintains a very reliable connection so i will try that one next,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
what a disappointment,2.0,i desperately wanted to like this i bought two one for myself and one for my parent in hope that they would like it and i would get them more for different room of the house thankfully i tested mine first what a disappointment the point of this is to not have to get up and turn the light on however it would constantly lose connection with the app my first clue that it wouldn t go well is when i went to download the app to my phone and the app rated poorly so they are both getting returned oh and i figured the product would be on the large size but seriously this thing is massive save your money and buy something else,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
these are great,5.0,these are great the very first one wa a bit challenging to set up after a call to customer service the rep wa very helpful and got me up and running in no time the other one i bought were a breeze after that i have them linked to my echo dot and ask alexa frequently to turn them on and off three of these are connected to himalayan pink salt lamp i have in my home and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is to ask alexa to turn on all of the salt lamp and poof they are on i also have one connected to my christmas tree light which i ll find another purpose for when i take it down in a few day it is also very simple to use the app to turn them on or off and i wa particularly happy that the app worked fine with my kindle fire unlike many other apps that are supposedly available there but no longer supported and won t work at all like philips hue what a nightmare that one wa highly recommend these were my first foray into the smart home world and i m thrilled,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

does it job well with some nagging thing that irk me but don t impact the core functionality,4.0,works very well with amazon echo alexa the response time is nearly instant especially compared to my hue bulb and the build quality seems good my only con are the physical design these plug take up a lot of real estate on an outlet or standard surge suppressor and you can t rotate the plug so on some 6 outlet surge suppressor you may get two open outlet plus the one on the smart plug knowing that this is a gadget designed for people who are likely already desperately low on outlet this seems kind of shortsighted although this feel substantial enough to run a whole surge through it so perhaps that s why the engineer made that choice but for me controlling a couple lamp on a single plug and a fan on the other it feel kind of silly the packaging there s literally four or five piece of clear tape holding this complicated unfolding box that feel like a lower tier apple package dude it s an electrical plug save some dough especially when selling through amazon to nerd like me and knock a buck off the msrp i got mine for 20 each which still feel a bit high,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
smart outlet great for automation software isn t perfect but shouldn t hold you back good buy,4.0,i bought this outlet because i like automation in my home and also in the hope that some day i might work myself up to getting an echo or dot i really like using it to charge my phone for a few hour in the middle of the night i like that you can create program using the software that tell the outlet when to turn on and off i also like that i can access the outlet through the app from almost anywhere the down side to this outlet is that the software doe not allow you to do a countdown timer you can set it to start at a certain time and stop after a certain amount of time but you cannot just say be on for 1 hour there is a feature that allows you to cycle the timer but i don t find this helpful because it just keep turning the timer on and off over a set period of time like 1 hour on and 1 hour off and repeat the other problem i have found is that i have an old apartment with old outlet no ground wire no 3rd prong so when i plug this thing into the wall i have to plug it into on of those converter first and that make the device stick out of the wall even further what that really mean is that it sooner or later it fall out of the wall when i have to pull a plug out of the outlet to switch out one charger for another overall it s still a great device and i recommend it for anyone who want some automation to their home the down side with the software is manageable and the other issue are no fault of the device just the environment i live in i would recommend it to anyone,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
review of wemo switch wemo app,5.0,update 4 5 2 15 still disappointed that every wemo product is still mashed into this one huge review section this update refers to the belkin wemo switch only a recent firmware update ha increased the responsiveness of my 4 wemo switches so that all respond promptly to on off command also the more aggressive integration of the wemo switch with the ifttt app expands the functionality of the wemo switch significantly the app run smoothly i see no flaw in this product that would warrant it receiving anything but 5 star again can not speak for the other wemo product a do not own any i just posted the following review on apple s app store of the wemo app and how it interacts with the belkin wemo switch i m sure everyone ha noticed that amazon clump the review of all the wemo products into one giant review section i am not sure this is best a it is possible that various wemo product are performing at different level for example i noticed that the wemo light switch ha a fair amount of negative review maybe that is because it is the most often bought item in the wemo line maybe it is a le admirable product in my case i wa interested in the wemo wall switch i found it fatiguing to weed through all the review finding the one on that specific product anyway here is my review of the wemo app in conjunction with the wemo wall switch first my hardware and software for reference iphone 6 running ios 8 1 3 12b466 wemo product 4 wemo switches kind that plug into wall outlet version of wemo switch va01 firmware running on wemo switches wemo_us_2 00 7166 pvt app version 1 10 2 20022 here s the good news 1 all 4 of my wemo switches nicely control the device to which i have them connected 3 light and one tv 2 i can successfully control all 4 wemo switches via my home network via the enterprise network at work and via 3g and 4g for those reason the product and app earn 5 stars i had to take away 1 star because of the bad news 1 the app is not refined and often requires several attempt at various task in the setup before success is achieved luckily i am not a novice user of ios technology and am comfortable with trial and error when i set up several of my device i wa told the device wa trying to connect to my network then it told me it failed and to try again or later i kept trying and it kept saying it failed so i stopped trying only to realize that the switch was connected to my network the developer need to fix this inaccurate reporting a many folk would give up right there trying to set up the device 2 i understand the need for firmware update and am actually glad the company is showing attention to area of improvement by the presence of firmware update my switch needed 2 firmware update each again that s fine my only complaint is after the first firmware update on each of my 4 switches i received a celebration banner saying something to the effect that your wemo switch is now running the latest greatest fw version hooray actually that wa not true at all there wa still one more firmware update and only because i noticed a red dot on the menu bar at the bottom of the app screen did i decide to check if there were more firmware update this need fixing each firmware update take a while 5 minute or so that s ok 4 when i experimented and turned on some of my device from work enterprise network and some of my device via 4g parking lot at work everything went fine when i got home all the device were on great however i wa unable to turn 3 of the 4 device off home network because of past experience with other buggy apps i totally closed the wemo app and reopened it i didn t just put it in the background in the recently used app bar that fixed the problem and i wa able to turn off all the device obviously the user shouldn t need to do this reboot the app and some user may not think to do it this is another area for the developer to refine the app all in all i really like this product i have no qualm recommending it but novice user would be encouraged to solicit the assistance of an experienced person during setup and remember my review is with regard to the functionality of the wemo wall switch perhaps it applies to the other product perhaps not,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great idea but too much trouble to use,1.0,what could be better than operating your light remotely so that would be burglar wouldn t know that you weren t home lights on a timer are predictable which i understand burglar figure out however this wemo smart plug wasn t quite smart enough for my purpose if the power go out you have to set the thing up on your wifi again and it s finicky in the set up it wa too much trouble it s now in a drawer,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
this work great i want to get a few more,4.0,this work great i want to get a few more the only reason i did not give it 5 star is because it wa not easy to set up out of the box i had to contact support for further instruction that were not included in the box with the product i had to turn off mobile data first before doing anything but support wa helpful and able to get me all set up i just wish he would have reminded me to turn mobile data back on after setting it up i went two day trying to figure out why my phone would not connect to the internet when i wa not home finally remembered that i turned off mobile data and got it turned back on ooops on my part,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
updated finally found the app works well set security protocol on your wifi,4.0,update i finaly found the wemo app on my ipad it is listed under iphones only it wa easier to install via the app store app than the android app it appears to be working as an aside note after installation the app wanted to update it s firmware due to a security vunerability found they found a vunerability by whereby hacker could hi jack the device and get on your secured network that s why i didn t like the android app with all of those permission and my echo operates the switch nicely original post as of this writing i can find no free wemo app for ipad or iphone in the app store for this switch they say there is but there is none there are paid apps i tried the free android app it want permission to my contact calendar photo call camera and on and on for a switch you ve got to be kidding me i even tried the android app and it basically make you connect to the wemo s unsecured wifi and then try to get it to connect to your personal wifi a bit convoluted if you ask me and it didn t work i have the amazon echo which i love and wanted to try this a an accessory i have a smart thermostat which echo handle nicely this switch doesn t even work on it s own app will look for another brand or system,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
android app offensively invasive,1.0,the android app request access to contacts identity location and a long list of other phone service it shouldn t need this is offensively invasive to the point that i consider it unusable wemo only support being used through the phone app so i guess this thing is useless to me until they fix their app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
4 star for now product may not last depending on the electrical situation in your building home,4.0,wow so many recent bad review it make me worry about this product you need to download the wemo app on your smartphone first pair the switch your phone then to your router over wifi in order to use this switch fail to do any one of these step and the socket switch will not work i have read horror story about having to wait for hour for belkin tech support from their customer service line after your product no longer pair with the router and i do not intend to do that since this is amazon and what break can easily be replaced i also have alexa the amazon echo smart device a voice activated speake with internet connectivity really for your home pairing it with the wemo app allows you to use voice command alexa turn the light on and alexa turn off the light alexa will do a asked and respond with an okay after the task is completed if you do not have an amazon echo that is okay too using the wemo app on your smartphone will allow you to use the wifi connectivity to turn the light switch on and off it is lightning fast in response to pressing the app s power button i will update this review and possibly drop star rating if the switch dy or malfunction like i have seen in other review hopefully that will not be necessary,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
we love these,5.0,we have bought several of these to use with amazon alexa they were great and are easy to set up we put some in a family member s house a she ha trouble with her vision and they make it much easier for her to turn light on a she s entering the room we used them for the christmas tree light and other light around the house it s great to be able to turn on and off light remotely we used to leave our front light on all day in the winter time so it would be on when we got home at night now we can put it on a timer or simply turn it on when we re on our way home while in our home i guess you could call it a bit of a luxury for the disabled like my family member this ha been a lifesaver there is another more upgraded model but the only difference i could see wa that it measure electricity usage that just wasn t something we were looking for the only con to this is it s size i noticed recently that they have come out with smaller one so we will have to look into that if we purchase any more,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
my only smart device that does not connect to wireless,2.0,bought this to replace the automatic timer on my living room lamp i wa tired of constantly adjusting for changing daylight and wanted something i could flip on my from car so i didn t have to enter in the dark or turn off from my bedroom when i choose to go to bed early and it s great when it work it is having a lot of trouble connecting and staying connected to my wifi i have excellent internet speed and a modern router my amazon dash button and nest thermostat both in the same area of my house a the wemo work perfectly wemo doe not even after i tried all of their troubleshooting tip changing channel on my router etc so it s just an expensive automatic timer without the extra i wa excited about i m returning it today,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
this product is the worst product i have ever purchased off of amazon and,1.0,this product is the worst product i have ever purchased off of amazon and i returning the pair of floater i purchased 1st the app doe not work with alexa or ever itself it will not provide you with a page the step asking for your home router information instead acting like it is it own network tried it on an ipad 2 of them and on my cell phone total piece of garbage alexa should be plug and play and i find the fact that amazon advertises this work with alexa without explaining how tortuously retarded and unusable the app is to be reprehensible i do not normally leave review you you should run from these like the plaque interesting belkin ha no support line for their product i now know why they suck stay away from this product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
on the fence,3.0,i bought a couple of these and i ll admit i m on the fence a bit after reading other review i bought them for a couple of lamp to work with the amazon echo here s what i got i downloaded the wemo app and echo identified with the device but one of them work perfectly without any issue and the other work about 85 of the time sometimes i ll tell echo to turn on the 2nd one two or three time till it finally work other time it work without fail my faulty wall adapter is within 2 foot of the router echo the wemo wall adapter and my router are all within a 10 foot proximity but i am not yet prepared to blame the product so far i have had no negative issue with the wemo app to report it ha worked perfectly with it s product without a problem i am still in the learning phase of the whole amazon echo smart home thing but if i can prove it is user error and not the product i will tack on a couple more star but right now i can t say that s the case i have purchased the wemo wall light switch a well which work flawlessly through a wall with plenty of obstruction so i am pretty impressed with it performance,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well away mode in particular,4.0,i use this product for two main purpose first when i am away i use away mode to randomly turn my light on and off to convince a possible intruder that someone is at home because the product is compatible with ifttt i can also use my motion detecting camera to turn the light on immediately if anyone come to the porch when i am not away i use the wemo to turn on a fan or old air conditioner when my wifi thermometer climb to a specific temperature essentially giving my very old air conditioner a thermostat therefore saving me money i have also used the wemo for my christmas tree light at some point i will purchase another few outlet so i can do all of these thing at once but at this time the cost is still a little high to outfit my whole house i got the unit i have when there wa a sale and they were around 20 i am hoping that the price will fall a competition continues from other maker the only thing keeping me from giving five star is the price point and the fact that the app and wifi connection can be buggy at time and i have other wifi connected item in my house that aren t buggy so i know it isn t my wifi but overall i am very satisfied with the product and can recommend it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well unless using multiple echos,3.0,set up wa a bit confusing and i have other wemo product it always happens with new product and their newer firmware update this wa really troublesome because even after an hour of updating the app product it still wa not finished and i have a fast connection had to force stop the app restart and restart my phone after that it operated a advertised connecting to my echo wa easy and work well just not great we have multiple echos in the house and the switch is in the bedroom connected to an echo in there if i give the on command in the living room and the off command in the bedroom there is a 50 50 shot that it will not turn on or off a commanded if i consistently use just one echo it work almost flawlessly for me i would like to turn the bedroom light on before i go in there otherwise it would be quicker to use the switch i have now just begun using the on command while walking in to the room and pause 2 second for it to turn on the light,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
intermittent connectivity issue,3.0,i use a pair of these with an amazon echo to control two lamp in the living room despite several firmware update sometimes it take issuing a command to turn the light on 5 6x half the time it just work most of the time both lamp turn on with the same command not sure if the echo is transactionally issuing the command when both are receptive or they just happen to become receptive at the same time like others have said the insane amount of permission requested by the wemo android app is just insane for what the app should actually require to do it basic job but fortunately with marshmallow you get prompted a they are used the actual device setup in the app wa flakey at best but it did get both setup in a reasonable amount of time with only mild frustration once setup firmware update are fully automatic which is awesome hopefully firmware update will ameliorate the connectivity issue,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
very good product once setup,4.0,if you are thinking about it just buy a switch and try it out this is a solid product i started with just this one switch i now have 4 and two motion sensor an energy monitoring switch is on the way the system is very easy to program however setup can be painful now that i know the issue setup is not so bad first close and open the wemo app if it is acting funny second the app may say it ha problem connecting a device to the network even though it connected to the network once it setup however it is ha been great i dock a star for the setup issue what i love is that i can change the rule from anywhere this mean if i going on vacation i can program the front light to turn on and off at various time from the airport and turn off the light that i don t need off it modular so you can re purpose the switch and motion detector a needed i use wemos it to control various plug in heater on the house that just get left on from time to time if i know we will be using the basement i can turn on the heater manually a few hour before using my iphone also i have rule that turn off the heater at night no matter what so they are no left running the light in my house are programmed to respond to motion sensor my bedroom light turn off at 11pm to remind me to go to bed and turn on a 7am to wake me up if i oversleep just on work day it will also turn on the light if there is any motion in that room for 30 minute minimum from sunrise to 11pm if there is motion at the front door a light turn on and i get a message on my iphone the light in that room is programmed to turn on at sunset and off at 11pm but will respond to motion from 11pm sunset the next day it wa very easy to program all this i wish the motion sensor were battery run since they need to be plugged in outlet not putting one in your shed for example unless it ha power the protocol used is proprietary which is sort of a bummer long term you may need to upgrade the software a few time when you open the box it seems that the upgrade are not all done at once overall this is a very cost effective way to get into home automation its a mass market offering which should make you feel more secure i have other belkin product and they have been great if you are like me you will find that it very empowering to be able to control multiple aspect of your home from your phone with rule my kid love playing with the app given there are no monthly fee the app is free and the sophistication yet ease of the rule setup the value of this product is very high,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i could not hate a product more,1.0,the interface instruction for this product are awful i consider myself pretty tech savvy but there s no way i m buying these for my 73 year old father given how much trouble my first one of these is giving me there d be no way he d ever get it figured out the demo video is one of the most incredibly annoying and useless help video i ve seen for a product sending it back and will look for another,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
just ok i doubt i will buy more wemo stuff though,3.0,so far this is just ok first off the box seems much larger than it need to be i think some of the other wifi outlet control are smaller even the wemo insight plug control seems much smaller in size while it seems to offer more feature secondly the android app is pretty poor not straight forward or obvious enough to the newbie and no info at all on the packaging you must first connect to the wifi offered by the wemo device to get the process going then you have to switch to your main wifi to complete the job it is very similar to setting up a chromecast except the app guidance is le good third the last on off state is not remembered re established after a power outage belkin say this is for safety and i can see that in some case but in others it make no sense at all this should be an end user option for each device don t hold your breath for it i am only using it so far for simple on off from the app or mostly via a 3rd party command line interface on linux which work well enough so i have not looked into rule and schedule but one thing i that is not clear is what happens to rule schedule after a power outage if there is no wifi available do the rule schedule persist over the power outage if there is no wifi how is current time established is there an internal clock with some form of battery backup to survive power outage if not then without wifi schedule are likely to fail after power outage since internet time cannot be reached one would expect much better from the like of belkin so in a way this is a real disappointment,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i m a happy camper,5.0,edit 12 10 16 added a 4th basic switch tonight amazon warehouse purchase for the christmas tree and in order to connect i needed to restart my phone otherwise it went just a simply a the others enjoying the automation so much i broke down and ordered an echo tonight too think hue light strip are next i discovered these switch while researching the echo didn t get the echo but now have three basic wemo switch one from home depot and two from amazon after studying review i went with the basic switch rather than the insight and i love them turning out light after i ve left the room mean no more tripping over dog toy or the cat i especially like the ability to turn on light remotely when i m going to be late connecting to my note 4 wa simple firmware downloaded without incident each time i connected one definitely getting one more switch for the christmas tree,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love the function hope you can find someone who know how to set it up,4.0,i bought this for my mom for christmas she ha the amazon echo which she love but wa using a clapper on one her primary light in the living room the clapper is okay but man that thing been around for like 25 year and i don t think the technology ha improved you had to run around her living room clapping away until the light would finally cut on my mom life by herself and by the time she get home from work it s pitch black out in the winter so something more effective seemed like a necessity so once set up this thing work great she can just talk to alexa and ask her to turn the light on or she can turn the light on with the app on her phone before she even walk into the house or if she hears something downstairs while she is sleeping she can talk to the echo remote which she keep in her room and have the light come on this is all awesome the downside is that set up is not easy if you buy this for your parent or grandparent be prepared to come set this up for them setting up everyone s technological device in the family ha somehow become my job by default and this still took me 30 minute to get it working 40 if you count the snack i had to have halfway through the process there is a quick start guide included in the package which good luck opening the freaking package by the way but it is not enough to get you started and it certainly isn t quick it essentially just directs you to download the app and then the instruction are in the app which isn t a great user experience because then you have to toggle back and forth on whatever device you are using between the instruction in the app your wifi setting on your device back to the instruction back to the app itself with instruction closed back to wifi setting pain in the rear anyway once this wa set up it wa awesome my mom only ha a lamp plugged into it but i imagine the possibility with this are pretty endless so long story short if you are relatively familiar with network setup stuff or you know someone who is and they owe you a favor this is definitely worth the setup but out of the box this is not something that just anyone would be capable of setting up now i just hope that if my mom decides to move this plug to a different outlet we don t have to go through the whole process again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
spend 10 more and get the wemo insight instead,1.0,it will work remotely and let you program your light to come on and off only this unit will not act a a dimmer the insight by belkin allows you to also monitor your electric usage and ha several other function that make it much more desirable than this model the insight allows you to record the usage of whatever it is plugged into it it will also tell you how much it cost to run whatever is plugged into it and it can send usage spreadsheet file to your email the insight also tell you when thing turn on like a space heater each time it turn on the insight outlet via the wemo app it van be set up to send an alert to your phone my point is the spend the extra 10 and get something that ha tremendous multi function capability these unit are handy a timer and you can check them remotely to insure they are working,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the jury is still out,3.0,first the good it s easy to install albeit somewhat mysterious it work so far ten day the app ios work ok usually the not so good the biggest issue in my case is the necessity to have local access to my lan to set up the app on a new or different device if you re not at home there is no way to do this so you can control the wemo remotely with competing product you set up an account with a password and the device information is stored there adding another controlling device is simple a long a you remember your account information wemo also set up an account somewhere but this is not visible to or accessible by the user one of my home is empty for eight month of the year i want to be able to turn light on and off at random time when everything is working correctly it s fine if i were to lose my cell phone or trade it in i m on the at t next plan i will have no way that i m aware of to teach a new one about wemo from 997 mile away i also had some problem with firmware update with two of the unit the update took a very long time and at the end said update failed the wemo is ten foot from my router with a very reliable 50 mb sec internet connection after several try i checked the firmware version and it wa the same a the first one i updated which completed normally they also seem to work fine so possibly the error wa the error message we ll see,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
by far easiest to set up remote switch ever,5.0,i don t understand the bad review this is by far the smoothest and simplest and i ve tried every remote relay and switch you cant think of remote switch you can think of the app setup wa a breeze it instantly found my wemos and it worked right away no complex set up with dhcp remote or local ips gateway or none of that complicated stuff wa needed to get it to work the other awesome thing is not only doe it work right away from your wifi network it work remotely i wa surprised that it had this feature automatically without any set up on my part this mean you can control security and turn thing on and off camera light security feature recording a show from work or even if your mile away on vacation this may not seem like a big deal but i ve tried a lot of chinese vendor and us vendor remote relay and ir device and spent hour if not day trying to get them to work and they had glitch after glitch with the wemo it wa so easy just opened the app and it seemed to set all this up right off the bat my only gripe is i wish they had more than one electrical connection they take of a lot of horizontal space so they fill up nearly 3 electrical receptacle on my electric strip this also make it difficult to place multiple wemos on the same strip a well perhaps they have one with 2 to 4 electrical outlet already but didn t see one when i purchased this one,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
five stars,5.0,a long after purchase this product ha continued to flawlessly allowing me to remotely reboot my computer system and log back in when it ha locked up wemo ha also pushed out two firmware update since my original purchase showing they stand behind their product after the purchase firmware update are automatic from the app after you approve the new firmware availability update message i e no complicated step of downloading the firmware file and manually installing like most other peripheral firmware update the user interface is clear simple to use and attractive if you are using this wemo item to reboot a computer remotely and wishing to log back in to be able to log back in after powering down remotely many computer system require that you quickly press the power button on the wemo app again shortly meaning a soon a you see the power button on your wemo app change to power off to keep the computer in an on state allowing you to log back in too if i press the off button the wemo and wait too long the computer will remain in an off state even after the wemo is turned on again meaning you would then have to physically be at the computer and press the computer power button to reboot this is not a wemo issue but an issue with the computer system s bios if that s confusing think of it like this if you wait to long to power back up the wemo it is like you pushed the power off button on your computer if you cycle the wemo off on quickly within one second the computer reacts a if you instead pressed the reset button allowing the computer to remain on so if your cycling of your wemo power is with a goal to log back into your computer remotely if you don t do it quickly you re merely cut the power to your computer by turning off your wemo and the computer will remain off even when the wemo is turned back on from the app and you will be unable to log in remote because the computer will remain off,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
cool thing 1,3.0,there wa a today s deal lightning sale on this it took a bit to get up running because of some wifi issue which wemo acknowledges and tell you the workaround but once it worked well it work cool thing 1 alexa enabled i can tell alexa to turn the switch on and off 2 android app for it i wa enable to have a timer on this thing what would have been cool is if alexa could also turn off the timer but she wa unable to recognize it so i m assuming the record keeping of the timer could only be done from wemo app you enabled it from oh well for the price i paid i m happy with it it s a good starter for somebody who doe not have any smart home appliance experience a it wa easy to use it work and it give me idea on how to alexa enable the house a i move forward with time i ll move forward with other purchase but will start looking for appliance that smart enough to turn themselves on and off via sensor and some minor programming i e turn on the outside light when the sun go down and turn it off at 10 pm,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
nerd heaven when paired with my echo updated 10 27 2017,3.0,sure i could have gone with a remote control wall plug but that would have added another remote control to the pile in my bedroom and i d likely turn on the tv or stereo i could also have gone with one of those clappy device but they ve been around forever and anytime i think of those thing i picture the old lady from the original tv commercial from the 80 s no i have an amazon echo and i want to be able to say alexa turn off the light when i m ready for bed yes i named the device the light my imagination wa bored feel free to post better name in the comment if you can think of any set up wa honestly a easy a the pictograph on the card that come with the device and the instruction you scroll through after installing the wemo app even being disabled and working from a walker plus having to go hunt down the router s password it took maybe ten minute to get up and working with my echo and the switch did a firmware update while i wa in the shower i m in nerd heaven being able to tell my echo to turn on and off my bedroom light that s just too cool update for the most part the last two year have been reasonably problem free tonight for no good reason my wemo switch acted up nothing i could do would resolve thing amazon support ran me in circle it took over an hour and i had to rename my switch it wa a nightmare,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
buy it if you want a cheap frustrating product that simply doesn t work a advertised,1.0,this product simply doesn t work i purchase two one of them i wa able to fully setup and the second one i wa able to setup but could not enable remote access both device became not detected in the wemo app almost immediately after setting them up i restarted my router and reset the device after initally a soft reset and then a hard reset i still wa unable to get them to connect after manually turning on the device they would be detected in the wemo app for a few second enough time for me to quickly turn them and off a few time and then return to the not detected state i have other device connected to my network which work flawlessly including 2 of the amazon echo a nest thermostat and even a wemo insight switch these were very disappointing,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great when they work,3.0,i have two wemo plug in switch and one wemo wall switch one of the plug in switch doesn t work on a broadband connection i ve reset the device several time enabled remote access etc but it still doesn t work read through the amazon review and check out the wemo community board on the internet many complaint and low rating apparently belkin customer service is even worse this is a buggy product find another brand of wireless switch wemo switch are not worth the headache i m returning mine to amazon update well i decided to keep the switch and see if i could get them to work turns out there are a couple of thing that make thing easier first patience it take several minute for these thing to reset for the wall switch you have to push the right button followed immediately for five second until the light begin to flash by the left button both are in the front of the switch toward the bottom on the plug in switch push the button on top while inserting it into the electrical receptive and continue pushing the button until the light begin to blink in both case you then need to wait up to a couple of minute until the light begin to flash alternating color at that point the switch s wifi designation should show up on the network list on your phone connect to the switch then open the belkin wemo app and finish the set up you need to install the app before you try to set up the switch you can t set these thing up on a 802 11ac network it ha to be 892 11n also the network name ssid must be being broadcast i typically don t broadcast the ssid to set up the switch i changed the router setting to broadcast then changed it back to no broadcast after the switch were working another tip although you need the belkin app to set up the switch there is a much better app for controlling them it s available in the google play store i don t know if it s available for ios device look for wemo manager it set up a server on your phone so you don t have to use the belkin server much faster response time and the app developer is wonderful with customer service finally i have an amazon echo and i ve never had a problem with it not recognizing the switch go to the echo app in settings under connected home you can have alexa search for your device sometimes if she s being ornery you may have to ask her to search twice to pick up all of them hope this help i m still giving this product three star the switch get a four belkin s terrible customer service get a zero but i m feeling generous today so overall three star,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
initial setup wa very easy plugged them in,3.0,initial setup wa very easy plugged them in detected right away and i wa able to control my lamp no knock there so far i ve had it for 2 week and i already had one issue where creep up twice the device just show up a not detected by my echo or the wemo app first time i unplugged the wemo plug and plugged them back in and they started working less than 48 hour later they showed up a not detected again the issue i believe wa because my router by default ha multicast routing igmp proxy disabled a well a efficient multicast forwarding igmp snooping as soon a i enabled those my wemo device went from not detected to online and i could control them i am using an asus rt n66u router with the latest firmware a of 9 25 16 3 0 0 4 380_3831 i don t know what other issue will crop up in another 2 week but when they work they are great when they don t work you wonder if it s worth the hassle and expense this is me dipping my toe into home automation and if i have anymore issue with these simple device i ll probably wait another year or two until i invest anymore into any home automation equipment,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i love it and bought another one a well a a,5.0,i bought another brand before buying the belkin and i had to return it a it wa impossible to set up with the belkin i wa able to connect but couldn t quite figure out how to program multiple on off setting one quick call to belkin solved the problem i love it and bought another one a well a a light switch which i have not yet had the chance to install very pleased with the product will most likely buy again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
amazon just make your own home control device because this junk hurt your echo brand,1.0,i could not get this to work with the echo it would constantly drop the wifi connection and the echo never recognized it s existence it wa a a huge let down and hour spent going through customer support and youtube video trying to get this garbage to function i would love to hear from a customer that found a suitable replacement for this piece of junk,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great potential but bad glitch in the app,2.0,this is a product with great potential but unfortunately it software is pretty poor at this point i have an above average capacity for learning and using technology and have had several issue with the glitchy app and firmware when you first get into syncing the app and the outlet it will probably tell you that there are update i updated this thing exactly a the instruction said to it ran the update cycled through the power down that it warns you about and then i restarted it only to get the exact message saying that there is an update i tried to run the update on this like 3 or 4 time following the instruction exactly and it keep thinking that the firmware in the outlet is outdated also it won t let me set rule parameter for the timer function i can get into the menu to create the rule but then it never let me save them saying that it requires an update which i already tried multiple time and that it can t save at this time on top of that every now and then when you try to just use the basic on off function from the phone it will show a yellow circle and not connect for whatever reason this is not a very frequent problem but still annoying sadly the timer fucntion wa the main reason i bought this a my lamp plug in behind a dresser and i wa hoping to avoid messing with a mechanical timer that i would have to constantly lay on the floor and reach under the dresser to change i think this could be a 4 or 5 star product when they iron out the issue with the app but at the moment it s nearly unusable for me,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great with or without alexa make sure you download the correct app,5.0,i bought this to help control light when i cannot easily reach them or cannot get up medical and because it can work with alexa i read the instruction which were somewhat minimal basically download the app and follow the instruction there the important point here is to look at the icon in the instruction and pick that one when you go to the app store i opened my apple app store put in wemo for the search but the one that came up looked different and cost 1 99 the one shown in the pic did not show up at all unfortunately this is not the first time this ha happened to me at the app store but then again i knew what to do i had to go online using my browser put wemo app in the search then select the apple app result and it take you right to the one shown in the set up instruction and it is free don t ask me why set up did not take too long except there wa a firmware update that did take a while to finish just put it down and come back to it i had no problem with alexa identifying and connecting to it using the alexa app under smart home the only problem i had is that i want to tell alexa to turn on the living room light but instead have to say turn on the living room wemo might be a way to change that but there is no direction for that but i am also new to alexa and need to read up more in how to work it i can play music but not much more i found that you can also control the switch through the wemo app there is a big circular computer like button that is the power button press on press off very simple i bought a second one that i plan to put in a different room so i hope that will go well too,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo app need updating otherwise work well,3.0,i love me some smart product so since alexa had a 20 deal i thought why not the device can in a nice package the plug itself is larger than expected sturdy and pair easily with your phone once paired work pretty seamlessly however it almost take over the entire outlet so using another plug on the outlet is difficult i have had a tp link plug and this work better plus it ha ifttt support the wemo app however need work the part of scheduling naming etc of your plug work easy enough unfortunately syncing to ifttt using the device remotely and connecting to an account are much more complicated on this app than on others it make the overall experience pretty buggy i m hoping with the new wemo mini and app improvement will make the experience a lot better,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
easy to use and convenient great for home safety too,5.0,i have owned my echo for a while but hesitated to try the smart home product a i wa not sure which to select this item came up on a deal before christmas and with lot of positive review i thought it wa time to get my foot wet i have 2 unit and have both in use with light set up wa pretty easy with the downloaded app for android some slowness connecting the second unit however nothing major what i love is that i can now turn on light if we go out and i forget to leave one on i love the away mode option with random on and off when we go away this mean a lived in look to the home also what a great add on to our alarm system should if ever go off turning on light would add another incentive for anyone breaking in to just get out great product that i hope work well over time if so going to be one of my better purchase,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
buggy but doe what i need,2.0,12 28 2015 it wa working well for a few week but i found some new glitch i setup mac address dhcp on my router so it would always get the same address but that caused more issue also when i reset my router one day it knocked the wemo offline and i had to do a full setup again 12 5 2015 once or twice a week it stop responding looking at the device there is a flashing light and it need to be rebooted and sometimes reconfigured my motivation behind picking the wemo wa needing a device that would turn on a lamp at sunset but would also interface with my kodi medium player running on a raspberry pi 2 the lamp ha a 40w equivalent cfl that offer enough light for getting around when the main light are off it s also in the room with the tv and if i wa watching a movie i would get up and turn off light manually being the lazy tinkerer that i am i wanted a way to automate the light kodi ha a plugin for wemo that will turn the wemo light off and on based on playback setup right away i wa unable to complete the setup it wa not connecting well to my wireless i tried their listed troubleshooting even gave customer service a call but wa offered nothing beyond the troubleshooting i already tried i finally figured out it wa my guest wireless network that wa causing the problem having two strong signal at 2 4 ghz wa causing a conflict once i turned off the guest network setup wa easy even after the setup i wa unable to enable my guest network without killing the wemo i now have my guest network on only the 5ghz band and this is not causing a problem i offered this solution to belkin customer service but the guy in india i wa talking to did not understand what i wa talking about function it work a advertised and the app is easy to use i m only using this with one wemo device in the house but overall i m very happy with it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
avoid,2.0,smart plug will eventually setup but is predisposed to lose network connectivity also response time from when a command is given and the light switch on or off is excessive this contrast sharply with the tp link smart plug which maintains connectivity and ha lightening fast response both smart plug require a 2 4 ghz network though your cell phone can remain on a 5 ghz network when controlling the plug both plug support alexa well,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works but the insight switch may be worth the extra money security tbd,3.0,the device wa properly labelled with it mac address simplifying use on a wifi network that doe not broadcast it ssid and that us mac filtering to restrict access the app ha a feature to save network setting to simplify successive device setup where to the cloud just the phone the setting include security type and password this is a significant security breach if the data is anywhere other than the phone or the wifi switch nothing tell you where it is saved nor how to direct that it be forgotten there have been time where the app ha not had access to the switch e g if unplug replug the wemo switch briefly re enabling ssid broadcast can leave mac address filter in place might help with that but it may also be coincidental with time moving forward and some software action in the background that the user is not aware of the insight switch seems to be quieter when toggling power and though chunky is smaller in the sense of not being a tall,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo app is a nightmare,1.0,wemo switch i m giving this one star because although they do work the app and the setup is a nightmare i purchase 2 of these to use with my amazon echo and no the echo is not the problem 1 the wemo app is crap it only a few step but getting the app to find the device and your router is very difficult 2 if you have a android phone you have to disable wi fi setting so the app can get through the second step and if your successful the first try good for you 3 i had to run the setup several time for each device to get mine to work 1 to 1 5 hour 4 after all that and you finally get your device connected the app will ask you to update the device firmware witch i thought at the time would be a good thing the only problem is when it start the update it only found the 1st device and never try to update the 2nd after it finish the app will ask you every time you open it to update firmware i m afraid to unplug 1 device to get them both updated they may not work when i plug them back in note like all electronic device always use a surge protector a brown out or storm could fry your investment,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great product when paired with an amazon echo,4.0,i ve ready many review of belkin s wemo product which were not all that flattering i too had some issue a few year back but i have to say that a lot of these bug have been squashed since 2013 as for the many other issue that are current 2016 i have been fortunate to not have them i decided to pick up the switch smart plug to supplement my amazon echo which so far ha been great setting up the device didn t go the first time but a quick unplug and start the process over took care of it the needed wemo app needed to set up ha much matured in the backend but the user interface ha pretty much remained the same it s easy to use and not difficult to get around for the most part you set it an forget it i ve had a few wemo device running for over a year and i haven t had any issue so i m hoping the switch will do the same it s my opinion that while on it s own work wonderfully especially on vacation mode or simply setting timer for daily cycle it s further enhanced when paired with the amazon echo essentially giving it the ability to use voice command this pair i would highly recommend as for an individual product it doe well but it s still a bit pricey for a switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
doesn t work well with alexa half the time alexa,2.0,doesn t work well with alexa half the time alexa won t recognize it then you ask her 5 min later and it work needs some updating,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
potentially nice product ruined by terrible app,2.0,this could would should be a nice product sadly the app make this product bad if not downright unusable for most people it is riddled with lock ups crash poorly designed ui and even force you to relaunch the app to setup device the setup process is just a tutorial it took a ridiculous amount of try on multiple device to get this to work fortunately once your device are discovered and setup it seems to work pretty well and flawlessly with amazon s alexa my tip use an older device or rather older version of android with an older version of the app so if you re using an amazon tablet for once amazon s delay in updating android version and app version is in your favor belkin have done a terrible job not only with giving needed update but also giving update that actually make the app better or more usable frankly if i were to buy another smart outlet it would be another tp link while the plug is not a pretty a the wemo a it at least work without any problem and they have done a very good job with their app furthermore they are generally a couple dollar cheaper tp link wi fi smart plug works with amazon alexa controls your electronics from anywhere hs100,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
won t connect to network,2.0,i have multiple other wemo device that work just fine but the two of these i got on the bf special will absolutely not connect to my network i ve tried different router and different phone both android and iphone 7 and i figure an hour of messing around with them to no avail is enough update i had a friend that ha zero wemo device try to set up and he wa successful and able to update the firmware which then allowed me to connect to my network clearly you don t want it talking to other device if the firmware are not in sync what a pita,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
fun cool but necessary,4.0,i installed this once and it worked ok but i had to move it because i wanted something else plugged into it after moving it i could not get it to link to my wifi nor alexa i had to call the company because there were no troubleshooting instruction of what to do if xyz happens the girl on the phone walked me very slowly and deliberately through the whole process of rebooting the plug and getting it set up easy peezy then wish that had been in the direction a i could have done it myself have not had a problem ever since and i have even lost my internet connection several time since due to weather etc i do wonder though how is this really any different or better than a run of the mill timer cons it s big take up 1 2 a normal sized power strip or an entire outlet difficult to reboot pros love telling alexa to turn on and off,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great in general but need reset every week or two,3.0,i bought this to work with my amazon echo and to voice control one lamp the setup wa pretty easy but you need to follow the instruction once set up alexa can control the switch there is maybe a one second delay but that s fine i really like the switch but it just loses connection every one or two week and i need to reset the device and start all over this is somewhat frustrating also it will not detect or connect to your 5g home wireless it still work even when alexa is on the 5g but i have no idea how but here is what i did connect to wemo switch using your phone it will ask for a wifi i gave it my 2 4g wifi network and password i have time warner and both network come with the router once it connected there the app switched me back to my 5g wifi on the phone for whatever reason alexa wa also able to find and control the light even though it should be on a different network so yeah no idea how it work but it doe i hope that make sense just bought a second switch but from a different seller this one i could not make work at all for whatever reason it doe not connect to the network and keep timing out with password incorrect for my wifi i tried on both ios and android reset the switch a few time but no success hoping that belkin support can help update belkin support wa really great they called me and we did troubleshooting over the phone my issue second switch cannot connect to wifi wa resolved by unplugging the first switch during the setup of the seconomy switch everything work properly now very happy and huge thank you to belkin support,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great once set up is done,4.0,i have 2 of these controlling different light in my home via echo they work great once you get them set up however the direction are lacking and setup is not a easy a it could be i would have given 5 star had instruction been better i had to google to find answer to some of my question and i actually found the answer in amazon review not the wemo website one thing i wa unaware of wa how to reset the switch one of the switch stopped working and i simply could not get it to pair with my amazon echo after researching online it wa recommended to reset the switch and restart the pairing process the reset restore button is on the very top of the switch above the pair button and light here are the direction to restore once i figured this out i can quickly get the plug repaired when needed fyi i have only had to do this 2 time so it is not frequent that they go down here are the reset instruction step 1 unplug your wemo step 2 hold down the restore button labeled on the top step 3 while holding the restore button down plug the wemo into a power outlet and continue to hold the button down for at least 15 second step 4 release the restore button it should take about 45 second for the wemo to restore and reboot it will blink blue and amber when finished,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
this is not a finished product,2.0,this is not a finished product it is completely hit or miss a to whether it will work and is very finicky depending on your network hardware setting etc in troubleshooting support will tell you thing like you need to remove any special character from your wifi key and make sure your router is on channel 1 or 9 what kind of device force you to re architect your network around them i had one of these that actually worked well when i first installed it so i bought a second one that second one work locally but will not pair with my amazon echo or work from outside my home network it ha been very frustrating i ve spent probably 6 hour troubleshooting it and talking to their support and am about ready to give up and ship it back it s probably the first time i ve had to do that normally with enough finagling i can get these type of thing working anyway i do not recommend this product and eagerly await something more stable hitting the market belkin and wemo should be ashamed of themselves for selling this a it is,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
incredibly convenient,5.0,we have had two of these for about 6 month now and just got our third they are easy to set up read the direction first though set up is not completely intuitive they function well we have never had a failure to function and work with multiple device and platform we use the iftt software and alexa to do thing like light turn on at sunrise light turn on when alexa alarm go off light turn on or off when our cell phone connect or disconnect from our wifi we re arriving or leaving home and of course we use alexa to verbally turn the light on or off if the wifi on off system doesn t work it s always worked but if someone else leaf our house after we have for instance we can easily use the app on our phone to make sure electricity is not being wasted the app also allows u to set up vacation mode so it appears a if we are home when we are not we are now entertaining getting more for thing other than light might even get their crock pot,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the belkin wemo switch is simple easy and it integrates flawlessly with the amazon echo,5.0,set up and use of this smart plug is flawless the belkin wemo app is simple and the set up instruction are quick and easy to follow once the smart plug is set up it can be turned on and off through the app anywhere there is an internet connection my favorite part is that you can add photo and a name to each plug this is the device of this type that i have owned so i can t compare it to others like it but i can t image any other being much better the wemo switch also work perfectly with the amazon echo and there wa virtually no set up alexa automatically detected the device and i can turn it on or off by name depending on your budget they aren t exactly cheap but once you realize the benefit and convenience of owning a smart device it s worth it i have already purchased a second one and i plan on adding more smart device to my home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

update at 4 month out,5.0,i love these i wa concerned about them loosing connectivity or just not working properly i have now installed 7 of them throughout my house and 4 month later they are all working wonderfully i have had zero problem with them they can be a little finicky to install but then they are golden i would still highly recommend i plan to update again in a few month my original review from early december 2015 is below i ordered one of these to operate my living room floor lamp it took a small amount of time following the included instruction and following online advice from some reputable source after that it wa a piece of cake i have gotten two more to use echo to turn on and off the christmas tree the floor lamp and now a table lamp so cool and the kid love it the last one i had set up and in the system in mere minute the wemo switch is a great product it ha definitely enhanced our amazon echo and no more trying to find the lamp switch in the dark now we just use a voice command to turn it on i finally feel like we are living in the future i also love that i can use them independently with the echo without having to purchase a separate hub like most other product require i did get one that i had to return because it came dead on arrival but i think that wa more an issue with the third party seller than the product and amazon promptly refunded my money so i could get a replacement so far i am very pleased,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo works,4.0,i have four of these in my house and let me just say they work the only issue i have is that i can t really find a whole lot of use for them when i m not away on vacation my house isn t huge but am i really at a stage of laziness that i can t get up to turn a light switch versus sitting on the couch and doing it from an app thankfully no the app ha become better and better a time go by which show an active support from belkin in making sure it doesn t become an antique the android app even ha a widget toggle button now what can sometimes be helpful is to set up static ip address for each plug so that if you lose power your router will find them more easily it s also compatible with many voice control system good product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
warning for galaxy s4 galaxy note owner,3.0,warning for galaxy s4 galaxy note owner the wemo android app may not work on those device for the initial set up i bought the wemo switch this week so i could remotely control a heat lamp for a rescue cat who recently adopted me i am often away from home in winter and don t leave any heat on in my home which the cat us via a cat door this switch sounded like a great idea and after reading about the incredibly easy setup i wa anticipating getting this up and running in no time after about 4 hour of incredibly frustrating trial and error trying to set this up i finally threw in the towel and called belkin support the customer service rep had me repeat everything i had already done which wa basically just to follow the direction but to no avail finally she asked me what kind of phone i wa using and when i said it wa a galaxy s4 she put me on hold for a few minute then came back on and asked if i could use a different phone huh no it s the only phone i own she then told me there wa an issue with the setup being run from an s4 and if i could find a different phone to do the setup with i then shouldn t have any problem using my s4 to operate it so that night i borrowed my girlfriend s iphone and ran the setup it got past the point where my s4 had been failing starting the app after connecting the wemo wifi signal did nothing but show me the setup instruction over and over again but failed to activate the remote control after a bunch more trial and error i found that i had to change my wifi router setting it didn t like wpa2 security with tkip and aes so i changed it to wpa2 with aes only and it finally worked i then tried operating it with my s4 and it worked fine now that it s finally set up it work great i have a foscam ip camera in the room where the cat sleep so i can log on remotely and see if he s there then pan over to a thermometer to see how cold it s getting if it s getting cold i turn on the heat lamp for him it s great fun this is a great little device that so far is working flawlessly and if setup had been a easy a all the advertising said it wa going to be i d be giving this 5 star but it wa a royal pain in the a to set up mostly because belkin failed to provide a decent set of instruction with an explanation of known setup issue and incompatibility with certain device had they communicated those issue to me i couldn t even find it in their faq or troubleshooting section of the website it would have saved me a lot of time and frustration hopefully they ll resolve this issue with a new version of the app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
starting smart,5.0,i ve been wanting to make my home smart however i rent i didn t want to invest in hardwired item switch and plug that i would either leave behind or uninstall and replace everything i wanted something easy to take with me as i looked at different option i found that almost all item needed a bridge that s when i came across wemo i purchased a single switch for my bedroom light i also purchased an amazon echo dot the wemo came first and wa easy to set up and using it alone wa simple i downloaded the app plugged it in and turned my bedside light on and off from my phone when i m not home for a while i turn it on off to give the appearance someone is home when echo arrived it wa also very simple to integrate the two now i can either tell alexa to control it when i m home and still have the remote ability a well my only issue is the profile it s a rather large so when you plug an item in it will protrude out quite a bit so don t plan to push any furniture flush to the wall it s a small sacrifice for the convenience i m looking forward to adding to my wemo collection to increase my home automation it delivers at a great price point no need for a bridge and compatible with any smart phone and echo definitely deserves consideration if you are stayingt home automation but don t can t purchase expensive starter pack i would recommend to family friend,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well once it s finally configured be patient,4.0,i bought two of these discounted in a deal of the day promotion they work well and i would have given them five start except they are not a easy to configure a indicated i use android device and they had an annotation on the instruction sheet to take specific step to disable certain network action while configuring the device the instruction on their web site did not match the current android configuration short story is plan to call wemo customer service to get help with configuration i am quite computer savvy but in this case i needed help,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

a gadget that turns your cell phone into a remote light switch and more,5.0,as a security system i purchased 3 of these device because i wanted to be able to remotely turn 3 separate lamp on and off with a cell phone application app when my family and i are not at home for one or more day this switch come with a quick installation guide however it wa over simplistic for my taste accordingly here is how i installed the device 1 i plugged the lamp into an outlet and manually turned it on 2 i plugged in the wemo switch to my wall outlet and plugged the lamp cord into the wemo switch 3 i opened the play store app on my samsung cell phone and typed in wemo on the search engine selected bekin s free app downloaded it to my cell phone installed it and moved the wemo icon to my cell phone home page 4 i selected the settings app on my cell phone turned off my bluetooth setting and turned on my wi fi setting 5 i tapped the wi fi icon again to view all available wi fi network and waited for my wap wireless access point to locate wemo device software 6 still viewing my wi fi setting screen on my cell phone i selected the wemo network 7 next i selected the wemo icon on my cell phone homepage and waited for it to notify me that the wemo switch wa connected to my wap and then selected the program option to save those installation setting 8 i followed the same procedure to install my other 2 wemo device to my wap and cell phone and then selected the option to install the latest update for the app the wemo app come with a drop down menu list that includes o edit device o setup instructions o remote access o connect to ifttt if this then that programming o tell us what you think o help center o settings about when you open the wemo app there is an icon for each wemo switch and a place containing the name of each device that can be edited from the drop down menu at the top of the screen to the right of the name of the device is an icon depicting an on off button touch that icon and it becomes circled and highlighted in green indicating that the associated electrical device plugged into the wemo switch my lamp ha been turned on touch it again and the button icon change to gray and black indicating that you turned the lamp switch off currently listed at 39 99 each these device may seem a bit pricey however my remote use of them a a home security system make them very cost effective over the long haul when compared to an alternative home security service additionally when it is dark outside it is very convenient to turn the light on from a remote location and not have to stumble around turning light on in an otherwise dark home i am thrilled with this product and bet you will too,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
does what i need it to do,5.0,we have 6 of these and love them they help u turn on the light when we are out of town and turn them off if we are in bed and don t want to get up we use them for lamp in our room and by the front door it make it look like you are home when you re not and allows you to come home to a house that isn t in complete darkness if your internet isn t the best sometimes these wont show up in your app so make sure you have the streaming available to do everything you want to do i have had a few of these for over a year bought 2 new one to expand my collection a bit bulky but doe what i want it to do,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i would not recommend this product,2.0,well what can i say i wanted to like this and this is the first smart home plug i have ever owned i wa using it through my echo from the start it wa trouble like a new puppy peeing everywhere this plug just would not cooperate it would take it time to switch on and the same with switching off sometimes it would not do either at all now i did think to myself that maybe it alexa that is being the bad doggie but no i also have two of these tp link wi fi smart plug works with amazon alexa controls your electronics from anywhere hs100 and they work flawlessly now a i have said i am new to smart home technology but after giving this plug approx 10 day to make itself at home i had to give up i would not recommend this product not sure if it just my house a it doe get some great review but it certainly did not work for me pity,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
we have a different switch for our living room light and that when you actually say alexa turn off the living room light so i fi,5.0,i purchase this in a bundle with the wemo switch for my husband who ha been complaining that our bedroom light is not on the alexa lol the first day we received it he said it up immediately by plugging it into the outlet and then downloaded an application for his phone which help you control it and sync it up to your amazon echo within minute he had it up and running however when alexis search for it even though it s listed a bedroom light you can t just tell alexa to turn off the bedroom light you have to tell her to turn off the quote unquote light we have a different switch for our living room light and that when you actually say alexa turn off the living room light so i find this to be a little weird however we only have one switch right now so if that s fine though it may pose a problem when we have multiple switch have them to the location,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
awesome when it work,4.0,i use this in conjunction with alexa it work great when it s working i don t know whether to blame the alexa app or the wemo app every once in a while alexa will say sorry i couldn t find a device or group named _______ in your account in the alexa app it say offline for that particular device however i can still control it manually through the wemo app which show that it s still connected to my wifi this make me believe it s more of an alexa issue but i m no tech wiz trying to forget the device in the alexa app and then trying to discover new device doe not work after a period of time usually the next day everything is working fine again i would definitely have given 5 star if it were not for this glitch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
2 wemo device for several year and have been happy with them,2.0,i own 2 wemo device for several year and have been happy with them i bought 2 more to use at different location and could not set them up when i called technical support for the product they advised that you could not control device at different location with the same ios or android app has something to do with the wifi setup they said so you can control your wemos from anywhere it seems but not when they are in multiple location unless you control there with different cellphone or tablet for each location a rather poor and unexpected product limitation i d say the 2 new one i bought need to go back because of this,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the future of home automation are you kidding me,2.0,succeeded in connecting this plug switch to the wemo network got to the point where the wifi credential are entered in the app and down the hill from there the app could never complete the setup due to loosing connection yet it look like the switch itself might have acquired the setting because it would stop advertising it own wemo network however it could not be located on the network that it wa getting connected to reset repeat same thing spent 30 minute with belkin s tech support to no avail was told it must be a hardware problem returning with no plan to replace the android app by the way is atrocious wrote a separate review on that in the play store beware consumer this is a beta product you are considering two start because it doe work a a dumb outlet switch at least you got that piece working belkin,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
simple design and so many us,5.0,i bought this little guy almost three year ago when it wa still cutting edge i paid a pretty penny for it and debated quite a bit a i wondered it it would really be worth while or if it wa just an extravagant indulgence these type of switch are an indulgence but i will say i ve used this far more often than i would have expected and it s still going strong i m pleased i purchased it and am back to buy a few more one of my favorite us is the sunset timer with a traditional timer plug you have to specify the exact hour it will turn on and off with this i can set the time via the app on my iphone to auto adjust you can use an offset too based on the sunset i ve used this with decorative christmas tree lava lamp fairy light in lantern hard to reach switch etc i love that i can set up rule to turn it on and off and not have to worry about it i ve never had any problem with either the switch or the app this is a well designed product and easy to use app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
excellent,5.0,i love these thing have them about the house with various light fixture have no problem been able to turn light on off from 2000 mile away i know i had a friend in the house to check only thing to drive you crazy is first use there must be four plus downloads of upgrade to the device and that take time bit of an update while on vacation i received a notice on my app that a firmware update wa available now being over 1 000 mile from home i had a concern but did the download anyway and to my surprise and gratification all went off well i had a friend stop by just to see if the lamp connected did go on off and complete success some may have issue but these work well for me i use an iphone 5 with latest os,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
very nice but a bit slow,4.0,a very good plug quite large but i m sure that will be changed a the technology develops firmware upgrade wa needed immediately and hung for quite some time but eventually installed there is an audible click when turning it on and off via wifi which most likely ha to do with the physical switch works well my amazon echo but is very slow i have lifx wifi bulb that turn on off with 1 second delay usually not even noticeable the wemo switch will take anywhere form 3 10 second on average,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great now needs to be at a better price point and i will buy more need to better communicate firmware download status,4.0,if a company could mfg and sell these thing for 10 15 a piece i believe they would sell ton more while the convenience of this device is nice the actual value in comparison to the cost is not there to friend and relative you look lazy when you spend 30 40 to get one of these if it wa 10 15 you would look smart and they would want one a well that being said this device work great now when i first purchased it i connected it to an outlet installed the app on my phone connected from the phone to this switch and got it on my wifi similar to setting up a chrome cast but the similarity would end there once on my wifi the app on my phone would find the switch and when i went to configure it the app told me that the firmware on the switch needed updated that made sense to me a the switch had probably been on a shelf due to price point and many firmware version had probably been released since it wa originally programmed so naturally you would tap the upgrade firmware button right i tried several time however the button wa grayed out a if something else needed to be completed before it could be tapped so i looked for indication that something else needed to be done i found nothing not in the manual not in the app i did go online and found many others complaining about the same thing and lot who just sent it back i decided to check the mfg page and see what i could find there it took me some time but i found an article that suggested that the switch itself that once connected to the wifi would go out and download the firmware on it own and that this could take some time that seemed to fit the scenario that i wa in so i decided to reset the switch to default and start again this time when i got to the app notification about the firmware and i let the switch sit plugged in i left it this way for several hour incase the download wa large i checked back and nothing still no update i got frustrated uninstalled the app and intended to return the switch a defective the switch stayed plugged in for about 3 day and i decided to give it one more shot this time i installed the app on the phone it found the switch and lo and behold the firmware update button wa not grayed out i tapped it the switch updated rebooted and ha been working fine ever since it seems the disconnect is communicating firmware device status from the switch to the app had i known it wa doing something i would have let it sit and attempted to update when the status indicated the firmware had downloaded being that there wa no indication of download status i wa left to believe nothing wa happening,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not so easy to set up,3.0,this is my first smart home device the first time i set it up it said that it failed to connect and then after that the wemo wireless network i wa supposed to connect to in order to set it up wa no longer available i had to look up online how to reset the device then i went through the process again and i got the same error message wemo ha lost contact with your device but then i went on and sure enough it was connected after all after that the device worked perfectly i then enabled the wemo skill for alexa and linked the two together that process went through without a hitch i am now able to turn the lamp plugged into the switch on and off by speaking to my spot however the instruction included with this device were laughably inadequate i think perhaps the idea is to not give you much instruction a a way of suggesting that this thing is brain dead easy to hook up but it didn t work for me and i had to go online to belkin s website and search for the device then search the faqs in order to find out how to reset it and start over there wa no help available in the wemo app on my iphone either i would have been a lot more impressed if there had been a page of instruction on how to set it up along with a troubleshooting link straight to the right page on their website to solve problem with it having to go to the belkin website and search for the troubleshooting instruction wa clunky most people might not bother why is it that so many thing you buy today force you to do research on the internet just to use them what s wrong with written instruction i will come back and update my review after a couple of week to see if the device stay connected meanwhile based on this one experience i would be inclined to look at other brand for my next smart device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

cool toy,4.0,i bought a couple of these switch one is used to turn on a lamp in my living room at sundown and off at bedtime works great and i have it connected to my amazon echo so can use my voice to turn it on or off manually the second one is in the kitchen and i use it to turn on a mini crockpot an hour before i get up so it will cook my oatmeal that s great except the wi fi doesn t connect reliably where i want to use it the signal is good for my phone but the antenna in the wemo switch isn t a good i guess so i have the crock pot set up at a le desirable outlet so if you are going to use these consider how far they are from your router they are great but not infallible,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

straightforward installation and work a advertised but not entirely happy with the app,4.0,i bought this to replace a orbivo switch which would work in the home on our network but would not work when away from home on other network i bought one in the us to operate a light there a a trial and it worked fine when at home on our network and when on public network so when we came back to the uk i bought this and set it up set up wa relatively easy and it is working well except that in setting the app up on my phone it search for device on your network first of all and wipe out access to other device you may have on other network so i have lost access to the wemo in the us which is disappointing i had expected that once i had a dece connected to the app it would stay there anyway the device in the uk work well on all network i suppose that i can set up another wemo account on a different device maybe a tablet when we get back to the us but that complicates matter my application well my power company require monthly gas reading so i set up a cheap camera and light in the meter cupboard to turn on when a meter is required i then note down the digit and turn off the light and camera time they had a remote way of reading the gas meter a they already do with the electric meter,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
because i have discovered that the wemo switch doe not work good with the rule,3.0,i m modifying my rating from 5 star to 3 because i have discovered that the wemo switch doe not work good with the rule i have worked with tech support and followed several of the post on belkin s support page and i can get one rule working but not both belkin support continues to ask you to jump through a 8 to 12 step reset process and then re setup and reprogram the device to get it to work that process did work for the first rule but the second rule still fails even if it worked the fact that this is what is considered a normal procedure for any time you add a rule or make a change to your wireless router is insane the device work great with amazon echo but i m hoping they fix the rule problem and wifi change problem asap if not i will be buying the tp link device next they have much better rating,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great device controlling greenhouse light,5.0,easy to understand setup i just had a problem get it connected to my network my ipad saw it fine but the network connect step with password entry never appeared moved closer to router and i breezed through setup and i wa up and running quickly the switch is actually located farther away and through a wall away from the spot my first setup failed to connect with the router i have it controlling a grow light in the greenhouse it come on 30 minute before sunset and then turn off later in the evening also if it is a real cloudy dark day i can turn the light on from wherever i am with my ipad or iphone it work fine with amazon echo alexa turn on the greenhouse light okay now the test of time will be the final trial,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
but there are worse thing in life,4.0,wemo switch it is bulky so it does cover the other outlet this is the reason for 4 star instead of 5 but there are worse thing in life and hey i am able to turn stuff on and off remotely also it is compatible with echo alexa so overall i would recommend this product wemo light switch it took me a while to install it because i needed to buy wire connector or so i thought apparently it come with wire connector so i hate myself for wasting time and money the video instruction were very helpful i installed it myself with no problem it suck though that i wa able to install it only in the kitchen which ha a neutral wire required but could not install it in the hallway because for some reason that location doe not have a neutral wire too bad that wa my first location choice again it is compatible with echo alexa so overall i would recommend this product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i have several of these and wa initially very pleased with them,2.0,i have several of these and wa initially very pleased with them but now they are becoming more and more unreliable do not connect to anything that you are depending on they become non functioning with the app indicating not detected if the switch is on when it go out it remains on and the manual button will not function if they are off when they malfunction they will remain off and the manual button will not function i have sent problem report to belkin and hoping they will resolve these issue but i am not optimistic the idea is great but the execution is not there regardless of what is said it ha nothing to do with your wifi or the distance from your router i have checked all aspect of this notion ps to get them up and running again just unplug from power source and plug back in you do not have to factory reset them and go through the activation process all over again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good but not great,3.0,got this on sale but wished i would have waited for one of the mini s currently have 4 of the plug and one switch overall i like the concept but the product could use some improvement to keep up with competition easy to set up and i like the app and the set up for the vacation mode for when we travel also like the capability of accessing via alexa some of the draw back are that the switch only work on a single plug and not a multi switch set up also would like to see the ability to use plug on different network but with the same app right now i can t use these in our vacation home unless i set them up on a different ios device can t use just one device for both location,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
very nice switch to easily automate your home,4.0,this the third one of these i have bought i m still an infant when it come to the whole connected home thing but i am happy with these switches they work really well and they allowed me to automate a couple of lamp and a radiator the lamp turn on when i wake up and off 5 minute after i leave for work and the radiator turn on 1 hour before i wake up to keep my bathroom toasty for when i jump in the shower setup is really easy through the wemo app and because they connect to your wifi the can be controlled from anywhere from your phone which is a big plus and they do not need a hub to work which is nice also the wemo app used to be buggy but there have been several update in the last year or so that have made the app much more stable which is nice you can set up basic rule like on off at a given time or day of the week and you can also create rule with ifttt although their effectiveness is somewhat hit and miss i had a rule to turn on my light at dusk but after a while they either came on way too early or late enough that i wa already too dark in my home to see comfortably another minor annoyance is how big those thing are i have seen some new smart switch announced in ces that essentially should do the same thing and they are easily half the size which mean they don t stand out a much big and bulky is not something i like in my technology at least not in tech like this which is supposed to work behind the scene so to speak and not be obvious or apparent that you even have it on the plus side of ifttt wemo switches are now compatible with a whole host of other connected device such a the nest thermostat so that you can create rule that for example allow you to turn on or off light and at the same time rise or lower the temperature in your home based on certain parameter you set this is very cool but in my opinion it is still in it infancy ifttt rule are often not very flexible and i hope that in the future they ll become a lot more useful and flexible all in all i really like these switch i will like them even more if they can make them smaller and if there is better result when using ifttt rule,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great device will buy more,5.0,this device is great i don t understand why it get the bad rep here on amazon if your network is configured properly you patiently set up the device and you don t stick this on something that s a mile away from your router you ll be fine i use this for my window air conditioner a i unfortunately do not have a home with central air i can turn my air conditioner on an hour or so before i get home and my place is pleasantly cool when i arrive going to purchase 1 or 2 more to set up something similar i haven t experienced any issue and setup wa easy plug it in get the app on your device and when you run through the setup and are connected for the first time it ll ask you to update the firmware it ha to go through i believe 3 set of firmware to be fully up to date it load the firmware reboots and then when you reopen then app on your phone device it ll find another one this took about 10 15 minute with me just sitting on my couch a it updated it s easy i ve also seen some complaint that there s a lag with turning it on via the app to when the switch kick on there is a 2 3 second lag when you are connected via your mobile carrier which is understandable there is a 0 second lag when you are hooked up to your home wi fi on the same network these are on so not sure what the issue is there some people might just be nit picking,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
be prepared for a wrestling match during initial setup,3.0,if you are one of the lucky one this will work out of the box for you however if you are like what seems like 99 of the population getting this to work for the first time will be a nightmare it took me over an hour and i m very tech savvy being a software engineer who wired his entire home 1gbps home network my only suggestion is to make sure you do the initial configuration in the same room a your router once you have it on your network and connected to your phone and once you can use your phone to turn it on and off then take the time to upgrade the firmware before you move it to your desired destination outlet one more thing these device do not seem to do well in those low signal wi fi spot in your home that are farthest from your router,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
can be difficult to set up,3.0,i have 6 wemo s when they work they work well they are not 100 locked in and in that you are at the mercy of any switch being grayed out till it becomes recognized again this can take a bit they are difficult to set up if you have more than one wifi in use i have a wifi repeater using the same password 100 foot away from my house and this is where my solid connection problem are the app ha recently been updated and i noticed a few improvement but they need to get on with even better firmware belkin need to attach a login port so you can set up use with more than one tablet or smart phone i m scared to try to use it that way for fear i will make all of the switch drop off resetting the switch to make new setting is cumbersome it involves unplugging the switch and then re plugging it while holding the top button a little more than a one hand operation let go of the button when the light turn solid orange and wait for the light to flash blue orange then search for the switch in your wifi with your phone or tablet the process is time consuming and doe not assure success so the process ha to be repeated till you see it show up in the app as you can see i have done this many time the more switch you have the more difficult they are to install a you add to the app nice concept but still ha bug to be worked out belkin if you are reading this get on with the firmware upgrade and a website with login would be a nice improvement thanks for upgrading the app a little please don t stop with the upgrade note i had some issue setting these up i finally decided to uninstall the app on my iphone and start over that wa a big plus be sure to install the firmware and wait to install all of your switch before you try the setting up rule for them i have been able to use them away from home they function over 3 4g network but work better over wifi,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it work,2.0,update after two month it ha stopped working took support 3 full day to help me and they were slow even though i told them i did all the step they took a day to come back with all the step and asked me to do them again then i get to level 2 and they start over with the same result i am getting a replacement but i have to pay to ship the unit back and i will be down at least 1 2 week day 4 already and i am just shipping the unit back not acceptable i have another unit on order from another manufacture and this will most likely be the last belkin item i purchase end of update works perfect with home assistant it wa easy to configure with the app then once it is named it wa discovered by home assistant and then could be added to a group and automated will be purchasing more,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well,4.0,i have 2 of these and one of their switch all 3 are connected to an amazon echo dot setting this device up is extremely easy downloading and installing the app probably took longer just have the wemo app ready plug the device in and connect to the device s wifi through the app you then have it connect to your home wifi through the app and you re done you can control the device at home or remotely with the app you can also schedule time for it to go on off to connect to the dot wa even easier you can do it through the alexa app smart device or just ask for it to search for smart device whatever you named it in the wemo app is what you verbally say to turn off or on ie kitchen light bedroom light etc,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
rocky start but seems to be working reliably,5.0,so setting this up turned out to be a bit of a hassle for me an hour and a half of waiting for a firmware update resulted in a midnight call to belkin but the matter wa resolved promptly and professionally and i even recieved a follow up call today to make sure it wa still working so customer service is top notch the switch seems to work reliably i m intending on using this one for for christmas light during the holiday i currently have candy corn light plugged into it and it work reliably and quickly using it with an amazon echo work well too though there is a it of a lag at time more so than with other smart home device i have but it s barely noticeable all and all a very good product with awesome customer support,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good product,4.0,this wa my first purchase from belkin i always thought belkin product were the most expensive one on the shelf which is why i always avoided buying belkin product i bought this only because it wa one of the cheapest product in it class i liked the product i must say i am actually surprised by the amount of ve feebback this product ha my installation wa very straight forward it wasn t quick but very straight forward considering the amount of activity on the device while installation it wasn t supposed to be quick bottom line is follow instructions it wa a interactive installation don t expect it to be seamless and that is how it should be the device after all is accessing your local area network once installation wa complete the reaction time of on off action from my cell phone app to the device wa amazing i wa actually surprised by how quick the device response time wa both from iphone android from local area network or from another wifi network from 3g or 4g it worked without a glitch looks are good too my only beef is which is why 4 star is this device can also act a a hub for wifi enabled bulb belkin should promote that this may be intentional by belkin to sell their hub which is no state of the art compared to wink or smartthings i discovered that after a lot of digging dont expect this switch to be a magical hub it will be with least ability now if i just want a couple of wifi bulb and a power switch in my household i can do that within 100 buck pros in it class it is the cheapest device response time thru lan non lan 3g or 4g is brilliant looks nice cons installation took some time not seamless which i guess is justified you have to be careful in each and every step is also a hub but the fact is not promoted,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
pesky device,2.0,this device and app need some work here are my comment 1 seems pricey for an electrical switch but i wanted a piece of electronics that my amazon echo can talk to it can 2 if i lose power or unplug it it need to be set up all over again it is not obvious how to reset this thing even though it ha a restore button there is really no user manual so i can t tell what the blinking light blue or amber mean finally found a web page that tell me how to reset 3 when the device is offline and you open up the app it will ask you what device you are setting up and give you several wemo product option e g setting up a light switch crockpot etc except this one product how dumb 4 my app tell me to download the newest version of firmware but it never work it try for about 30 minute and then basically destroys any connection you have had which brings you back to the beginning which brings you back to my 2nd comment very frustrating customer support told me wait a few day as long a it is working i don t think i ll do anything with firmware unless they send me an email no case number nothing just try again in a few day no thank you 5 i am pretty experienced with computer technology but i have spent way too much time on this for such a simple plug if i can t set up and maintain simple plug please have my head examined for thinking about purchasing the more complicated product like a light switch 6 i expected much better from this company i do like belkin 7 on the positive my amazon echo can find this device and i can turn off the lamp with my voice my goodness i love technology but i guess i am so lazy that i will spend this much money on a plug switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great when they worked not so much when they fail,1.0,the wemo switch is great when it work but after a few month each one of them becomes unable to connect to the home network i really enjoyed being able to turn off light from bed and to be able to turn on off christmas tree light without crawling under the pine needle to operate light remotely illuminating my home a i return home in the evening rather than entering a dark house perhaps the app update don t support the prior generation equipment i don t know why i am unable to restore my 4 wemo switch to operating order but the technology is not so sophisticated that it should be so unreliable i ll be looking for a more reliable replacement for remote control of a few key light in my home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works exactly a expected but pricey,4.0,if you re dabbling in home automation this is a great start the belkin app work well and you can switch it on or off anywhere you have internet access even better if you re even reasonably technically inclined check out the app ifttt if this than that on your smartphone which will let you toggle the switch based on thing like e mail received temperature stock price your location etc i have mine turn on a lamp in my front window when i enter my neighborhood since we don t have street light and the house is hard to find i deducted one star because the smartphone app should do that itself and because the unit is pricey sure comparable unit are comparably priced but that s no excuse belkin i ve come to rely on you for quality electronics at good price so knock off a few buck and start taking over the home automation space,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not ready for prime time but,3.0,i wanted to give this one star due to wemo s very buggy software but decided that wouldn t be fair because the switch doe it job if you are willing to grapple with the bug and don t try to get too fancy in your home setup but the bottom line is that for many people this product is just not ready for prime time if you want a home automation device that you can plug in set up easily and forget about while it function reliably day after day look elsewhere when it s working the wemo offer a lot of way to control anything that can be plugged in to an electrical outlet i wa particularly interested in having light come on around sunset and wanted smart logic that could change that time to follow the season but there are a lot of hidden gotchas daylight saving time sent it into terminal confusion lights would turn off on randomly the device would drop out of my network or become invisible in the wemo app wemo support keep saying reset reboot re install every day come on but to be fair after a fair amount of tinkering and some firmware improvement my switch seem to be working more often than not before you buy go to the wemo community forum and read about all the problem and limitation so that you can determine whether they apply to your setup and whether you would be willing to put up with a bit of tinkering to work around them,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
using alexa to control my light awesome,5.0,bought five of these to control table lamp in a few place through the house frankly i wa sick of having to walk around to all of our light at night to turn them off then stumble around in the dark on my way up the stair i specifically used these with the intention of controlling them via alexa and it worked flawlessly i created one group for the basement two light and one for the living room three light the wemo android app work really easily too to turn them on off only thing i ve noticed is that maybe once a month one of them will randomly disconnect from wifi and i have to reset it just unplug plug back in not a big deal,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
terrible product,1.0,i have a reasonable amount of technical expertise having built computer and done some programming a well a having installed my wireless network and a sonos system the wemo system proved uninstallable the idea is good and the software when not crashing is easy to use however i have been unable to use the wemo switch i initially had some trouble configuring the switch i tried three to make sure i didn t have a defective product and a little difficulty upgrading the firmware after i got the switch updated and configured near my router i moved them to their permanent location that s when the trouble started all switch could no longer be found by the wemo app on my iphone 5 i had to reconfigure them to get them back but unplugging and replugging them in the same outlet near the router also caused them to no longer be recognized trying to configure a switch in my living room and family room at the other end of the house resulted in failure a the wemo could not pick up my wireless network i have an extender for that part of the house and all my device work fine there i m returning the switch a even the one that work close to the router are only good until the first power failure,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
best way to dip your toe into home automation,5.0,i connected three of these switch smart plugs to various light lamp throughout my house using the wemo app wa easy enough but the real power of these switch come from their integration with google home i connected the switch to my google home using ifttt since they haven t released native support just yet and now i can control all of my light without moving from my couch there s the occasional 3 5 second lag between my command ending and the light switching on but it s never long enough where you d question it being worth the money my one con which isn t bad enough to take away a star would be that the switch themselves make an audible click when toggled so from across the room you can hear the plug switch on and off all in all these switch are a great value for anyone entering into the realm of home automation,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great with amazon echo and home automation,5.0,update 5 27 15 i realized the internet connection issue were with the switch distance from the wi fi router these switch need to be fairly close range to the router getting a very good signal so to stay wi fi connected when they are the phone app work very well controlling the switch if installing in area where other wi fi device show 3 bar or le you will have wi fi issue with the switch switch need a really strong wi fi signal to stay connected ps if you install these switch and find the phone app doe not find the switch after installed went ok you need to cycle power off on your router that seems to allow the switch to all successfully connect to your wi fi works really good with the amazon echo and home automation stays online with the echo for reliable switch control i found when only using with the belkin phone wemo app not a good an experience but using the amazon echo with this switch is reliable and slick because both the echo and the switch are always home network wifi connected so both talk to each other and never seem to ever lose communication using with echo great but when using with the phone app iphone android not so good,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
when it finally work it work great,3.0,bought 2 of these thinking great idea they were all very easy to set using the wemo network although it constantly showed a not in range when i wanted to start over it connected fine to my home network but i had some issue getting the application to work it just willy nilly chooses not to find a unit even though it had just 15 minute before during initial set up it took 50 minute to find the 2nd unit i d recommend setting up multiple unit all at once rather than one at a time like i did right now they are both working but now it is asking to do a firmware update i want to but am worried that they won t work after that we ll see i ll modify my review after the update for the timer i set up a light in my living room it come on at night and in the morning just like any other light for the light switch i set one up on the fountain out front when it get really windy the water level drop a the wind blow i could now turn it off remotely using the iphone application the last switch i put in the garage to run a flood light the garage is detached and the switch is in the garage the light wa worthless because i d have to go outside to the garage to turn it on at night not the case now i set up a schedule on my porch light to turn off at sun rise with no event to ever turn it on that allows me to turn it off anytime i want on demand and have it automatically turn off at sunrise it work well when it work for the most part everything worked well the problem i have is the iphone app is clunky if i don t wait for the app to refresh itself i will lose control of my device that seems to be the case when this happens there is no recovery unless i unplug the timer and trip the breaker for the switch no other known way to reset these all three device routinely fall off the network on their own when this happens the schedule appear to still work hard to confirm because they are all over night schedule there is nothing i can do but switch the breaker off and on to get them back they do not recover on their own,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great concept horrible execution save your money,1.0,waste of bought this to control my son tv at night since he stay up all night if we don t sit on top of him 1st 20 minute he 8 y o found the power button on the unit at turned it on manually also the app for my iphone that allows rules to be set up to auto shut off at a certain time what a joke i have had a rule since day 1 and it ha yet to turn off when it is supposed to over 6 month,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i love this wi fi smart plug i have tried many different plug with,5.0,i love this wi fi smart plug i have tried many different plug without very much success this so far is the only one that i have purchased that actually delivered the biggest reason for purchasing these wa to control the amount of time the kid spend playing with their electronic device they are installed in a home automation cabinet even being in this cabinet i can still control it with the app the others are controlling various item in the house another nice feature is that it work with my nest thermostat,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a lot of set up hassle before it work then it s unreliable even once set up,2.0,update 1 year owned dropped the rating from 3 to 2 star these plug are entirely unreliable dropping in and out of the network constantly i ve even assigned permanent ip address to these plug and they are still unreliable they will literally disappear from the app and from the network at completely random the router driver are all up to date and all other item on the network are 100 reliable when you get it set up it work great but it is an unholy pain to setup especially if you change your router setting there is a lot of resetting unplugging and plugging back in downloading and deleting and re downloading the app it s so frustrating that i have one i haven t bothered reseting since changing my router password two month ago,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

the device work just fine pairing with echo wa a piece of cake,3.0,after an unbelievably frustrating installation the device work just fine pairing with echo wa a piece of cake however the rating of 3 is due to the frustrating experience of trying to get it connected to my network this wa easily the most difficult installation that i ve ever encountered and it didn t have to be the installation instruction are vague incomplete and out of date they certainly don t match current android 5 1 setup and the beginning of the setup is actually a preview of the installation process although you might not know that until you ve come irritated by the unresponsiveness of the screen i m not going into the detail of my trial and error process there is quite a bit of self congratulatory help on the belkin web site but much is sadly out of date it s even out of date for the connection to echo i wouldn t recommend against purchasing this device but be prepared to be annoyed this is from an ee with 50 year of experience that said i will buy another provided this unit stay connected for a couple week now to update my experience after just over one month the device is no longer connected to my network it apparently decided to seceed from my system after an hour of fussing it still is not connected and echo cannot find it either i would not recommend this device to anyone connecting and maintaining a network connection seems to be hit and miss connecting a device to a network should not require any effort if you know the network password echo ha certainly proved that do not buy this there must be some alternative device that actually work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good luck connecting the wemo to your home wifi,1.0,the product doesn t work properly for the first day it performed a expected and then began failing i worked with it for two day and it finally came down to the wemo wifi wouldn t connect to my in home wifi because it wouldn t accept the valid password for my in home wifi and therefore wa useless i have many connection to my wifi all using the same password that wemo refused to validate i then went on an extended web research reading evaluation and ala there were others that had exactly the same experience without a solution i returned two wemo s one to home depot and one to amazon the home depot unit had become complete dead inert,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
initially could not get to work with my android phone,3.0,initially could not get to work with my android phone finally installed the wemo app on my android tablet that doesn t have cellular just wifi this time it worked renamed it to something echo alexa could understand and now i can voice control it with alexa the android app really freak out if you try to connect with a phone which ha cellular service i think this is because you have to put the wemo device first in your wifi pecking order which cause you phone to switch to cellular from wifi which totally doesn t work with setup so hopefully you have something that only us wifi once it wa setup on my wifi tablet the wemo app on my phone had it too extremely clunky app hopefully i won t have to use the app very much just alexa,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
convenient home automation,5.0,i bought one of these and loved it so much that i bought another i know some folk have had a hard time setting them up but i didn t have any problem you can control them from alexa or from the wemo app i find use the app to turn on the light before i come home i am going to get another one but there is a mini version of the product that is coming out next week so i am getting that version my guess is that this one will eventually be discontinued,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

no remote use feature,1.0,i like the idea that this work with amazon echo but it need to work remotely based on my experience and feedback on the belkin website it is impossible for many to set this up to work remotely for use when you are not on your home network to me this would be the main use for this item turn on the light from your car upon arrival or remotely when you are traveling after numerous reset and reinstalls of the app last night with little guidance on the company website that went beyond the basic which i had already done this item just doe not work i m pretty tech savvy but this is beyond me i am returning the item something i rarely do,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great reliable wifi switch,5.0,i ve had this switch for about 6 month now and the only problem i have ever had with this thing is when my router used to have problem with intermittent connection loses as soon a i replaced said router it ha been smooth sailing the app that wa installed in my iphone is very easy to use and if you want to use multiple switch you can manually label them any way you like i also have this programmed to run my light on my fish tank and it is accurate to the second another nice thing about using this a a timer is that it will automatically adjust to day light saving time,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

great product when it work,3.0,i have purchased two switch about 4 month ago not very happy with them of all my wi fi device connected to alexa those one are the only giving me a hard time they lose the connection at least once a month both in within 10 foot away from the router sometimes they respond very slow pairing them back is a pain considering both of them act the same i d say it s not a device malfunction but rather a faulty design bottom line if you use them for a critical job ex on an automated home control security function they are not reliable you will enjoy turning on and off a desk lamp though can t say how other brand perform but definitely next time i ll try something else,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

great device,5.0,i really like these i know that some people have issue but i have never had a problem with one i have 5 total in the house these are much easier to set then a timer when i am out of town i also like the randomness of the away mode for light for day to day use these are great for fan light etc i don t have homelink so the fact that they don t work with that is a non factor for me,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i love this thing,5.0,i got this so that my amazon echo could turn on my coffee pot it took a bit of googling but after figuring it out i had to set my phone to airplane mode to set it up and give it a static ip to keep it connected it work perfectly i set a rule in the wemo app to turn it off after 8 minute so my coffee doesn t scorch if i take longer than that to come get it i refill the water and coffee ground after i take the coffee out i named the plug coffee so then all i have to do is say alexa turn on coffee coffee is brewed and it automatically turn off what a time to be alive,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the wemo switch hardware might be good but i never found out because their software,1.0,the wemo switch hardware might be good but i never found out because their software is so horrible you must use their smartphone software to configure the device but their android software wa unable to identify and connect the hardware to the router i m a software and network guy by trade so i know how to work around almost any problem but after several hour of reinstallation attempt tweak and frustration i am returning this item their clever comment on the google play store is please don t ask u if we ve seen any good movie lately because all we ve done for the past two month is code code code they apparently neglected to test test test,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great with amazon echo,5.0,i use my belkin wemo smart plug switch with amazon echo and sometimes the wemo iphone app to turn on off my living room light a i enter and exit my home i also power on off a small space heater with a preset temp i only wish these also worked with apple home kit and siri a well but there is a statement on their website that say this version of the smart plug switch will not be compatible,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
when it worked it s great but it put itself to sleep too often,3.0,setup is ok just follow the instruction a trick on the android moto g4 user turn off the cellular data before setup otherwise there is no way to complete alexa control also worked when it worked it s great it response to alexa but it put itself to sleep too often i have to physically press the power button to wake it up what s the point of having a smart plug that you have go there to power it up in order to use it i have purchased two wemo smart plug and they all have this problem,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
five stars,5.0,works awesome,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
nice idea i had to get three of these,5.0,nice idea i had to get three of these after i purchased my google home it wa slightly tricky getting these set up but after i figured out the first one the other two were a breeze every once in a while google home loses contact with it but after a moment it responds a expected these are shaped to where the should fit directly into a wall socket however i never plug directly into the wall without it being connected to a surge protector first so the shape of the wemo doe encroach on the adjacent socket on each of my surge protector all the same i love turning the light on with a voice command,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i love it it s much more reliable than the ankuoo neo wi fi smart switch,5.0,first i bought an ankuoo neo wi fi smart switch i installed it on my air conditioner a window unit sometimes it worked but often i d come home to find it hadn t turned on the air conditioner when it wa supposed to after a while i finally gave up on it and returned it to amazon thank you amazon it turned out the ankuoo neo app wa buggy and it store the programming on a remote server that is very unreliable the app would crash and often i wasn t able to access the device remotely using the app to make sure it wa on or to turn it on manually this time i did my research i looked for a device that store the programming on the actual device so it will turn on a programmed not only doe my air conditioner always turn on a it should the app always work remotely whether my phone is connected to wifi or not the wemo switch cost more than the other one but the extra cost is worth it the interface on the app is even better than the other one it s better in every way,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great if you re willing to put in the attempt to get it to connect to your wifi setup,4.0,it work great but setup is a pita i must have tried 30 time the first night getting the wemo to connect to my wi fi it would ask for the password and then start over again i have two wemo light switch that work great but they both have issue connecting upon setup or when changing your router ssid i just don t understand why wemo doesn t implement wps and make it simple if the wi fi setup issue were resolved this would be a 5 star product but it took resetting the device my phone my router and two night of attempt to get it to connect and i ve done this twice before,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
nothing wemo work and if it doe it doesn t,1.0,nothing wemo work and if it doe it doesn t work for long i m guessing from reading posting that if you want to be a wemo hobbyist you can get stuff working with on going maintenance but if you just want your light to turn on and off plan to spend an hour or two a month messing with it and replacing away 30 device every now and then,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
perfect for rented dwelling,3.0,i purchased this device for amazon dot using my voice to control the switch and having the app control the switch from outside of my apartment is great this device doe not have to be permanent wired into the electrical system which is perfect for rented dwelling so far the until and app have worked perfectly i had to come back and submit an update for this product over the past six month it responds to command only once only a quarter of the time often time the command to turn on or off ha to be sent twice the unit is closer to the hub than any of the newer unit so there should be no issue if you could bypass this unit and get the updated version that would work better for you i also have the newer unit and they have responded perfectly every time so far,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i would not say this is an easy setup maybe if you are just setting it,2.0,i would not say this is an easy setup maybe if you are just setting it up with wemo app but not if you are setting up with the amazon echo lots of step back and forth i would rate the setup of my first wemo switch a 3 5 but the 2nd wemo switch wa a nightmare difficult sometimes it would be recognized on the wifi network other time not and when a firmware update wa required it wouldn t be recognized at all after that multiple support call it look like this 2nd wemo switch is a failure and will have to be sent in for replacement fortunately it is still under warranty with wemo but not available for return from amazon at this point,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
neat idea but it need work,2.0,we purchased this to use a a controllable timer for a light when travelling originally i wa pleased with the setup and operation a we could set different schedule and turn the light on off remotely even though it is a fairly bulky plug that stick out from the wall outlet we have another wemo device so i wa trying to stay consistent and only use one app for lighting however since then it ha disconnected multiple time the app will not recognize the device and you cannot reconnect to the switch s wifi to set it up again the first time it had to be powered on off several time and eventually it came back to life but that s useless if you re not there to do that that s the point of a remote timer i have sent the troubleshooting email from the app but never received a response from wemo probably won t buy more of their product because of the intermittent service,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love it found a great way to not block the bottom outlet,5.0,i have 5 wemo switch now and they all have worked perfectly at first i wa upset that when in use it covered the bottom outlet due to it s size i bought a 6 prong outlet 2 outlet in front and 2 outlet on each side and it work very well i can hook up the wemo switch at the top and still have the bottom outlet free plus i gain 4 extra outlet so don t let the size of it discourage you from purchasing the 6 prong outlet sell here on amazon for under 6 a an add on item,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
perfect solution,5.0,thesthese wemo switch are by far the most useful and stable automation device in my house we have problem with the wink stuff regularly alexa seems to understand and control these switch better than anything else we di not want a wall o rcountertop switch for our disposal when remodeled so we had the electrician wire a switched outlet into the cabinet under the sink that meant we had to open the cabinet to turn the disposal on and off i put a wemo switch in that outlet and plugged the disposal into the wemo now with our echo sitting on the kitchen island we can imply say alexa turn on disposal and vice versa no more wet hand on the cabinet door,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
disappointing out of box experience no support for complex wifi password,1.0,it s a nonstarter for me since you cannot connect the device to a network with symbol in the password what a waste of time i don t think making my password le secure and having to change every device in my house is worth the benefit of having this device another great example of lazy security for the internet of thing my 10 year old timer will have to keep turning on my espresso machine for me really disappointed if they were lazy about this i can only imagine the rest of the product is a disappointment a well from their support website wemo support wpa2 password of eight 8 to 63 character comprised of letter and number only wemo will fail to connect to your network if your wireless password contains any space or symbol in it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
but i m sure the design will only get better and better,5.0,these switch are big a little clunky but i m sure the design will only get better and better for now however this product doe the intended job you have to download the app on your phone tablet or computer and the name it in the app we use this particular plug for our christmas light we also have alexa to control the switch so we say alexa turn on the christmas light and walla they turn on syncing the switch with alexa wa easy once the wemo app wa installed on my phone after christmas we will use the switch for something else so i will change the name of the switch that way we are not asking alexa to turn on the christmas light and my diffuser turn on,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well when it works,3.0,i bought three of these thing with high hope previously i wa using the manual timer with the little tab i wa already resetting them with the changing sunset and dst i bought this product because of the sunset rule that they have i thought it would be nice to not have to manually update the time throughout the year i purchased one outlet timer from amazon and followed up a few day later with a two pack of light switch from sams they were all very easy to set up on the network i had a few struggle getting the iphone application to work and setting up my own icon for each device i hobbled through it no issue there for the timer i set up a light in my living room it come on at night and in the morning just like any other light for the light switch i set one up on the fountain out front when it get really windy the water level drop a the wind blow i could now turn it off remotely using the iphone application the last switch i put in the garage to run a flood light the garage is detached and the switch is in the garage the light wa worthless because i d have to go outside to the garage to turn it on at night not the case now i set up a schedule on my porch light to turn off at sun rise with no event to ever turn it on that allows me to turn it off anytime i want on demand and have it automatically turn off at sunrise it work well when it work for the most part everything worked well the problem i have is the iphone app is clunky if i don t wait for the app to refresh itself i will lose control of my device that seems to be the case when this happens there is no recovery unless i unplug the timer and trip the breaker for the switch no other known way to reset these all three device routinely fall off the network on their own when this happens the schedule appear to still work hard to confirm because they are all over night schedule there is nothing i can do but switch the breaker off and on to get them back they do not recover on their own my router is le than a year old other application such a the honeywell thermostat all work fine with no issue last night i updated the app on iphone and now today i have no control over my device again on some occasion i would try to turn on a device using the application while in the same area and the app would tell me the device is on and it would not be on sometimes i would push it again and the device would then come on after a second attempt even though the button wa already green on my application i believe conceptually these are nice however i believe we have some bug in the software that really need to be addressed soon at the very least the device should be smart enough to connect back to the router automatically or whatever the problem is with these thing unfortunately i cannot count on these device to function if had to depend on them while out of town i ve also played with the if this then that network and that work well with wemo device for now i will not be investing in any more wemo device until some sort of fix is released i ll hobble along with what i have a they do have some function just not what i paid for i m also concerned about how useful these device would be if belkin decided to abandon their internet framework,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
perfect for echo,4.0,i struggled for a few minute at first trying to get the app to connect to the plug but i just kept trying and on the third try or so it connected and i wa able to get it all set up including setting schedule the alexa app wa able to discover the plug right away and i ve never had an issue controlling the plug ended up buying another because i wa so satisfied with the first through the echo i m going to buy two more of them to control various light around my apartment,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
belkin wemo customer support is woefully lacking especially compared to others when problem arise no phone support,1.0,this is not specific to this wemo switch a much a it is a commentary on the belkin wemo support for the whole environment which is severely lacking their device have worked well right out of the box and with alexa but when something fails down the road my experience is that their support process suck i co own a cell phone and computer repair and home automation business and use my home a a test bed to recommend different solution to customer for wemo in the beginning i ordered the wemo hub with a couple of smart plug later expanded system to 4 wemo bulb 3 smart plug and 4 light switch the wemo hub failed after around 6 or so month it will not establish connection with my device the smart plug and light switch still work with alexa a they are accessed directly via wifi the bulb don t a they use rf and need the hub to translate so the bulb are useless without the hub and the switch can t be put on a schedule without hub which wa a significant reason to order them to activate light when out of town the only way i found belkin to offer support for these wemo device is via email no live phone interaction in my case the issue is clearly a defective hub been doing home automation for many year so this issue is not rocket science and the email interaction offered is a rudimentary level 1 support dialog script that i already tried before i reached out to them my very simple request wa for them to verify the defect and then send me a warranty exchange they were unable to put this into motion so i requested several time a phone call back to talk to someone for 5 minute to resolve after a month since the latest ask i have yet to receive a call and at this point don t expect one so the hub just sits there reminding me of their lack of phone support and inability to do simple warranty exchange so save yourself a lot of frustration when a problem arises and order a different manufacturer switch plug my experience with other vendor like tp link which have live customer support and functionally identical unit are they are competent and have always resolved issue quickly and to my satisfaction one specific similar example wa a warranty issue with a smart tp link motion detector that happened a couple of week after the wemo hub failure tp link resolved it quickly i reached their live phone support and after walking through the diagnostics with their support person on the line they determined it wa a defective unit cross shipped a replacement and i wa back up an running in le than 4 day contrast this with belkin wemo which still unresolved almost 2 month later,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo,2.0,works but tends to disappear from my echo intermittently update 12 16 16 when this device work it s really great the problem is that the switch is only intermittently available on the echo and the wemo app it s really great to turn the garage or exterior light on using your phone when you are coming home however the app is only available about half the time setup wa also very difficult and i wa only able to finally complete setup with information i found on the internet i like the feature of the switch but i think the manufacturer ha a ton of work to do to get this right the plug in wemo switch although difficult to set up keep working all the time i d buy more of these if they worked better,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
now the software wa very crappy wi fi connection get disconnected every once in a,1.0,i own two of the light switch and two of the switch they are some very poorly designed product and software the light switch can not be used a a anything but a single switch if you have a two way or even a three way switch configuration it doesn t work the switch are a bit bulky so you can t really plug in a large plug into the other outlet now the software wa very crappy wi fi connection get disconnected every once in a while so you end up not seeing the control the switch are very bad with the wi fi connection their support for android is very lacking i posted in their forum about the status of android 5 support a few week before the actual release of android 5 there wa no response until about 3 week after android 5 release for them to say that it will be ready soon other wemo developer had their app working for the android 5 release but not belkin it s their own product and they don t have a release that work it s not like android 5 preview were not available to the public since the preview were available for month before the final release totally lacking support for android maybe better on iphone but since i don t use iphone it s useless to me the rule don t work too well and very limited there is no option of just having it run for x amount of time and then shut off did i mention how bad the wi fi connection are the switch are about maximum 3 foot away from my ac dual band router and it still ha wi fi connection problem my advice find some other product for home automation these device are not reliable update 6 9 2015 just installed the app on the asus zenfone 2 and the app crash it s android 5 0 so i don t see where the problem is the level of incompetence from belkin for android support is just staggering stay away from this product if you own an android phone,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great device for use with cell phone or with amazon echo,5.0,bought this to use with my new amazon echo it work great both with the echo and with our iphone and android phone apps it wa easy to set up when traveling it allows u to pre program time when our light will turn on and off but unlike the timer we ve used for year which were limited to just turning thing on and off at the same time every day the wemo switch smart plug allows u to also turn the light on and off with our cell phone from anywhere in the world whenever we want you do need to make sure you give each switch a unique name that is simple and that you will remember if you re going to use it with the echo or the echo won t recognize what you want to do,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great device if not a a little chunky and clumsy,4.0,wanted to try the wemo recipe in echo so took the dive so far it s been neat but a bit underwhelming we have a home full of philips hue and iot tech so this device ha been a little disappointing we have used our wemo outlet a a way to smarten up a christmas tree and have now swapped it to a lamp we want to keep an edison bulb in rather than add an ugly hue bulb i do recommend this product but i wish i had waited to get the smaller new version a this one take up a full set of two outlet not a deal breaker just kinda irritating if you like smart home stuff and have an echo this is great just maybe spend a bit more and go for the smaller version,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a disappointingly good idea,2.0,the two unit i purchased have been a disappointment rarely do they stay connected to the echo for more than a day they will operate via the wemo app most of the time but that is no more convenient than the x10 switch these were to replace the switch attached to device which are difficult to reach so the need is more than that of just a tech toy i say the wemo is available via the app but they are fickle sometimes failing and having to be reset i cannot see how it is the echo a the harmony television remote capacity work fine on the echo a do the other device on the network the manufacturer wa dismissive when reached asked for assistance funny how they embed a simple contact form in the app itself which then result in a non response,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
makes amazon echo way cooler,5.0,this work great with the amazon echo i have it connected to a small heater under my office desk i named the wemo switch heater and heat you can come up with more than one name for the same device so no if i say alexa turn on heater or alexa heat my foot get a nice hot breeze from my heater you could connect this to a wide variety of device but i would not recommend this for light if you want to control light it would make more sense to buy smart light such a the philips hue in my opinion those require a starter set which is costly but allow voice controlled dimming with the amazon echo understandably it could be more cost effective to control all of the light in a room with one wemo switch by connecting a surge protector or something with multiple outlet to one wemo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
these alexa awesome,5.0,did exactly what i wanted it to do i had been using those rf switched outlet to control lamp led lighting my jukebox etc little remote control scattered all over my man cave now i can simply walk into the room and say alexa turn on basement light boom done setup is dead simple and they ve been very reliable thus far i picked them on sale on black friday for about 20 buck each and that s about a much a i would pay for them with competition coming from a ton of different alexa compatible vendor i would imagine that these will quickly drop to 10 15 each,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love it but the price continues to choke me,4.0,love this plug wemo switch smart plug works fabulously and seamlessly being able to control it via my amazon echo is great but being able to control it via the wemo app on my phone is even better a it saved me from what i thought wa a life threatening situation turn out nobody wa actually breaking into my house when i used the app to turn on a security device plugged into the wemo switch but at the time i thought someone wa and that s all that really matter lol laughing now but it wasn t funny at the time regardless i love this little plug switch the only reason i am giving it le than 5 star is because of the price i got it while it wa 10 off and even then i choked on the price,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
before you buy the wemo,1.0,i bought a used wemo switch to try out with my new echo day one set up wa quick and easy and wemo worked day two there wa a problem with my xfinity router and i had to refresh it afterwards echo stopped recognizing my wemo wemo stopped working and would not reinstall day three reset wemo to it factory default setting and performed the set up again wemo is working again and my echo is now recognizing it again pros remote access when my router is working correctly easy set up works with echo and iphone 6 cons temperamental a router refresh or power outage mean you will have to reset the wemo and do a reinstall cost there is no way i would pay 49 for this device the wemo app is buggy android and ios version both size of the outlet updated 06 10 2015 my wemo switch ha lost connection with my wireless home network several time since my review since none of my other wireless device are having problem the problem ha to be the wemo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
second best gift idea i have had for my mom,5.0,mom doe not get around easily and this wa perfect to go along with the echo i got her i plugged her living room lamp into and now she just tell echo to turn her light on or off and it communicates with wemo switch sometimes mom visit family longer than intended and ha not left a light on for the cat and parrot she call me and with the wemo app on my phone i can turn her light on for her this and the echo are probably the most useful gift i have thought of for my 74 year old mother,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works with iphone and echo,5.0,super easy to set up down load the phone app first if you plan on using the laptop app 5 00 it will not work until you set it all up with the free phone app i use this with my phone and with the amazon echo works a advertised with both takes only minute to set up and worked the first time out phone app control these switch from anywhere in the world if you continually wonder if you shut something off after you left for work hook one of these up to it and you will never have to wonder again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
don t bother,2.0,this device might be acceptable if you live in a very small home with strong wi fi coverage from a single router in my situation the outlet that i wanted to use this in wa behind a buffet however it wa only about 10 foot from a wireless access point using a wifi analyzer i could see i had a strong signal no matter what i couldn t get it to connect to wifi if i went into my office where my main router is i could get it working searching through post at the wemo community forum there seems to be a lot of issue with wifi connectivity other device seem to have no issue with connecting through the access point so i m confident it isn t a network issue,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great product,4.0,i have three of these an three wemo wall switch in use for the past 18 month work great i say alexa turn on the fan and the fan come on i also use them with a smartthings hub shedule lamp to go off at 8 00am in case i forget to turn them of before going to work i laso have motion sensor setup light come on when i enter a dark room never had a problem with them just follow the direction when setting them up i think the people that give one star just don t know how to use them only giving 4 star because they don t have a dimmer option other than that they are great,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
they work great,4.0,i use two of these switch with my amazon echo i intend to use them when i go out of town to set on and off time so far they have worked very well my only complaint is that they have only one outlet on them which restricts what you can plug into them other than that they work fine set up wa easy but make sure you know which switch is which i geve them name but to them backwards in the set up it wa no big deal to correct them afterwards though and it is interesting to walk into a dark room and tell alexa to turn on a light very cool all in all i am satisfied with them,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i got a smart plug for christmas with my echo,1.0,i got a smart plug for christmas with my echo it installed quickly and cleanly i ordered a second and it ha been dismal i tried installing but i could never get everything synched i went through the instruction on the website three time to no avail i tried twice to contact wemo tech support for help and have yet to get a response i have a smart switch too but i am hesitant to even try it because of the poor record i will probably be returning both soon and moving to a different manufacturer,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
returned after one day due to high pitched constant sound,2.0,i own the device for about 1 day before returning it there wa a high pitched sound coming from the switch at all time it wa a bit like those high pitched notification sound a teenager might use on their phone probably a transformer or rectifier i tried it in another outlet and got the same sound if you look at other review you will find others had this same issue the little i used the device otherwise it seemed to work fine there is a clicking sound when it turn something off and on but that wa a non issue for me the device didn t block the second wall plug,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
buggy device not worth the hassle,2.0,this switch isn t worth the hassle it failed on u for the last time this past week i ve given up on it and no longer use it it failed on u at least 6 time in the past 3 month getting it to work each time it fails requires a 30 minute process which involves a 10 minute hard reset getting a phone to connect to it s wifi network setting it up again in the wemo app and then disconnecting from it wifi network we also use this switch with our smartthings and our echo which require additional setup after each reset i ve upgraded the firmware and read a couple support article but don t have time to mess with it anymore i ll be sticking to the other more reliable switch brand in the future,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
so cool,5.0,love it we have it connected to our amazon echo use it to turn on off our christmas tree saves time and hassle of having to unplug our tree at night in case we forget to turn off we use the echo remote to turn it off technology is amazing there is an app a well to use with your smart phone i use it with my iphone no issue and easy to navigate many other function that are helpful and fun must have if you have the echo get the most from it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not ready for market,2.0,i wanted to like this it work with the nest product and i recently got rid of my alarm system and remote technology and needed something to replace it with this just doesn t stay connected to my wifi and there is no reason for it when i needed it recently while away on a trip it wouldn t work said it wa offline the whole time i had to come home and reset it i have to reset it a lot it s pretty much useless if you have to be home to use it right,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
annoying to set up but very nice once it is working,4.0,i have set up three of these switch now every time without fail set up failed the first time even when i had plugged in the switch only a few foot away from my router every time i have found it necessary to do a hard reset of the switch every time doing that hard reset fixed the problem and the next attempt to set up the switch succeeded other than that these switch have been wonderfully convenient now that there are echo dot scattered around my home i can turn on my bedroom fan without turning on the light or getting out of bed shut off all the power to all the av component in my home theater setup and turn on some light in the basement when i enter via the side door so four star instead of five due to the annoying setup problem but well worth it if you can get past that problem hint if your switch can t seem to join your home network even though you are sure you gave it the right password you have run into the same problem a i have the reset switch is labeled reset and is located along the top edge of the switch unplug the switch press the reset button don t let go plug in the switch while still pressing down on the reset button and wait until the little light turn amber then try setting up the switch again it should work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
hidden ssid not supported,2.0,i cant believe that this device will not support network where the ssid is hidden in order to get this device to connect i had to make my router visible to the world then device will continue to work a long a it is connected to power and the ssid is hidden however if you unplug it or loose power you have to make your router visible to the world it s too bad they couldn t retain the ssid so that when you unplug it to move it or you lose power you don t have to go through a bunch of gyration to get the device back on line i had planned to buy more of these but one is all i will buy until they fix this problem a lot of other device work very nicely with hidden ssid s so it cant be that hard to do please fix it it is too bad because the device is very usable otherwise,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great prefer newer model with power consumption monitoring,4.0,this is a great device that wa easy to setup you can check out a plethora of technical info that i have posted here http goo gl nndfpq the iphone app is very easy to use and will support multiple wemo device you can even snap a photo of each lamp etc and that way you know which device your turning on and off within the app my only complaint is that belkin released a newer wemo after i purchased this one that also monitor energy consumption that s the only reason that i didn t rank this one perfectly i d definitely buy this same wemo again but would prefer having power monitoring too this make it easy to turn on light etc while at home or away via the internet i have not encountered any problem with the device and belkin release firmware update periodically which basically install themselves don t feel like you have to be a technical nerd to purchase and or use this device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not bad for a 1 0 product,3.0,note this review is for the wemo switch not the insight switch or the light switch or the motion control i wish amazon didn t lump all the wemo product review into the same list for a first generation product it s not bad it s easy to setup and use with that said the android app is awful i couldn t not set up a timer with the app alone which is deplorable for a product that so heavily depends on a remote control aka the app if you can t use the app or don t want to have to depend on the app remote then don t get this product what turned this product around for me wa the ifttt if this then that website integration you can do quite a lot to the wemo through ifttt including setting up timer the timer can be a simple or complex a you want for example you can have the wemo turn on a light at sunset or x number of minute before after sunset sunrise the on off button on the wemo is nice to turn on a light or other device if i had to only depend on the app to control the wemo i would have returned it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great idea buggy execution,3.0,it exhibit a weird behavior where it keep switching on and off like a dozen time a minute before either finally settling into on which is what i wanted or off which is not i have no idea what would be causing it and they don t have any faq regarding it so i m assuming that this is not a bug they know about or it s not one they know how to fix really really wanted to like this and it is cool to be able to turn thing on and off with a cellie but depending on what you plug in that kind of behavior could be a pretty bad thing to subject your device to,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
aziz light thank you aziz,4.0,there s an awkward layout between my bed and the nearest light switch between that the fact that i own and love an amazon echo and that this wa a lightning deal i figured i d give it a shot took a long time for my echo to get the hang of it but eventually it started recognizing my command to operate the light i m not sure why there wa a delay but it s been working pretty consistently ever since sometimes alexa say okay and the light doesn t respond but it s rare btw i call my light aziz if anyone get the reference,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
delightful product fyi one cannot connect to wemo remote access using a vpn,4.0,wemo product live up to their reputation for ease of use and security the initial setup wa easy the programming straightforward after a few month i switched router and ran into a problem accessing my wemo product from my phone but not the other phone and tablet in the house it wasn t the router change it wa because i had my vpn active on my phone it took a while to puzzle that out it s not something i found in the help faqs or initial search of the community one cannot connect to wemo remote access using a vpn,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
we now own 4 of these and have them all,5.0,we now own 4 of these and have them all linked to our amazon alexa installation take le than 10 minute only once did i have to restart from the beginning for whatever reason we have now used wemo for over two month and once installed have had zero issue my daughter love telling alexa to turn on the christmas tree light i look forward to buying more in the future,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a while and for the most part they work fine however,4.0,i ve had my wemo switch for a while and for the most part they work fine however setup can be a bit confusing each wemo is basically it s own wifi hotspot once you do get it setup be prepared for the switch to download a new firmware version which is kind of pain since you have to do it for each one i have 6 setting up integration with your amazon alexa is also slightly complicated if you want to group your light together if you re tech savvy you shouldn t have any problem but if you re not it s best to get a geek friend to set them up for you,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
alexa do cool stuff for me,4.0,love these thing such an easy solution for making a smart home on the cheap works perfectly with alexa but if the power go out or the internet go down they have to be reset which is a bit of a pain also there are constant update for these thing seems like every time i open the app but still the ease of set up the dependability the convenience and showing off in front of the guest make it so much fun to have got them on sale for about 30 each and bought 2 for my parent a well,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good for controlling a limited number of appliance,4.0,wemo is great for if you want to control a few item set up wa easy but you need to update firmware at first option i set these up to control some appliance i can effectively disconnect power to the toaster and coffee maker when i leave i use the wemo motion sensor to turn them back on when i am in the kitchen the cons i used my belkin energy use monitor and found out that each switch cost about 2 50 per year to operate that can be much more than the parasite energy consumption of any new appliance you are controlling they also have a slight delay that can be annoying in certain situation if you want to do more or build a smart home go right to smartthings or another z wave controller,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
surprisingly quick but unfortunately clunky,4.0,i love almost everything about the wemo switch it s surprisingly quick i expected it to be kind of slow but it s not at all the audible click of the relay is surprisingly satisfying and the power button on the switch wa a nice addition however the device itself is so unfortunately large and clunky and make it near impossible to fit anything else on the same outlet let alone 2 wemo switch it is also somewhat of an eye sore so if you re looking for something discrete this is not for you i d like to think that the new wemo mini is just a fast and a well designed a this one but smaller and le obtrusive but i have not got around to buying that one yet definitely go with that one if you can spare the cash other than that though great product 4 5 star i would and have recommended to friend and family,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
fantastic product i purchased two of these to pair,5.0,fantastic product i purchased two of these to pair up with my amazon echo after downloading the app it took le than 3 minute to set up i beefed up my wifi signal and router a few month ago to 5g so i wa certain that the connection would be good the app work great and the amazon echo alexa pairing wa simple and easy based on other review i decided not to update the wemo firmware the switch are working great so why bother fixing something that is not broken until i am certain that the firmware update work and won t cause the switch to malfunction i will keep the using the current firmware version that wa already loaded other reviewer that have complaint may consider updating their router or contact their internet service providers isps and increasing their outage if you updated the firmware and the product is now not working perhaps return the switch get replacement and keep the firmware a is i absolutely love these and plan on purchasing several more to automate my home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great setup wasn t a easy a i had hoped,5.0,works great setup wasn t a easy a i had hoped but i managed to figure it out without much difficulty i just downloaded a firmware update so maybe it will be easier in the future i use it with my amazon echo to control a lamp in my bedroom i do plan to buy more of these in the future,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
literally disconnect for no reason,1.0,just bought 2 of these on black friday and both of them don t work consistently at all they re all updated and i have 5 others in my house but these two will stay connected for about 5 10 minute and start blinking orange until unplugged and plugged back in they re only 20 foot away from my 400 wifi router so it s not a wifi issue these are garbage go buy the tp link switch version i have 9 and they all work and have never had issue in my 7 month of ownership,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
so far so good,3.0,the most recent app update added the much needed away mode that will allow you to create a schedule wherein light come on at random interval stay on for at least 30 minute and go off again this is important because a smart burglar will look for lamp on a timer set up wa easy on 5 of the 6 unit the sixth one required a factory reset before it showed up the app still need some work i find myself force closing the app a little too often because it is out of sync with the actual state of the outlet sometimes it fails to load a well on the first attempt it need some obvious thing like zone for easier timer creation and the ability to separate them on the device screen by category lamp fan appliance and custom group created by the user auto refresh would be nice too i have tried and failed with plenty of product in my desire to have some home automation and unless something drastic change i believe i have found my answer update 05 06 14 app version 1 5 1 fw 2 00 4494 i am experiencing some issue now the away mode doe not seem stay within it time constraint it give the home an unnatural look if light are coming on after certain time even with all the away mode timer disabled i have lamp coming on at odd time and some lamp not coming on when scheduled,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great smart plug probably my top choice,5.0,i absolutely love these little thing i have smart plug by wemo tp link and iris and i think the wemos are my favorite set up is easy with the wemo app and it connects to my echo with ease i also like that the plug don t cover up the bottom plug on a typical wall outlet you do need to use the upper plug if you want to use both the wemo is pretty shallow too and fit behind pretty much any bookshelf or bed like the plug on a power strip would the construction seems sturdy like it should not like a cheap piece of plastic i haven t had any connectivity problem at all since i started using it and i don t anticipate any all in all i m a fan,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
should be great when it work but in my case it can t connect to wifi once unplugged returning,2.0,i guess it s a great product when it work however if something go wrong expect to spend quite a bit of time to search for guidance on troubleshooting starting with url for product or support found it in fine print on the box yes i m aware of google search no i still like to have url on the box for the product i paid for now i understand why overall rating on amazon and on other site is not that great i configured it when it wa plugged in an easily accessible outlet everything work great i can turn it on an off using wemo app i have alexa integration enabled and can see how i m turning it on and off with my voice great right wrong when i plugged it to the outlet few foot from the easily accessible one it didn t connect to wifi ok let me try another outlet that is even closer to my wifi router that is also few foot from all of these outlet no it won t connect to wifi i don t like this fragility at all everything is setup and device ha a simple task connect to specific wifi once you re plugged in wifi signal is strong device fails to connect i m sorry i m not going to spend more of my time fighting whatever is the reason i m returning it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
does not work with amazon echo alexa i,1.0,does not work with amazon echo alexa i wa able to configure it with the wemo app but alexa wa never able to detect it going through support to try all of the obvious failed after resetting the device it became flaky and would work some of the time and not at all other time i ended up returning and replacing it with a different brand of similar device and it work flawlessly with alexa going by my own experience and all of the review this device is not ready for prime time,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
which is a very good direction,5.0,i put it in my daughter s room and paired with amazon echo reason being my 5y daughter said it s too dark in her room and she dare not go there by herself when it s the time at night now she shout out alexa turn on the light please while on the stair to the 2nd floor she now like to go upstairs earlier than before which is a very good direction,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
kept turning it self off and on creeped me out real bad,2.0,worked great until i moved and then it randomly started switching itself off and on it started out slowly at first and just got worse and i kept thinking i wa being haunted which wa ridiculous so i just unplugged it and threw it in a drawer since then i have not noticed any other supernatural occurrence so this product must just suck also wa such a pain to try to set up via the app it would always fail to connect the first time and maybe a couple more time after that was long delay for alexa to turn light off sometimes very annoying i think smart plug technology need refinement at this time,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i would hate to have to touch every one of these every,4.0,i bought this device to control some electronics with amazon s echo after going through the short setup process through the phone i tried it out with echo and it the echo said my connected home wa not set up and to contact customer support shortly after a message came up in the wemo app saying i needed to do a firmware update on the switch this happened two more time each about 5 minute apart once the wemo app said that the switch wa on the latest firmware i tried again to have the echo find the device and finally had success it worked flawlessly until this morning when i asked the echo to turn on the lamp the echo responded ok which mean it sent the command but the lamp didn t turn on i tried a couple more time with the same result finally i walked over to the switch and pressed the blue on button this seemed to wake up the device and echo wa once again able to control it i m not sure if this is supposed to work this way or not i would hate to have to touch every one of these every morning just to be able to control it with the echo with it being plugged in i would assume it would always stay connected to the wifi we ll give it more time and see what happens but that is why only the four star other than this it ha worked flawlessly,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great purchase,5.0,i love my wemo switch i use it to light up my chrismas tree it wa so easy to hook up it took me just second i use it s integration with alexa so all i have to do is say alexa turn off on christmas tree and wala it s must buy for a smart home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
sigh,3.0,while i love this when it work it can be so infuriating when it go wrong the setup is kind of easy sometimes it doesn t find the wemo sometimes when i do the hard reset and set it up all the way to the end the wemo will not the found a a device and i have to start over again sometimes it doesn t find the wifi and so i cannot control it anymore sometimes there is a delay from pressing the wemo to the object plugged in turning on this is a problem because i think it didn t turn on and so i press the button again and then it turn it off but then again once it work it s great to have it s another item that i can setup with my smartthings hub i really wish the setup wa easier than they advertise here s my story of trying to get it to work it took me 15 20 minute to do a hard reset because i thought i could just hold down the restore button while plugged in but it did not work the way wemo advertises it should take a lot quicker than that i thought it did work at first because my phone found the wemo on wifi but then could not connect so i have to do the unplug the wemo hold down restore button plug it back in while still holding down the restore button and the release when the light is blinking amber quickly even after that it didn t work completely and i got too frustrated so i gave up and i ll try again later,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great,5.0,my husband alexa and i all approve one of the best alexa compatible switch i have seen and we have a fully functioning smart home we connected this to our fan in bedroom so we don t have to get out of bed when we forget to turn it on which you all know is awful when you are all cozy and you have to rock paper sizzors for who ha to get cold again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
completely useless,1.0,i have wasted so much time on this product that i feel like belkin should pay me for my time unfortunately i purchased 4 switch and a motion detector at the same time 2 year ago since then i have spent so much time rebooting resetting and reinstalling these that it boggles my mind every time there is a firmware update the switch need to be reset that process can take a long a an hour multiply that by the number of firmware update and the number of device i have and you have enough time to develop your own product please take my advice and do not buy these they are useless,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
don t waste your money,1.0,although set up wa quirky i wa initially happy with it until i had to upgrade my home router i have never been able to get it re connected it won t even give me it own wi fi to start the connect sequence i ve tried on multiple occasion thinking somehow it might magically work and i ve been through every trouble shooting technique on the web to no avail it s a complete waste of money if it won t even connect to it own wi fi server much le your home router,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
recommended work perfectly but hog outlet space and make buzzing noise,4.0,works really well and is so convenient i use this to control a desk lamp from my bed pros work perfectly a designed simple to set up schedule are great and very versatile cons it make a high pitched buzzing sound that power adapter and light sometimes make most people might not notice this but i am sensitive to these noise so if you are too be warned it take up a good chunk of outlet space if you are using the other socket for a larger plug this might not coexist there is only 1 plug obviously based on the picture but you realize this more when you lose outlet space,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good product when using 3rd party software,2.0,had to go through setup 3 time before it stuck once connected to wifi it really struggled with keeping a solid connection although it s only 10 foot from my ultra powerful router no other wireless device have issue with connectivity and there are sometimes a many a 20 between the 2 bridged router in my home as soon a you set it up ditch the native app if you have an android and download automation manager for wemo takes a little tinkering to setup but once you do the possibility are endless regarding rule and tasker integration,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

latest firmware upgrades seem to have really stabilized this product,5.0,i have 3 wemo s in total now when i first bought them i had issue with random disconnect from the network but since the last firmware upgrade that belkin have done they seem to be a stable a a rock if you have multiple bridge access wireless zone a i have i did have issue on occasion with being able to access see the wemo from one of more of the remote access point again since the last firmware upgraded that issue also seems to have been fixed i actually love this product i use it in so many novel way example applied to the input to the psu on my gate electromagnetic lock system i can let someone in to the garden from my i phone without giving out the access code to the front panel from anywhere in the world i use the feature on a regular basis example fedex delivery can call me at the gate i let them in by powering psu off from wemo i reset the wemo on and the gate re lock they leave the package at the front door and leave using the internal access exit switch to exit security and convenience all in one,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the best of the best,1.0,update i have now had 2 of my 3 switch fail and not be able to connect to my wifi belkin wemo support is horrible i spent an hour trouble shooting this before i contacted them only to be on chat for over 30 minute before i had to redo everything i already did i am automating my home light and i tried this the ihome and the tplink i returned the others and kept this i don t have a smarthings hub yet but i use alexa to control this and love it so much i use this to control my undercabinet led light just on off no color but i love that when i m cooking and forget to turn on my light i can just tell alexa and she doe it i leave them set to white for cooking i also like i and turn it on manually very easily,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
will not purchase this product again,1.0,i tend to wait several week prior to writing a review to make sure that i have ample time to accurately evaluate product performance i found the setup a little difficult documentation is poor relative to other technical product that i have setup i have my wemo switch linked with my amazon dot the one main reason why i only gave this product one star is due to the switch constantly losing connection with my network the switch is located within 20 foot from my router almost line of site i have many other wireless device in my home that are located three time this distance and have never experienced any problem or dropout this ha occurred at least once a week for the several week that the switch ha been installed i had to constantly unplug an plug the switch in order to connect to my network if you read the review carefully you will see that this is a known problem my network is operating perfectly and have not experienced any of my other device dropping off the network except the switch this is a very frustrating problem the next switch that i order will be a tp link switched i have 2 friend that are using tp link switch and have not experienced any problem at all bottom line read the review carefully before purchasing,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
garbage stay far away will die after a few month,1.0,garbage worked great for about 2 3 month then started having problem periodically but if i refreshed the wemo it would work fine now it will not connect to my wifi no matter what i do i have refreshed and reset my entire wifi system numerous time and it just will not connect i have tried to contact belkin 3 time because it s still under warranty and i can never get anyone on the phone i ve waited over 25 minute each time and still wa not able to speak to someone so i hang up because i have a newborn and cannot spend a ridiculous amount of time waiting to speak to someone,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

this is my second one and it work just fine does suck up the entire outlet box though,5.0,this is my second one and it work just fine does suck up the entire outlet box though if you re lucky you can use it in the top plug and maybe plug something else in the bottom plug i don t like that the price seems to fluctuate on amazon wa going to buy another one but stopped because the price wa higher than i paid just day before good switch though work well and never fails would be nice if it had a dimming feature for use with lamp or a product made available specifically for lamp with dimming capability,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

trash unreliable get the tp smart plug for same price,1.0,so trash get the tp link smart plug instead if you aren t looking for smart hub and just use a bunch of smart plug the plug is always disconnecting from the wifi when i open the app so i basically can t control the switch half the time i also am not able to use the remote feature option because the app just doe not work not reliable at all and terrible product the tp link smart plug is way better and will be purchasing and recommending those instead they are also the same prcie,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
amazing what technology and do,5.0,i got this device when is wa on sale at amazon i already have the amazon and echo and wanted an easy way to turn the light on and off on the christmas tree the device is fairly easy to set up you must make sure that your network frequency and the wemo frequency match i run on the 5 frequency and there wa not a problem for some reason after the amazon echo discovered the wemo it took a short while for the name of the wemo to be recognized but after a short period i can now say alexia turn on the christmas tree light and with in a second the light come on you can hear the relay inside the wemo click on and off if there are any problem with the wemo i will update this review,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
absolutely the worst piece of tech i ve ever owned,1.0,absolutely the worst piece of tech i ve ever owned really it s not an exaggeration the worst hand down connecting to this device is an extremely mind numbing experience that entail nothing but every single swear word you can scream at an inanimate object i have owned wireless printer multiple router the amazon echo several laptop switch server among other device and i haven t come barely close to the level difficulty to connecting and maintaining this piece of how on earth did belkin release this or signed off on this it s staggering how awful this thing is,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i have a surge protector not sure if they recommend against that plugged into one of them,4.0,i bought two of these setup wa straight forward i plugged it into the wall switched my wifi to the wemo went through the step and within a few minute the switch wa working i have a surge protector not sure if they recommend against that plugged into one of them to that i have a humidifier and a heater plugged in it s been nearly 2 week and i absolutely love it i can be in out and about and a the evening approach i can turn on my wemo switch which will make my bedroom nice and cozy by the time i get home my second switch is for a light in my living room it s in an awkward corner and difficult to get to with the wemo it s never been simpler to turn on the light i have yet to use the timer feature however wemos integration with ifttt make it even better i have my living room light go on when the sun set it work so well that i ve purchased a wemo light switch the only complaint i have about the wemo is the android widget it s very convenient when it work it s actually awesome when it work however there are time when the button are non reactive you click them and nothing happens you actually have to open the app up and let everything refresh before thing work again overall i would buy more and probably more of the wemo family product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works occasionally at best will sometimes decide to flash blue and refuse,1.0,works occasionally at best will sometimes decide to flash blue and refuse to turn on even when pressing the power button unplugging and plugging back in seems to work every so often to reset the device connecting to the network is decently easy that is when the mobile app doesn t out right crash the app is worse than the plug crashing every time i try to turn the device on or off at least is pair with the echo but even that ha a heck of a time trying to connect to this thing avoid and go with something better,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great product very convenient,4.0,very useful gadget how it work is simply through one of the following option option 1 through mobile app wemo to switch on off lighting or other device either on the wlan or remotely from outside option 2 set certain light at home to switch on off by sunset sunrise according to location set by you in my case for example manama city in kingdom of bahrain the sunrise sunset are automatically set via internet best part is in the morning when we wake up to work and you need that extra 5 minute to get ready to work instead of going around the house switching off the night lamp option 3 still not tested through amazon echo alexa vocal command to perform switch on switch off pros very convenient especially that my wife is pregnant and sometimes it is a hassle for her when i m not around to turn light on off around the house at night we sometimes have to wake up at night and go to daughter s room when she wake up this is a good feature to turn on daughter s room lighting before we reach to her just to comfort her when she wake up in the middle of the night another good option is to control house lighting while away from home cons some switch work on wlan and are not detected remotely while others are totally the opposite and they keep on refreshing and sometimes they appear and other time they are not detected therefore i have set some of them to automatic on off option one of the switch ha a small buzzing sound something like the old internet dial up sound but a little more discrete not sure whether it is faulty although it is functioning well overall the product is really nice and i would greatly appreciate if belkin can create a device that can control air conditioning working with ir remote control and also to have more option and size for light switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

unreliable what is automation if you have to physically be there to reset the device when it disconnect,2.0,wow be prepared for the most unreliable product to ever hit the market my dell tablet is more reliable than this thing i give 2 star because when it work it just work well aside from the app being super slow to load and search for device albeit it still work but for random reason unexplained the outlet will become not connected to the network and the only way you can get it back on the network is to pull it out and plug it back in not even pressing the physical button on the outlet will reconnect it it seriously need a pull out and in maneuver so at a time you want to activate it and you are not near the outlet you are out of luck until you go back to the outlet and physically reset it this is horrendous for a product that sell itself for automation just hope that if you have something you absolutely need turned on remotely that it will be connected when you need to myself i use it a remote garage door opener to let guest in when i am not around the fact that i can t rely on this defeat the purpose of why i bought it but hell it work sometimes i just have to cross my finger and even when it work i would do a hard reset the morning of if i am sure i will need to activate it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
would be cool if it would work,1.0,i am pretty tech savvy but cannot get this thing to work every now and then it will actually connect to my network but when i proceed to do the firmware update it loses connection and can never be found again this could be an awesome device if only it could work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
my espresso machine is preheated when i wake up bliss,4.0,i need my coffee first thing i have this switch turn on my espresso machine before i wake up so that it is preheated and ready to go when i am this device wa easy to set up using my iphone i used the app to connect to the switch wirelessly and connected it to my 5th gen airport extreme router had to reset it after daylight saving time hit last fall recently had to reset the switch again when it started having trouble connecting to my router and then finally failed turned out to be the router going bad not the switch s fault at all i could accomplish most of this with a cheap light timer but if i wake up early or late i can hit the switch from upstairs using my ipad then by the time i make it to the kitchen the espresso machine is preheated the only thing that would be better is if my husband were to get up and make the latte for me and then deliver it to me in bed,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love it,5.0,work great with the amazon alexa gives me some peace of mind when my wife arrives home she can turn the light on in the house from the wemo app a well if you have the amazon alexa in your bedroom and you forgot to turn the light off in the living room no problem alexa will do it for you i have also ordered the amazon dot to keep in the living room,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it ha a cute surprised face but horrendously unreliable,2.0,i bought this just like everyone else to pretend that we re at home while hundred of mile away on vacation we used with a light by the window and tried with the app on my iphone the set up wa very easy even for a technologically challenged gal like me we were so excited and well the timer worked half the time and sometimes the light turned on few minute later but most of the time it didn t turn on at all and turning on via app wa the same sometimes it turned on and other time it didn t we decided that it wa not reliable enough and ditched it a switch that worked via wi fi is such a nice concept and it s so miserably unreliable now it s sitting on my desk greeting me with the cute surprised look on the front,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
unreliable,2.0,i m frustrated with these plug they are hit or miss i ve connected them to alexa and they work consistently on a schedule but whenever i ask alexa to turn them off or on she usually reply that they re not responding and if i try to use the wemo app to turn them on or off it often indicates the plug is not detected so i have to get up and push the button on the plug to turn them on or off totally negating their purpose not to mention that they are so large there are not many other item with a plug small enough to make use of the other outlet also they seem to require an update every few month and every time the update lock up get stuck for over 24 hour and i ultimately have to manually reset them altogether and reconnect them to alexa i m over it i just purchased replacement from another major brand i already have 2 from that brand in another room and those work without fail i m giving two star because i knew about their likelihood of blocking the second outlet when i bought them and they do work properly when a schedule rule is programmed,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
decent device,5.0,this is my second such switch and i m quite pleased with their performance and the phone app that control them both are used to control my through wall air conditioner it s so night to turn them on 30 minute before i head home so the house is already cooled down when i walk in the door if it s only mildly hot outside then i have the option of turning on just one the company is routienly updating the app always seeming to make improvement where they can i never had any problem with the app but they still seem to find way to make it better,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
typical belkin junk,1.0,ordered and wa not sure if wa a good idea a i have had no luck with belkin product in the past well i should have listened to my inner voice i got two of them it wa a constant battle to keep them connected and working alexa and echo are both great but never again for any belkin product both are defective and cannot seem to find and maintain a connection to by wifi network which is a linksys modem and wireless router with linksys extender all of which work great am going to toss the wemo device a my window to return ha run out do not i repeat do not waste money on this product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
but once they were it worked like a dream,5.0,it took me a while to get alexa and the plug on the same page but once they were it worked like a dream full disclosure i installed this in my grandparent living room so that they could get some lighting without having to navigate through darkness or fumble for a switch of course when i learned that with the wemo app i can turn the light on and off from anywhere thing got a bit out of hand thankfully the grandparent were entertained with the mysterious light that would go on and off during their evening newspaper reading and tennis watching so it all turned out okay and they are much more comfortable telling alexa what to do now,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo switch smart plug,1.0,i have my security camera system plugged into this because sometimes a camera go offline and i need to power the system off and back on remotely i wa very happy with it until i had a power outage this week when the power came back on this thing stayed off instead of returning to the previous state i didn t realize until a day later that my camera were off this is unacceptable and i will be looking for a different brand if this one problem were fixed this would be a great product i did a search for this problem and found people complain about this 5 year ago so i don t have any hope that wemo will fix it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

awesome for the novelty factor wouldn t trust it for vital activity,4.0,full disclosure i m a tech nerd so i think anything smart and controllable with my phone is pretty awesome that being said i really like this wemo what i don t like is the android app that control it up until recently the app wa utterly unusable a in it simply did not work it would consistently crash and when it didn t function like rule just wouldn t work with the latest update however the app seems to be pretty stable and i ve been able to control my standing floor lamp well if you are like me and obsessed with controlling everyday item with your phone get it if you re looking to rely on this thing for vital function in your everyday life go the dumb route and use your hand,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works fine except for a problem with wifi password,4.0,my wemo switch work fine now that it s set up but setting it up wa a frustrating experience because it can t deal with wifi password that contain space character i had to reconfigure my wifi network to use a different password and reprogram all my other device to use the new password the wemo people really should explain this limitation up front rather than requiring the user to figure it out by trial and error or even better they should change the firmware to remove the limitation,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
handy and fun,5.0,i can not tell you how much i love these smart plug i have them paired with the amazon echo to control the light in my living room it is fun to tell alexa to turn the light off and on these work very well i have had them for quite a while and never had a problem i also like the fact that i can control the switch with my iphone app from anywhere handy when you forget to leave light on pretty funny to watch the look on my guest face when i voice command my light off and on i will be purchasing more of these for the rest of my house,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

great idea really really bad execution,1.0,when i first set it up it wa so easy and cute i ordered a second one i wa too hasty they both suffer from the same issue so i am assuming it is a design flaw and not a one off glitch at any undetermined time of their choosing the wemo s decide to stop receiving wifi signal thinking perhaps my wi fi signal wa too weak i placed them 10 foot from my router after 48 hour they were both unresponsive it wa a great idea and certainly not technically challenging but poorly executed my guess is that the wifi receiver in the wemo is just not sensitive enough i am going to try belkin customer support if that doesn t solve the problem amazon expect them both back,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it work but with so many problem,3.0,pros 1 it work especially the switch on the app i don t see any lag about this it can be turned on off immediately when i touch the switch on the app 2 easy to setup just follow the guide it s not hard to set up it even though it s no so fast cons 1 the app on android suck it s the worst app i have used i can hardly input the device name and change the time because the weird app design it doesn t follow any android style design 2 still the app on android i cannot edit the rule after i set it up it keep showing looking for rule it s a serious bug therefore i have to use ifttt which is a good replacement of the timing rule but it need the internet working since the rule is in the cloud and compared with the local rule you have to accept 3 10 minute lag with ifttt 3 fortunately there s a third party app a a replacement of official app even though it get 4 5 star on the play market it doesn t mean that it way more better to use lag is still the main problem even with the direct switch update after one month i realise that it can be unstable since sometime on ifttt com it s showing wemo switch is offline so that it doesn t work through ifttt i have to reconnect the decive to my router,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great smart home product,5.0,i have a bunch of these and they work great easy to set up and control with echo during the christmas season i hook them up to the window candle light also use to control living room and bed room lamp a well a one for my quartz heater i can turn it on and off from bed the remote for the heater is very limited a in you have to be with in a couple of foot for the oem remote to work i also have a wemo wall switch for the ceiling fan light what would be nice is if wemo would develop a pc app i can use on my laptop,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a staple for any home not just smart one,5.0,i wa a fairly early adopter of all thing smart home even when i just had an apartment so with belkin being one of the pioneer in smart home integration it natural that i tried this out i ve used the d link smart plug a well but belkin is the best by far i now use about 4 of these and one smart switch on a daily basis the setup is simple the application allows for easy control of device whether you re home or not and even allows for custom schedule a great feature for when you re traveling and want to give off the appearance of being home i use mine mainly for light but there are so many useful feature and application for these plug light fan kid tv control wink highly recommend this,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
setup with wemo first,4.0,works well with smartthings but it must be registered to your network before it will work you first must get the wemo app and set up or register the plug after that smartthings will recognize the plug,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
easy to set up scheduling,4.0,i have purchased three of these now the oldest is only about a month old so i can not confirm the long term reliabaility but so far all work flawlessly installation using the app worked well easy to set up scheduling which worked well for aquarium light the set up to use with amazon echo dot wa very easy and seems to work without problem i also bought and own tp link and iris smart plug and the wemo is the one that work best for me and the only one of the three i would recommend,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works every day so far,5.0,i wa worried that this wouldn t work reliably as the night get cold i have to get the electric heater turned on out in the shop by 4 am some day in order to heat thing up by the time i get out there i used to have to get up crazy early to fiddle with a circuit breaker to make it happen now i just check the nightly temperature forecast pick a time and set my cell phone wemo app to turn on the heater through the wifi so far it ha worked every time and i don t have to get up early just to turn on the power and go back to bed since it ha never failed i give it five star i will say that i had to trim the casing of the other plug in the same outlet a bit so it would fit under this one but that wasn t really a big deal,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good device i wouldn t pay more than 35 for it,4.0,these thing work the way they are supposed to set up is a little bit of a pain but shouldn t take more than 15 minute to complete it s a little large but nothing that would stand out horribly this can be moved a needed a well which is one of the nice thing about this device i am using mine with alexa and have only had issue a couple of time once in like maybe 20 us alexa may say ok but it not turn it on this could be an issue with alexa not with the wemo device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not a robust a i had hoped,4.0,i love the wemo product i use them for my outside light i had originally purchased these switch to act a a two way switch for thing connected to different outlet unfortunately that didn t work there s nothing in the core programming that doe this and the partnered programming app ifttt take around 5 minute to respond i wound up downgrading to simple wireless switch to complete my pseudo two way switch which worked wonderfully overall i ll still use these switch for other purpose but know they re not a robust a they portray themselves,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
updated review it s working okay now,4.0,update some update have this working well enough now so i bought two additional one hint i have better luck using the apple version of the app on my ipod than the android version on my phone original review worked well for about a week switch no longer broadcast wifi i m giving up after 6 hour trying all of the support instruction on their website which are minimal and poor troubleshooting my wifi network including setting it up from scratch trying to contact communicated with their support etc,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
this product is a piece of junk,1.0,this product 1 is a good concept but that s all there is to it a good concept not a good product we really hoped for the best and thought wow what a great way to turn on and off our radio at home to scare away the racoon in our house or potential burglar right but no avail the product ha very poor reception in the house we have a drop cam in the same area and hand down the drop cam had better reception than this device all in all it never worked and we are happy to have returned it another irksome thing about it is that it take up the whole outlet both of them including the one on the bottom don t let the pic deceive you you will not be able to plug anything else on the outlet and the device only ha space for 1 device to be plugged in to it poor design b doe not work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
frustrating setup seems to be finally working but afraid to adjust anything further,3.0,i am a pretty tech savy guy and have lot of misc internet connected gadget and this ha probably been the most frustrating one to set up and working consistently first of all while it did initially connect using them it seems this wemo is not fully compatible with wpa2 key with special character in them it seems to only like key with letter and number after my wemo lost connectivity and had to be factory reset about 10 time i finally gave up and created virtual wifi network just for the wemo with a much simpler wpa2 key using only letter and number the app seems pretty flaky a well i use android and the app doe not appear to follow any sort of modern android ui standard it seems like something that wa ported from maybe the ios version or slapped together quickly i wa prompted to install several firmware update through the app but i ended up locking the wemo up several time during this to where it needed to be factory reset again and had to start over the firmware update ha no status bar to know when it is done it just say it will take about 10 minute and make some dumb joke about how you can go play angry birds while you wait once i got it going i went into the rule section of the app just looking around and ended up crashing the wemo during the process or it wa a good coincidence anyways so now that i got it back working again i am basically afraid to touch anything else in fear of having to factory reset it and start over again i placed a call to tech support before i figured out the whole wpa2 special character issue which they took me through some very basic troubleshooting step and then decided to elevate me to level 2 support who i have been playing phone tag with for 3 day to wrap up my long winded story it work now i don t know how reliable it will be and the firmware and app seem beta quality at best i hope it stay working i only recommend this to people with simple network key and the will to mess around with it to get it working,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works well setup somewhat confusing,4.0,works well with my echo dot hardest part wa the wemo app setup app want to send you to a tutorial that is not totally clear and won t let you transfer to the setup step during the tutorial shifting from wemo app to phone setting to alexa app wa confusing didn t try it but i wonder if the wemo app would work on a kindle fire if not then you had better have a smartphone handy or you will not be able to do the setup but after all that the switch work very well with the dot,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good for unimportant stuff but ha a major flaw for anything where staying on while you re gone is important,3.0,warning this device will keep whatever device is plugged into it off after any kind of power interruption it doe not remember whether it wa on or off when it lost power and maintain that state so instead it will default to off every time the power flicker if you just want to turn some random light appliance in your home on off and it wouldn t be an emergency if that thing stay off until you notice it this is probably a good product and priced appropriately this may or may not be an issue for you depending on your application but since i wa trying to run a water circulation pump with it to keep water line from freezing this simply wouldn t work for my application i ve gone with one of the samsung smart things hub and outlet even though they cost significantly more you get far more option to go with a correspondingly higher price tag giving it 3 star because it didn t work for me but i realize i have an unusual requirement it would be kind of annoying for most people and a nonissue for some but it really shouldn t be happening,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
unreliable at best,1.0,doesn t accept modern wifi security alpha numeric doesn t suffice for wpa2 and that is all it tolerates for your wifi passwords it is a joke that they claim that this thing is compatable i don t wish to compromise my entire network for one poorly designed device even when i tried conforming and configuring my network to satisfy their poorly published need i found the device and their software to be unreliable at best edit below is a tip directly quoted from belkin support for clarification a to my issue with this product troubleshooting your wemo connection to the wi fi network tip 4 make sure your router s wireless network ssid is set to broadcast or not hidden otherwise your wemo device may have difficulty connecting and maintaining a connection to it wemo support wpa2 password of eight 8 to 63 character comprised of letter and number only wemo will fail to connect to your network if your wireless password contains any space or symbol in it if you want to change the wireless network password of your belkin router click here,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

very impressed with the reliability of this unit after trying the cheaper model,5.0,we chose this device after trying a cheaper version that wa too unreliable we needed a remote control switch that we could rely on to reset an automation and security system while we are away from our vacation home we ve had this unit for a few month now and it ha been completely reliable when accessed and actuated remotely the price seemed too high at first but after trying the cheaper version we are happy to pay the difference to have a switch that we know will work when we need it it wa very easy to setup using ios an android we have not needed the scheduling capability but it seemed very easy and straightforward,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great for turning light on while away from house,4.0,this switch work with your wifi and allows you turn turn your light or other electronic item on and off via your cell phone this wa pretty easy to figure out and the app wa easy to find in the app store this get four star a you are supposed to be able to program specific on and off time using the app however i cannot get the program function to work with this switch and must manually turn it on and off when trying to use the program feature the switch disconnected from the app several time and had to be reset,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a must have,5.0,i purchased this for my amazon echo but didnt want to wait until i got the echo so i installed it right away took maybe 5 minute to set up and i wa able to turn my light on and off from my phone it is wonderful i used it afterwards for my christmas tree to keep from having to go behind the tree and step on the plug i got my echo for christmas and now i can turn it on and off with voice command a well i ahve since purchased three more these are a game changer,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
hit or miss be ready to return the garbage one,1.0,these thing are hit or miss and belkin know it sometimes they don t work at all and sometimes they work on the first try sometimes they work for awhile a couple of month and then they quit working i ve bought so many of these thing and had to return more than half of them be ready to test them and make sure they work and hope they work for more than a couple of month i think they ran into a bad chipmaker and didn t do qa on the production line just be ready to return them because most likely if they they don t work from the beginning they ll never work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
only buy if you have the time and patience to deal with this frustrating product,2.0,i bought this for some patio lighting and at first it worked ok for about a month it took about 20 minute to set up with my iphone 6 and an old linksys router then after a month it just stopped working no wireless network change nothing new i spent hour trying to get it to work again without success then i bought a new linksys router in dec2015 i gave it another shot and it took about 2 hr of changing network setting reading online recommendation and resetting the switch until it finally worked i m not sure what actually did the trick there is no reason it should take this much time and frustration to get something like this to work i would not recommend any one buy this unless you have the time and patience for it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
set up wa breeze integrated really nicely with alexa does not block other outlet cons,4.0,i use this with for space heater holmes portable desktop heater with comfort control thermostat and cool touch housing hfh111t nu in the basement where room get cold i have an echo in that room i can quickly say alexa turn on my heater within nanosecond the heater start working the alexa command is faster than my philips hue pros set up wa breeze integrated really nicely with alexa does not block other outlet cons wish the plug wa bit smaller,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
rubbish,1.0,i bought these 5 wemo switch plug and have nothing but trouble with them from day one 4 will work for a week or so then one will go offline it will take me hour to get it to work again after hard reset and deleting the app and reinstalling it a per customer service and bloggs and it will work for a week then another one will go offline and i have to do it all again i am finally done with them and have switched to another system which ha been in place for 1 month now with no issue very disappointment,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
alexa turn on the christmas tree,5.0,i got one of these wemo switch plug with an echo i got a second one and am currently using it for the christmas tree but plan to rename it and use it elsewhere in the house after the holiday i ve had no issue with the plug in the last 5 month since i got the first one the setup is easy and the timer is nice and simple plus you can turn your light on and off or set the timer from anywhere you have internet connection if you are looking at the light switch wall toggle replacement you have to have a third neutral wire for constant power i ordered one but had to ship it back because my old house doesn t have it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love it,5.0,have 3 of these and 2 wemo switch absolutely love how easy thing have been it wa a little confusing first setting up the turn on at sunset and off at sunrise setting but a quick youtube video helped now thing work perfectly one thing i learned wa you can add multiple rule to the device for a long time i had a monday to friday setting to have the light on in the evening when we got home until bedtime on the weekend i would have to do thing manually until i realized you could do multiple rule set now i have a bunch of rule that control morning evening and weekend life is good,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good but not the best out there,3.0,these are in general pretty good but some time they do act up and disappear from your network at random the work directly with alexa once set up correctly to power on or off a plug in appliance or lamp or the like you can also set up schedule and manipulate these applainces so long a your network is up and you have internet where you are trying to operate the switch i use these for lamp that comprise my light path so alexa tell them to turn on so i can see where i m going again once they are on and stable they are pretty solid but i ve had much fewer issue with the zwave switch and outlet that are hard wired in term of convenience though these are plug and play and a great way to make sure that home automation is something that you can or can t live without test but don t judge the current smart home technology out there by this switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love love love,5.0,i have 3 of these now and plan on getting more now that echo support wemo device i ve used them for over a year now and love having access to my light via an app and setting rule for when they come on and off and being able to turn them on off via the app it s just cheap perfect home automation my only complaint would be that they are so big they really need to work on getting them to be a smaller size otherwise they work great i use them on lamp but plan on also trying the light switch a well once you try this you ll never go back it also work on my android and ios device so even guest when they come and get on my wifi they can download the app and if they get up in the night or something they can switch on the light or talk to alexa amazon echo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wonderful product,5.0,i really like this wemo switch there were a few review that really made me skeptical especially when it came to how these work or lack there of with certain wireless condition i have a setup that people complained about so i figured i would have only mixed success with this switch turns out that when it came it work marvelously super easy to setup easy to schedule no more plucking tiny prong out of a manual timer or having to deal with lost power or timer that don t keep time right these problem are all solved with this device can t say enough great thing about it only thing i miss is the multi socket version of some timer i guess all i need to do is plug in a 3 way but it would be nice to have version of the switch that just ha extra socket another super handy feature is being able to turn anything on with a touch of a button whether it is in the app or on the device itself perfect and great thinking belkin can t wait for 3 way light switch module please hurry,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a great addition to our home security plan,4.0,useful function plus impressive result i purchased this switch for it s functionality and it delivers but it also really impress my friend based on it performance if you travel frequently you ll probably find the wemo switch useful you can turn light on and off at unpredictable time and that make home security a bit more secure plus if we re away longer than expected we can switch on a light on the way home my wife love being able to come home to a lit kitchen living room this is a great addition to our home security plan,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it is really easy to impress people with this,5.0,wow it is really easy to impress people with this my in law think i am living in the home of the fiture because i can ask alexa to turn the light on and by magic the light turn on very easy to set up work great with alexa and with the wemo app a well,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
goes off on it own once in a blue moon,3.0,i got a couple of these to allow me to restart security camera remotely it doe great except for the morning when i wake up and the camera are off and i didn t turn them off the switch turn itself off once in a blue moon i have no schedule set up or anything it just go off until i open the app and turn it on again i have now disabled remote access which basically open it up to internet to see if that solves my issue so just be cautious on what you control if it is something essential that can never go off without your permission then don t hook it up to this,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
easy set up and work great,5.0,very easy to set up and work a advertised i bought one smart plug just to see how i liked them i only use it with the app and on one plug with a light in it but it work great especially for a disabled family member who ha difficulty turning the light on and off i will definitely be purchasing more item though especially after i get an echo i ve read some complaint about issue setting this up but i had none and it took about 2 minute following the app s direction,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
does not work a advertised,1.0,does not work a advertised purchased for our cabin and tried it out at home first was very difficult to sync with our wireless but when it finally did it would work for awhile and then loose the connection 2 month later i took it to the cabin and i never could get it to work with the wireless even though it wa the same dsl provider and wireless modem a our primary residence unfortunately by then we were past the 30 day return period so now i guess all it s good for is a paper weight and probably not too good for that either,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
working great in my home theater,5.0,got this together with the wemo maker to automate my home theater i put the projector on this switch wemo bulb in my lamp and the wemo maker on my electric screen s 12v trigger port my projector doesn t have a 12v trigger for a screen so used to have to use another remote just for the screen by using recipe on ifttt com i can use my iphone to turn on the projector which also trigger the screen to come down and the light to gradually go off i set them to fade over a minute but i could do them suddenly or even slower than a minute i also have recipe to reverse everything when i turn the projector off it s fun,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
pricey with a terrible app,3.0,first of all i think all the smart outlet are way overpriced so this one is no exception in that aspect hopefully price will come down soon in order to set it up you have to install the wemo app the app is terrible and need way too many permission in the setup you have to connect to the your wifi then the outlet and then back to your wifi it connected to my smartthings hub but it is not support by belkin or samsung so if you have problem you are on your own it is working with my smartthings automation when i run discovery on my amazon echo it find it twice once in the smartthings hub and once a a stand alone device when it it function it ha few millisecond delay compared my ge z wave outlet i am planning on using all zwave but wanted to try a wifi device overall this is okay the wemo app is terrible and a security concern once i setup the device i removed the app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
does not stay connected,1.0,i ve had the switch installed 6 week and i have 7 disconnect from echo amazon rep is trying to blame belkin even though alexa claim it can t find the device it is still showing connected on my router and can be controlled from the wemo app on my cell phone i ve already spent 4 time the cost of the unit taking note talking on the phone to amazon and trying to re connect the device 4 time the re connect wa easy 2 time very difficult and this last time impossible even though i am past the 30 day window for return i will return it and if they give me a hard time i ll return the 2nd echo i purchased just to be able to activate one stupid switch i have three other brand smart plug in my shopping cart depending on amazon s response,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
perfect solution for lighting switch,5.0,we have a home business with personal fitness training from our gym wanted to add awesome lighting but didn t want to run more wire so we added the switch to the garage door opener outlet to control the led spot light and hue lightstrips connected it to our existing wemo account added it to amazon alexa and voila lights work great and customer enjoy the new set up and all i have to do is say alexa turn on the garage light thanks wemo an easy solution for a startup business mean a lot to u,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it works,5.0,this switch work with alexa and ifft and work with apps on android and ios personally i think the future of switch like this is that they work with hub that control all smart device in one place so either alexa google home siri and ifttt so far this work with 2 of these i would like to see them working with homekit though since i have a sense that one day we will find these insecure and homekit is the only framework to really take security seriously,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
reliable once you get it setup,4.0,we have 3 of these switch and each of them wa different to set up the first one wa a breeze and took about 3 5 minute the second one wa a real pain it is supposed to create it own wifi network but it wouldn t pop up on any of my device after literally day of sporadically turning thing off and on again i finally got it to work the third one miracoulously worked automatically with no issue maybe we just got a single bad one once set up they work effortlessly with the echo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wait until they work out the bug probably after 2020 sometime,2.0,i have had my belkin not wemo brand plug now for over 6 month and have loved them until i just changed router no one is not connecting and the amber light is constantly on and the timer is not working i did a factory reset and it took almost 5 attempt to set it up i installed the lastest firmware update restarted my android phone and still having issue looked for support and troubleshooting and it all read totally foreign to me,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
latest firmware update ha bricked all three of our wemo switch,1.0,we purchased three wemo switch and after the latest firmware update they won t even turn on please note this doesn t mean they can t be turned on by the app this mean they cannot even be physically switched on in short the firmware update bricked all three device simultaneously and there is no way to fix them a quick perusal of the belkin wemo tech support site will demonstrate just how not forthcoming any help is from belkin and since we are just outside of the return window amazon ha not been helpful a well,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
disappointing,1.0,i own an amazon echo and wa looking for outlet that would connect with the device i followed the direction to connect the switch to the internet through the app the connection dropped i reset everything multiple time once i got the light that wa plugged into the device to turn on and then immediately lost the internet connection i worked on it for a couple of hour but never got to the point where i could connect it to my echo i returned the device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
easy set up,4.0,set up wa very easy just follow the step in the 1 page instruction sheet setting up the rule wa a bit confusing because all of my wemo device were showing up at the same time i wanted to set up one device at a time and the symbol for more rule wa not apparent so took a while to figure out how to create multiple rule my two switch work a expected now they are now programmed to operate to mimic our normal usage while we are away from home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
needs some tweaking,3.0,it is a lot harder to setup than it need to be i have 3 of them and it took me about an hour to get them all connected to the wifi another issue with them is that every time the power flicker you lose connection and have to reconnect them every time the cable go out and you lose your internet connection you will have to reconnect them i have 1 out of the 3 that will automatically reconnect but the other two i have to go through the whole setup process my cellphone and other device automatically reconnect there is no reason these thing shouldn t other than that they work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it generally worked out of box wa best later firmware caused more problem than they fixed,4.0,update upped to 4 star firmware app issue were mostly corrected i also noticed the vacation timer mode never really worked right for me using different specific on and off time schedule worked better problems bug with device software and app will edit review if they are fixed i assume they eventually will be won t work on some of my android device and some will only work in the house wifi network and not remotely it generally worked out of box wa best later firmware caused more problem than they fixed but never really seemed to operate completely right for example i set up a timer to turn on a light for a few hour each night for some reason the light would turn itself off and on multiple time within that period and there didn t seem to be anything i could do about it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
don t bother,1.0,look the product and idea itself is great but the software is completely effed up iphone or android it doesn t matter the sunset thing doesn t work the plain time on work sort of if turning on within 30 minute before or after count a working i wa very disappointed with that i am deaf and wa going to use it a an alarm clock the turn on until time simply doesn t work i set it to turn on at 8 30 and turn off at 11pm it come on roughly 8 30ish kind of and then start turning itself off every 15 minute after that so then you re stuck with a light that you have to sign into your phone to turn on or off argh or you punch the button on the socket which is behind the bed or whatever they don t even sell plain remote with this the switch is an actual wall mounted plate switch you have to install waste of time money i don t understand this belkin is usually a much better product than this,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great wireless automation device,5.0,this is our second wemo we first used it to control our christmas tree now we control our dining room and bedroom light with them our apartment ha no overhead lighting and we have to use lamp all over installing and syncing them is really easy i think it took like 3 minute each time bonus tip we have an amazon echo which can find and control the wemo device we can just tell alexa to turn the light on and off,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great with alexa and with mobile app,5.0,really great product works very well with my echo and a simple iftt command i also like being able to use the web app to easily set a timer when i m on the road and have forgotten to do so before leaving much easier than the olden day and those dial timer that were impossible to figure out,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
worth it,4.0,home automation is far behind where it should be not that i needed this but when trying to put twin to sleep it is nice not to have to move them to get the light easy to link easy to follow the app but the app wa a little hard to find at the apple app store works with echo a long a you name your light properly had trouble when i called it my light but that changed when i renamed it mike s light the only thing i don t like is that it cover both outlet otherwise great product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
so good we keep adding more,5.0,i dipped my toe in the water and purchased one light switch i loved it and now i m up to 10 switch in my home i still plan to add more installation and setup is pleasantly simple i had never installed anything like this before but it wa easy enough to figure out lately i have been converting whole bank of switch over to wemo sometimes mixing and matching with paddle switch when necessary,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
these are great we have 3 of them,5.0,these are great we have 3 of them they all work with the amazon echo and it is super convenient they also work from a phone app so if you aren t home and want to turn on a light or if you are on vacation and don t want the house to be dark all the time you can work the outlet from the app or even set a timer they are great little device and super easy to set up,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love my wemo switch,5.0,love my wemo switch i use it every time we go out on vacation i love the ability to make my light come in when the sun go down and then off when the sun rise great product worth every penny i realize how important a good review is to a buyer i give honest and heart felt review on product that a purchase and receive i base most of my purchase on review so i understand that it is fair to be completely honest on review that being said i hope this review will help a buyer with his or her decision to buy or not buy this product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works but hard to estup,3.0,once you get it setup it doe work well i used it at christmas for the christmas light which wa nice to put on an automatic schedule on off and it wa fun to turn them on off via my smartphone but the setup process wa anything but smooth the unit act like a wifi hotspot for the initial setup which mean you tell your smartphone to connect via wireless to the wemo s wireless signal then you configure it to connect to your wireless router which mean supplying your wireless password so the wemo can connect to your network that part worked okay from there it went downhill you have to know to switch your smartphone back to your wireless network and re launch the wemo app on your phone but in my case i had to kill end task the wemo app at least once throughout the ordeal before it would connect with the wemo i think i had to also reboot turn the wemo off on too before it all worked so definitely this wa a rough setup process but the wemo worked fine afterwards,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
pain to setup but great after that,5.0,works a it should after you rack your brain trying to get it set up what should have been easy took me 30 minute the tp link smart plug i also purchased took me all of 3 minute to get running after getting this running it work a you d expect though so still 5 star,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great easy setup but large size take up space,4.0,while i can t complain about how the plug work or setting it up i can really only complain about the actual size of the plug it s quite big for just one plug i bought two one for each of my kid room so they can control their light in their room with their alexa dot when you plug it into an outlet don t expect anything else to get plugged in there so then i bought 2 belkin usb plug that have 6 outlet even with that because of the design and position of the outlet i couldn t plug in a clock or anything else so keep that in mind when purchasing it if that is the only thing you have to plug in your golden other than that no complaint maybe future technology will make plug smaller i bought these because of the good price alexa had it for,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the clapper 2 0,5.0,this is really a cool product i got it up and running in le than 5 minute i love being able to turn my lamp from anywhere whenever i want the app wa super easy to navigate the only reason i am not completely satisfied is because i purchased this to link up with my ring pro doorbell which i also love i wish there wa a setting in the ring app to turn on the light from their app the current setting just open up the wemo app this isn t necessarily wemo s fault which is why i didn t take any star off i will likely buy more wemo product in the future,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not a bad little device,5.0,i use this thing to turn on off an electric fireplace insert using my ipad there were some negative review so i wasn t sure if it wa going to be a reliable appliance or not a to get access to it i d have to dissemble the front of the fireplace i have it located inside a metal fireplace insert on a outlet i installed to power the fireplace so i wasn t sure how well it would work in that metal box the darned thing work pretty well sometimes when you start the app it spends a few second looking for the thing but it always seems to quickly find it and always turn the electric fireplace insert on off one time the app lost all contact with the thing but poking the reset restart button with a long matchstick through the front grill of the fireplace restarted it and it s worked fine since notified me there wa a firmware update but it seemed never to complete the update process but the old firmware worked just fine finally updated itself used it a couple of month now and it work pretty well if i had a use for another one i d probably buy it again a i ve had pretty good luck with this one also i m using a older linksys router and apple device to control this switch judging by some of the review it might work better with some wireless router than others,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
honestly it s probably a little pricey for what it doe but i love gadget i also only use it in the,5.0,i used this with my amazon echo and with the wemo app it doe exactly what you d expect on and off honestly it s probably a little pricey for what it doe but i love gadget i also only use it in the bedroom but it s nice to not have to get up and turn off a light if i m starting to doze also if you put this in your living room and set it up so when you arrived home it automatically turn on using ittt or some other neat app it could be really nice to not walk into a dark home i m just using it for basic on and off but it work flawlessly and ha never one time dropped a connection from wifi,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
handy but so bulky and must use extension to pair item,3.0,i use this and the mini with alexa they work a intended but both are bulky because the plug can only go in front v side so behind a furniture or in floor outlet you have the added depth of the plug you are inserting into the wemo also they should make it so you can put a pair of matching lamp into a single control instead i have to put an extension with multi outlet into the wemo just to control two lamp on same schedule,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
buggy installation process not worth the trouble,1.0,i have tried twice unsuccessfully to install this wemo switch to replace an older one that worked fine for year and then didn t i consider myself to be pretty capable in term of tech and gadget but this device failed over and over again to connect to my wireless network among other problem i read a lot of other amazon review and the support forum at wemo and it seems that i m not the only one who ran into bug throughout the installation process i don t get it connecting to a wireless network should be easy it s definitely not with this product disappointing and a waste of time,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
fun time with wifi and home automation,4.0,i travel extensively for work i m an electrician and i m always seeking way to save on the utility bill when i m not home i ve installed a nest thermostat and have seen some saving from it s auto away feature however my electric water heater doesn t have the same feature until now fully 50 of my home electricity usage is in heating water so why not shut if off when i m not home i use this switch to control a 120v coil 2 pole relay http www amazon com gp product b004z0rll2 ref oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00 ie utf8 psc 1 and have it tied to my nest thermostat s status via ifttt com whenever my thermostat go to away my water heater will be shut off a well handy,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
hardware is ok and software is hit or miss,4.0,i ended up keeping this since it still work and is controllable with software and alexa but software could use some work i got email from support about this but nothing wa really resolved,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
better than decent not quite perfected,4.0,i purchased this to use a lamp that plug in behind the couch and isn t easy to get to while it take a few second longer to open our phone open the app and hit the power button i don t mind because we control it from outside the house a well when we re about to come inside so it s a small price to pay for walking into a lit house without the waste of electricity on all day my deduction of one star come from the app sometimes it take thirty second to connect to the lamp and take another ten for the power button to turn it on this happens 10 of the time and is not something that ha caused any regret in purchasing i m still happy with it i have all apple computer and a time capsule airport extreme and this work wonderfully with it so if you are a mac person have no concern i do not use the rule but love that they re there you can program the light to automatically come on and off a you set them and i think that s great such a good idea hope this help,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it work great once it s online and active,4.0,it work great once it s online and active we use it with ifttt and control the light with google home i switched the wifi account this connected to and had to do a manual reset holding down random button for random amount of time before it would engage again moved it back to the other room and had to do it again took forever to figure out how to get the reset to happen and it to start broadcasting again that wa really annoying so i m dropping a star,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i hate led bulb so this is a great alternative,5.0,we use these with our alexa although you can use them with the app no clue what we did before these i hate led bulb so this is a great alternative i plug my regular bulb lamp into them i can turn the light on and off with my voice great since i have a 3 story house and child who are constantly leaving light on all over the place,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i can t speak of the durability of the switch yet a it ha only been installed a few week but i can say it is working great an,5.0,i have the wemo switch connected to my mother s lamp post i also gave her an amazon echo to use with it when she forgets to turn the lamp post on while she is out she asks me to turn them on for her i live 2 hour away in another state but all i have to do is say to my echo alexa turn on lamp posts and bam her light are on sure she could use the wemo app to turn them on herself but she is not that technically savvy yet i can t speak of the durability of the switch yet a it ha only been installed a few week but i can say it is working great and ha gone beyond my expectation i have not had the connectivity issue like some other user my switch ha stayed connected and ha reliably stayed connected and controlled by alexa at both my mom s house where it is installed and 120 mile away at my house via my echo note we both use and share the same amazon account allowing multiple alexa echos on the same account,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
very easy setup,5.0,the wemo switch smart plug wa very easy to set up i have to admit once you start controlling one device in your home you want to control more and more you will automatically start looking for way to incorporate more switch throughout the house i love it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
these switch work great,5.0,these do everything they say they will i can control my light using my phone or my voice with my amazon echo amazon echo they have a power switch on them too the set up wa fairly straightforward and very quick using the app on my smartphone the power switch is a negative for me right now because i have very small child who push the light the switch is a light other than that i don t have any complaint i ve never tried any other wi fi enabled switch so i have nothing to compare nevertheless i doubt i will feel the need to try anything else a these are what i needed,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
grayed out not detected until you disable remote access,3.0,took well over an hour to get this thing to work i added reset added again and each time the device would initially show up but when you click the power button it would immediately gray out and say not detected once in about 20 try it would click the switch once and then gray out after a lot of searching the web i finally discovered the trick you have to disable remote access as soon a i disabled remote access it started working fine and wa finally able to download the updated firmware and use the device and connect it to my amazon echo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well and best of all it work with echo,5.0,first there are other cheaper alternative to wifi switch plug on the market they all pretty much do and function the same which is a good thing the cost difference isn t really an issue because of this but if you want a seamless pairing with amazon echo then wemo is the way to go i ve received other brand a gift don t get me wrong i m actually using wemo and 2 other brand in my house fortunately enough i have 3 wemo device hooked up to the one i use the most,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
quit working after 5 month no support,2.0,fairly easy to install and connect to echo it worked for about 5 month and then echo said the device wa not responding i tried to set up the connection again using the wemo app but the device never transmitted the wifi signal to connect the closest thing to customer support that i could find wa a user community i never got a response to my question on how to get it working,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well but difficult set up,3.0,bought this to go along with my echo dot plugged up a lamp in the plug works really well now the most difficult part wa the initial set up of the plug it ha it s own wemo app that you download so you have to separately tell alexa to find device while you re setting up the plug with your app some other brand you can integrate the app with alexa so it can automatically link up probably wouldn t buy this one again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
solid and useful product if you can deal with the clunky sw,4.0,i now have about a dozen wemo controlled outlet and light in my house at this point other than the expense i really like these device yes the android client is pretty clunky and slow my reason for 4 start and not 5 but being able to set up one touch rule for when going on vacation and eliminating the timer on my backyard porch light and giving me one centralized spot for all my controlled light is very convenient especially when you are heading to the airport and realized you forgot to set the light to vacation mode and since they are on wifi their range is far superior to other wireless option i ve been using now for about 6 month and have not see a crash reboot yet,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well work with alexa and can tell when the sunset automatically,5.0,i ve used this for about a month with my echo unit it wa easy to set up and get them talking to each other i set the wemo app to turn on an led sconce for a dark hallway at night automatically 30 minute before sunset turn off 30 minute after sunset but if i want alexa can control it when i want i ve had two power outage which is common where i live but the wemo ha remembered it s setting after the power return critical a little expensive but i m happy overall,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
cool concept decent product poor execution and terrible app,2.0,it work but barely it will not connect to my wifi when plugged into a power strip i had to plug it into the wall outlet by itself and then it connected fine the app is rather slow and very poor ux clicking button don t give any feed back on which you click no feed back which wifi you re trying to connect to did you fat finger the wrong one who know the price is the only thing going for it the size is huge and won t fit in many outlet but when it work it s handy,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it doe what it say it doe set up,4.0,it doe what it say it doe set up is a little different with nexus 5x or 6p device need to set it to airplane mode to get it working this is not in their setup documentation the real issue i have with this device ha nothing to do with the device itself i wanted to be able to turn on my tv using this switch unfortunately the tv doesn t power on when power is present and there is no option on my tv to do so not the fault of belkin but something to consider none the le,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great idea that just isn t reliable for what is intended,1.0,this is a great concept where belkin hasn t shown the product to be ready for prime time setup is easy enough biggest problem i have are 1 after power or wifi go down the device don t reconnect reliably a manual reset of the switch is frequently necessary 2 the app is quirky often unable to show rule that were set up when running it remotely again being on the local network where the switch are is required defies the idea of reliable remote management of my device i am using these switch to manage device at our cottage so i don t have to drive 4 hour to flip a switch on any given day i can be certain that i will be able to connect remotely and be able to monitor or manage these switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i have wasted so much time attempting to get the wemo switch,1.0,i give up i have wasted so much time attempting to get the wemo switch to function properly once i think i ve got them working a they should whoop they do another firmware update and then one problem may be resolved but two new one are created by belkin these product should never have been released for sale the customer support is useless at this point the light switch all have a mind of their own and have no sense a to what time of day it is now they all come one at midnight every night,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great device,5.0,i bought this for my neurotic girlfriend that would always worry sometimes for good reason whether or not her straightener curling iron or one of her other hair torture device wa still on now she plug in to this and when we leave the house and she start worrying that she left her curling iron on she can pull up the wemo app on her phone and turn off that socket so even if she forgot to unplug or turn off something it wont burn down her house then she can relax and have a good time with me which is nice because i m pretty awesome she s never had a problem with it and even us it to freak out her roommate occasionally by plugging a lamp into it and turning it off on when she s not home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good plug when they re working,3.0,picked this up due to the price break good plug when they re working or showing in the app at least lots of time the plug is working through ifttt alexa or other third party controller but sometimes the device show a not detected in the wemo app usually in time they will mysteriously show back up but by that time i have completed the task using a different method also why no dedicated ipad version just wondering,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it work but doesn t work so well on mm,2.0,it doe work but nowhere doe it say it doesn t work with android marshmallow after trying for an hour i finally tried on an older phone and it worked right away then i can add it to the phone with marshmallow,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i also like that i can turn them on or off while,5.0,works perfectly for what i need installed in about 2 minute after downloading the app i can control my outside light or my kitchen light from my phone timed or dusk to dawn of i can voice control with alexa i just asked alexa to find new device she found them and they instantly connected i also like that i can turn them on or off while on a cellular connection in case i m running late but want a light on when i get home i will be purchasing more of these and a few light switch great product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
awesome,5.0,it wa easy to set up and it worked perfectly from the start i have three of them so far the third is a newer model and all are great i have tried using them on a daily timer specific hour using the sunset sunrise timer and using ifttt integration all three work great the only issue i ve had at all is with the app for android but it wa a minor issue and now is working fine great product highly recommend,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
doesn t work with alexa,1.0,connected to app and network and work just fine there is not discover able by alexa not wasting any more time sending them back not spending hour on something that say it can do something only to find out that it really can t shameful to sell this a compatible with your system amazon,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
pathetic,2.0,when it work it s great cannot seem to keep it connected for 1 2 day at a stretch before i have to reset it and re add it then repeat a day or 2 later,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
excellent and easy to use,5.0,i have three switch and one light switch and they are all so easy to use and set up if the power go out they all reconnect with no problem if you are using an iphone to control it there are apps you can get to use them directly from the lock screen very convenient,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
this wa my first experience,5.0,i connected my wemo to echo and an echo dot for a bedside light the process wasn t quite a straight forward a i expected but it s done and it works even my husband who would prefer telephone with dial face like being able to turn the light on without crossing the room going forward i will likely purchase additional wemo product to further automate the house,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
so much better than earlier iteration,5.0,i have had four wemo switch controlling light in our house for several year until about a year ago i dreaded installing them a their attempt to make the various wireless connection wa hit or miss something positive must have happened in the firmware or software since then because the newer one connect without frustration and don t randomly disappear from the device list like they used to they also seem to observe variable time schedule more accurately i e one hour before sunset,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
connection issue even in a small apartment,2.0,the wemo remote seemed like a great idea for fan around the apartment i bought two one for each fan they worked well for the first week after the first week they started having connection issue about 86 of the time i ask my echo to turn them on i am notified they can not be detected at first i thought it wa an issue with the echo but then i would open my wemo app and it would say they are not detected i have the firmware up to date and they should not have connection issue since i live in a small apartment with one bedroom they sit within 10 foot of the router i can only get them to work twice a day and it s never when i need them to work i would say find a different brand if you want them to be reliable and used every day,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
they always worked great with the amazon echo but would not connect right,2.0,we have multiple 3 wemo switch it took u week of lengthy call to customer service and returning a unit and more customer service call then returning another unit and finally just messing with them to get them working on our phone and ipad they always worked great with the amazon echo but would not connect right or stay connected consistently using other device they are all working perfectly now probably because we are stubborn and have the time but i can not imagine that the average person would put up with the stress and frustration of doing the same,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great entry into home automation,3.0,update recently made some change to the home wifi setup and wanted to add that reconfiguring the wemo switch wa aggravating the wemo app or hardware doe not play well after making network change therefore i changed my rating to 3 star if you re not likely to make network change then wemo switch get 4 star i chose these since they natively paired with the alexa echo and the nest thermostat the switch don t work with the auto sensing nest away mode a well a i would like but they do the job when switched away manually had to experiment with the wemo rule to get the switch to work like i wanted but that s to be expected i would like them to be a bit smaller but that s not a deal breaker by any mean,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
easy home automation,5.0,this system is brilliant i had mine up and working in just minute and it work perfectly i can imagine if your wifi signal in the house is not constant and reliable this system won t be either one other item of note if the plug are too far from the router ex router on opposite side of the house on second floor plug on the lower wall of basement it may not work reliably or connect at all i did have to put a manual timer down there a opposed to this wemo plug no harm no foul though no one go down there with any frequency and controlling upstairs to me is more important people are totally impressed with this system and it relative cost effectiveness to other system while i haven t set up the if then event i would in a proper situation i can t wait to get more component for this system and have my house fully automated,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not all it s cracked up to me and not great customer service,2.0,bought this and the orvibo brand switch together to try them out and see which if any actually worked happy to say that this plugged right in connected to my wi fi no problem and doe what it say it will do if i had ton more money i d buy them for every outlet in the house they look so sleek and smart and i love being able to set a timer so that certain appliance turn on at certain time and off at others orvibo not so much definitely returned it and am sold on the wemo revised 11 3 17 i had this product for a few month and then suddenly it stopped working no apparent reason i ve tried getting in the belkin website to try and return it or file a claim or something but no such luck will not be buying belkin again and wouldn t suggest this product to anyone so disappointing,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works with the echo but also the wemo app,5.0,does what it say on the box this plug will let you turn on or off any outlet either through voice command through the echo or the wemo app on it own an added bonus i didn t realize when initially purchasing wa that i could actually utilize the wemo app from anywhere shouting at the wall to turn off the light is one thing but turning on the ac window unit so your house is the right temp right when you get home that s easily worth the sticker price,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a great device for automation,4.0,i love using the wemo i give it a 4 5 star because the setup can be a bit tricky and painstakingly long i m not quite sure why it s not a smooth process for all wifi network but this is the second one i have purchased that ha taken multiple attempt to setup i use my wemos to schedule the lighting i use for my fish tank this is really important for planted tank to provide consistent lighting duration with this product i am able to remotely check if my light are on or off remotely turn my light on or off and set up a rule that if i turn my light on outside of the scheduled time i can have them automatically turn off after x amount of time this ensures i don t accidentally leave the light on overnight all in all this is a great product that ha a few little flaw but hopefully will be updated and fixed in further firmware update,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love the idea of being able to set on off time,1.0,love the idea of being able to set on off time control remotely etc however i have never been able to get this set up properly i ve followed every trouble shooting advice changed my wifi password because it had a special character reset the device to factory setting multiple time etc nothing ha worked very frustrated,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
simplifies my life,5.0,i use this with alexa for a light to turn off and on does make my life easier not sure if ill get lazy with all these sweet gadget it is nice to say alexa turn on light and it doe if i don t want to yell at night to alexa to turn off light a others are sleeping i just use app on phone to turn off light its alot easier then trying to reach up to lamp to turn off a i have bad shoulder,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
save you money find a different option,1.0,it always say not detected sent feedback back to wemo belkin this is pointless if it only work 10 of the time and everything else on the internet doe work except this save your money this is so frustrating,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
some worked some didn t,2.0,i bought a few of these device a few of the insight switch and 2 wemo light switch the light switch worked without too much of any glitch i got one insight switch to work just perfectly but now i have 5 switch and insight switch which won t work i have spent month online reading up tip guide hint and help faqs nothing seems to work i m even more frustrated now it seems i ve missed my return deadline by a month i d still like to have what these device promised but i feel like i got robbed,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
received open box item it didn t work,2.0,i can t say whether this switch will do it job or not the item i received wa in an open box and it didn t work the led would light but it would not sync with any of four different wifi device correction my original comment said bluetooth with the wemo app i spent at least several hour on the belkin wemo troubleshooting page and with technical support i reset the device etc etc i sent the item back to amazon and they refunded my money immediately i am guessing that someone had already returned this specific example but based on the feedback on the belkin site it appears that these device may have a problematic design or firmware i e sometimes they work sometimes they don t and sometimes they quit it is a great concept but i ll wait for the next generation device before i try this again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
only work 50 of the time,1.0,nice switch when it works which is only about 50 of the time i bought 2 of these over the last couple of year before there were other product on the market they are terrible only connect to the internet about 50 of the time half of the time when i try and turn the switch on or off with the app the switch is not connected to the internet terrible instruction documentation i will never by another wemo product there are now many other cheaper alternative on the market,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
just awful,1.0,if you re buying this to link with the amazon echo dont does not work with the amazon echo it keep disconnecting to the amazon echo and to the wifi link an expensive waste of time and money,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not ready a a common household item,1.0,frustrating with constant trouble shooting firmware seems to require complete reconfigure after resetting to factory default i have owned these for 4 month and had to do this 3 time being a geek with it skill i find this product annoying i can get them back up and running but usually take about 15 to 20 minute per switch waste of time when you consider the goal of what it is replacing,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
compatible with the amazon echo,5.0,i purchased two of these a couple week ago and the set up wa flawless and they work perfectly however these two additional unit cannot connect to the wemo server and thus cannot be activated i don t know why this is an issue and have yet to hear from the belkin people on what the issue is and how to address it for correct installation and use with amazon echo addendum i sent them back and received replacement same issue using the wemo app with my ipad io 9 1 kathrena from belkin who ha been working with me on this suggested that i might use another device to see if we could isolate the problem area i used my kindle fire and lo and behold the device fired right up the wemo app worked just fine and the issue is resolved don t know what the problem wa with the ipad but the app just did not work perhaps the belkin folk might just want to update their app a bit anyhow with all issue resolved i am most happy with the wemos doing what they are supposed do they work fine and i endorse the product without reservation at all thanks for all the help from the belkin people and especially kathrena who baby walked me through all of this,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great now using it for washing machine notification important washing machine tip,4.0,i use a wemo in wall switch a couple of their plug in switch a wemo maker on my garage door now an insight switch to notify me my wife when the washing machine is finished important washing machine tip below the setup is still a little flakey otherwise it would be 5 star but other than that i am very pleased tip for wash notification the insight switch will send you a message when power stops being used when the washer or whatever is finished initially it wa sending notification 4 time during the wash cycle a the washer changed cycle in the app under setup for the insight switch there is a setting for the on standby threshold changing this from 8 watt default to 2 watt resolved the issue and now it only sends the notification when the load is completely finished it took me a while to resolve that but hopefully this will solve the issue for others,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works a described but you cannot control two different house using the ios app,3.0,works a described i ended up purchasing this to turn on my foscam camera when i leave a geo fence via ifttt and turn off my foscam security camera when i approach home the only thing i dislike about this is that from the mobile app you cannot control device that sit in two home i d love to check the status of my device in my sf home a well a in my la home unfortunately this isn t possible and the set up requires you to be on your local network for set up,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the thing work fine for 1 4 week at a time,1.0,this one wa a replacement for one that already stopped working after just a couple week the thing work fine for 1 4 week at a time then it simply stop functioning sometimes you can get it to work again by resetting everything but other time you have to just use it a a manual switch i will never buy another wemo device again this item deserves negative star,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
belkin s customer support is good,4.0,we initially had some problem connecting this to our network ended up being that my phone wa connecting to a different frequency from what the wemo switch needed once i temporarily shut off 5ghz frequency and forced my phone to connect to the 2 4 ghz the switch connected like a dream now we use our echo to turn the light off and it s quite a fun party trick and even though i searched high and low on the internet for the above answer i couldn t find it belkin s customer support team wa great and got the solution right on the first try so don t waste to much of your time troubleshooting this if it doesn t work for you right away just email them,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i got this to work with alexa,5.0,it take a bit to set up sometimes but when set up it work very very well the set up app is a phone app but that can be used on an android device like a kindle also accepts ifttt for option i have mine behind some metal shelving which sometimes will interfere with the item being turned on or off but usually voice command only take asking twice and it work 90 of the time without problem,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
device is great app is not so much,4.0,a bit difficult to set up even with the included hint and trick with the instruction my recommendation is to shut off mobile data a well a the other suggestion in the instruction to ensure proper and prompt configuration i have not had any issue with the device disconnecting and i am able to control the light over any wifi or cell network my only wish wa that the app wa better the rule and away mode setup is cumbersome to say the least it also lack the ability to set a on off time that is automatically variable for the appearance of random on off time something that many non connected timer do and is very useful for those who travel,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the idea here is great but i find that i often have to,3.0,the idea here is great but i find that i often have to manually power it back on completely defeating the purpose they do have active support and i ve had several update and beta opportunity so i feel like they are trying to make thing right otherwise i would have rated it much lower,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
did not work with my amazon echo device,1.0,bought this since it wa suggested a a product to go with my new amazon echo and nowhere could i get the echo to find the device and no where on any website could i get the support i needed to make it work paid money to buy an app that wa supposed to make it work and it still would not work returned it quickly and thankfully amazon make return easy going to try the tcp link smart plug since at least on that website there is support available to help you get the plug to work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the product work well the app need an updtate,4.0,i wa nervous when i first set this up it wa unresponsive had difficultiy connecting to my network however i tried setting it up with a different device same os and it led me to update the wemo s internal firmware after this the device ha worked perfectly i wish the app wa a little better put together and that it wa clearer what the wemo wa doing perhaps sending a connecting or updating message to the app the device take up a lot of space and could be nicer to look at but it work programming the timer function wa simple enough and being able to warm up my espresso machine before i leave for home is wonderful,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
sounds super cool but doesnt work consistently,1.0,this switch is a joke it work half the time literally the app constantly ha upgrade that won t allow you to run whatever you want to turn on until it s finished downloading i really thought this would be cool to have but i think i will go back to my 2 timer that work every time this hook to wi fi a pretty easy but after a month or so you have to reset it so if it in the attic or something hard to get to it s going to be a pain to reset it it literally stop working randomly day today sorry for the bad review but the truth hurt sometimes,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
what a huge disappointment,1.0,i recently got an amazon echo and i decided to try to use smart switch to jazz up the control of the electronics that i use i got the switch for my light the setup for of the wemo switch wa very easy for me i wa able to get it to connect to my wifi network with no issue i also got alexa to notice the smart home device and to add it also using the voice command wa no issue the reason for the one star rating from me is two fold first the switch only stay connected to wi fi about two day at a time after that when you try to use alexa to turn on the switch it will tell you that the device is not responding so you need to disconnect it and re connect it to the outlet it is on and again this will work for about 2 day before you need to do it again it doe not matter if you reset it to factory default it will do the same thing again i contacted belkin support about this and i told the representative there that i reset to factory default about 10 time and the issue kept happening i wa told to try the same thing again and also to try to do it with cellular data disabled on my cell phone that would have no effect because you have to use wifi to set it up i had both my cell phone and the switch on the same wifi network and it would still inexplicably lose connection i got the tp link smart switch instead and i have had absolutely no disconnect from the wifi network ever and also no issue with alexa this switch doe not work and then belkin support is atrocious a far a honoring the warranty they are supposed to have on these device i am not sure what is happening to belkin but their product and quality is slipping i would not buy any of these switch again nor would i recommend it to anyone,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
piece of cake cool cool cool,5.0,i bought 2 of these and both worked flawlessly i don t know how it could be any easier plugged the switch in connected my iphone to the wemo wifi 15 second later i had control of the switch maybe these are newer dec 16 compared to the folk who had problem but don t hesitate these switch do what they say they will do programming rule is pretty straightforward pretty cool i can do it on my phone and not have to fiddle with a mechanical switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
piece of junk,1.0,piece of junk stopped working 3 minute after plugged in wifi wa detected at first but then went in and out and after about 10 minute wasn t visible at all,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great,5.0,this work perfect i really don t see what everyone is complaining about had it for a while using just the app a little slow to respond but it worked then i connected this switch to ifttt and alexa that opened up the possibility but slowed down the reaction time to about a 3 to 5 second delay still worked great i currently have this switch connected to my living room a c unit with samsung smartthings hub and alexa works flawless no delay no setup issue,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
frustratingly successful,4.0,ordered 2 to accompany my recently purchased amazon dot the first took about 20 attempt to connect with the smartphone app then came the hassle of activating the switch via alexa a day later i attempted to connect the second switch it literally took about 80 attempt to make the connection to the app another 20 try to activate the connection via alexa i couldn t tell whether the issue wa with my internet service my smartphone the dot or the switch itself i can t even tell you how i accomplished the task what is now clear however is that once connected you still have to create a device account with alexa since their successful activation both have worked flawlessly and yes i plan to buy more,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
software is poorly thought out,1.0,if you own a drop cam you will appreciate this review i originally purchased this device because i wanted to be able to control drop cam connected to them which sometimes go off line and need to be re booted herein lie the problem if you are not on the original network which the wemo wa set up on you cannot create a remote access to those device totally unlike the software in the drop cam that you create an account and then anyone regardless of the network they are on can access those camera with a password this is not good belkin this should have been better thought out if you intend on using this device between two phone say a couple for example and you live in different part a we do this will not work unless both phone were on the network same network in order to configure the device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great product but even better customer service,5.0,great product but even better customer service i bought this a my 11th wemo device so i am pretty familiar with the product line up although i did all the previous app installs this one gave me a little trouble at first so i used the in app help and had someone email the same night with exactly what i needed the product is solid but the feedback function of the app will keep me coming back,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
pretty cool echo user,4.0,had a little bit of trouble connecting the device to wifi even though on the wemo app it said the connection failed it actually didn t because when i closed the app and opened it again it said connected for echo user it s important to note your echo will not detect the device until you set them up on your wemo app first even if you don t plan on using the wemo app you still have to download it and set it up also on their customer support page there is a link that say premium support that indicates for a fee you can talk to a person on the phone what isn t apparent unless you read the fine print is that the first 90 day is free so if you need help setting up the device just give them a call 800 223 5546 i would have gave this product five star if the device came with a power regulator that would allow for you to control the brightness of the lamp that s being plugged into the device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i must have got a bad switch it is a piece of garbage,1.0,i must have got a bad switch it power on once i close the app it stop working i followed the guide on the box app and youtube i have tried to set it up 8 time it allows me to go through the setup and connect and then it drop device not detected i reset it multiple time i reconfigured it multiple time i rebooted my phone multiple time i deleted and reinstalled the wemo app multiple time alexa cannot find the device it is a piece of garbage i am so frustrated with it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
do not buy this plug,1.0,the switch seemed great for the one day it worked it wa hard to connect to wifi a it continually could not connect despite finding the network and having the password now it loses the connection and you have to manually reset it to have it find the network again even when using the power button on the plug to use it just a a switch the light will turn off after a period of time this is a useless piece of plastic and i ll be looking for a different smart plug in the hope of actually getting a smart one,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
work perfectly i have this controlling a fan in,5.0,work perfectly i have this controlling a fan in my bedroom and connected to amazon dot so i say alexandra fan on and the fan go off the neat thing i wa able to program it to auto shutoff after 30 minute when turned off after midnight but it run till turned off again during the day very slick and the only solution i could find to do this works flawlessly,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
they ve definitely grown on me,4.0,update after 9 month use i m adding two star for two reason first firmware update release note tell me that belkin is addressing concern from amazon review especially in improving router ssid and password compatibility second echo and our wemo switch work together perfectly such that we only bother with the app to set timer these are pretty nice and certainly better than the two star that i d originally rated them original review now that we ve got them set up they re alright when we have 15 to 30 free second to launch an app and wait for it to connect to a couple of outlet five foot from the phone getting to this point required much patience and googling defaulting my router s ssid and password and upgrading wemo firmware a few time so that i d be able to restore the router setting hoping that belkin is now shipping with firmware already updated because that wa seriously a pain in the neck,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
worth the buy but beware the troubleshooting,4.0,first off i would like to say that the product presentation is nice the cardboard really hold the switch in there the original switch is a bit clunky but they have since improved that with the mini resetting this is also a bit awkward the instruction really should be in the app or printed on the back so keep your manual handy or be prepared for a bit of internet troubleshooting setup for this thing is a bit of a pain but once you get the hang of it it not that hard functionality is good and the switch syncs up well with amazon alexa which is also a fairly time consuming process i ve docked a star for setup and troubleshooting issue giving the app it own help tab could probably fix this but i would still consider this a good product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo and alexa unite,5.0,kitchen light went out and i am unable to get on the ladder to take the top off to get to the light bulb so i can buy a new one so i hooked up a desk lamp i use my amazon echo alexa kitchen on and voila better than a light switch i love it my daughter us it to turn the light on when she work late so the dog is not in the dark lol yes this is a keeper,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
problems with set up,1.0,i thought this would be a great product to combine with my new amazon echo boy wa i wrong on this the echo work fine but this switch is impossible to set up i went to their website to find out how to set it up totally worthless i downloaded the app and again that wa also worthless i searched the question area on amazon and again no help so i guess this will have to go back and i will put my money on one of their competitor next time belkin get it together before you put out a product as i write this 28 percent of respondent gave your product one stat in my mind that is significant,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
they work beautifully,5.0,they work beautifully with the app and with echo i had trouble reconnecting after having a new router installed so i used belkin s troubleshooting chat option the tech spent a long time with me until all my switches were working again both with the app and echo he could not have been more helpful or patient love being able to turn the light on if we re getting home later than planned and to be able to turn them on using echo in the middle of the night,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i would not recommend any wemo product unless you are very computer savvy,3.0,switches work well if you can get them hooked into your wifi network there are some obtuse written faq on the subject but they are difficult to understand telephone support is in india and the accent are so thick i could only understand every third or fourth word i wa able to get them working finally thanks to some you tube video there are some paid telephone support option which i would have paid for but they are also based in india don t buy unless you are willing to support yourself i would not recommend any wemo product unless you are very computer savvy,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
expensive non working toy,1.0,worked after a maddening set up then stopped working i reset it and it worked then just stopped light wouldn t even come on when i plugged it in tried all the you tube fix nothing worked got instruction from belkin no help shut down modem monitor all thing computer bluetooth everything tried again no success luckily amazon ha an easy return policy so it s back with them the end,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
excellent product i have 2 of these wemo smart,5.0,excellent product i have 2 of these wemo smart plug and have installed the app to my iphone set up and install wa easy and the app give periodic update to the app and the device a well there is also a timer feature in the app which can turn the switch on and off at specified time i have one timer set to turn on a radio during the day and the other timer set to turn on a light during the evening helps give the appearance to would be robber that someone is home have recommended to friend a well,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well also support scheduled event but poorly documented scheduled event won t work if internet connection is lost,4.0,works well i installed and accepted the option to upgrade to the latest firmware version on 11 7 2015 and have been running it for almost 2 week now you can access the device from anywhere using your iphone a long a you can connect to internet via either wifi or your cellular data plan the device s connection to your home wifi is pretty stable and it auto reconnects well in case it loses the connection i had tried a similar device that became unusable a soon a it lost the wifi connection one time so this is important because connection sometimes lapse for a few second and you normally don t notice you can set up rule to power on and off on a schedule the schedule can be very specific you can set each rule to run at a specific time and day or day of the week you can edit and enable disable the rule remotely there is apparently no limit to the number of rule you can set up i set up 5 with no limit in sight unfortunately the rule will not run if the device loses it connection to the internet the documentation is poor in this regard a it contradicts itself but i speak from experience,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
pros it is very easy to set up if you follow the instruction,5.0,i now have 5 of these and i use them with alexa pros it is very easy to set up if you follow the instruction commands through alexa echo are very intuitive unlike the philips hue which you have to train yourself to use mobile software is good and easy to use you can position it where it only take one socket space cons none so far,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
simple to setup and use,5.0,so simple to setup and use did i remember to turn a light on for the dog with remote access enabled you can control your wemo device from anywhere your ios or android device ha an internet connection this includes other wi fi network or your 3g 4g mobile connection when the wemo app is launched outside your home the app contact the belkin cloud where it redirects the phone s request to the appropriate wemo unit and then you can see and control all of your wemo device nice integrates perfectly with amazon echo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
never go home to a dark house,5.0,great little plug we love that we can control our light from our phone at first i thought this wa a lazy option but i never have to walk into a dark house we very often are out longer than planned and don t remember to turn on light before we go now i open the app and i can turn on the light the only downside wa poor installation instruction but google helped with that,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

to try my luck at starting a hand free smart home set up,4.0,i bought a couple of these just to try my luck at starting a hand free smart home set up initial set up of each one varied but took a little le than a minute before it became recognized by my network for first time use i would recommend setting it up closer to your router to program a it seemed to struggle a bit being a couple floor up in my townhouse but once set up i ve had no problem in switching it to any outlet or floor in the house and it working fine the only criticism i had wa the size which made it a little tricky to get into an outlet behind some furniture and is fairly noticeable to anyone in an open room no complaint otherwise for those looking for a sleeker le noticeable version i highly recommend the new wemo mini or insight plug,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
recommend this one,5.0,love these unit so much so that i purchased two more lol use my smartphone to turn on and off light in house when i am their oh bet thing i am able to turn on light over 1000 mile away very easy to set up and use,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

bad luck or bad product,2.0,i purchased three of these for a work project unfortunately 2 out of the 3 didn t properly work one of them would not allow me to upgrade the firmware even after reaching out to the vendor for help with known security issue in older firmware this made this unit unusable the second unit never created a connection with my or any coworkers phone the light never blinked the proper color and it wa never usable the third unit connected right away and had no problem i gave this 2 star for what this product can do when it work it s very cool the ifttt recipe are a nice way to expand functionality and i wa able to control the switch using both email and text a well a from the app directly everyone at work thought the functioning unit wa great and we had a lot of fun with it the problem with reliability is killing the product i can t trust it to function and with only 1 out of 3 unit working i can t recommend it too bad,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good product room for improvement,3.0,interesting product works once you get it all setup with the app on the iphone and the echo dot a little bulky and cover the whole outlet slot which prevents the outlet above from being used on a vertical 2 x power socket plate very disappointed that it doe not work on 5ghz frequency and not on 40mhz band had to change my router setting for the test but once it work it work well however i won t be using it due to the config change needed on my router overall a good product i may have received an older version or the product firmware need to be updated to work with 5ghz frequency and 40mhz band,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
easy to set up,5.0,i have one of those marquee with the flashing arrow at the entry of my little vacation cabin i rent i am on the highway so it could be a little challenging to find me in the dark i had one of those little timer with the dial so i would have to go down to the sign and over ride the timer if someone wa going to be arriving after midnight i actually seldom did that but now i have timer assigned to that switch to turn the sign on at sunset and shut off at 10pm sun thur then at midnight fri sat i can manually turn the sign back on at 10pm and it will automatically turn off at 1am thanks to a timer the option are pretty much endless and i can turn it off and on from my bed too or anywhere that my phone ha an internet connection i am ordering a switch for to covered deck in the park the price is worth the convenience,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

these switch are terrible,1.0,don t ever buy this product i purchased 4 of them during amazon prime day and i m assuming i just received one that did not work and were previously returned by other customer regardless all 4 of these do not work i ve tried changing the setting on the wifi hard reset uninstalling and re installing the app and still nothing work seriously save yourself the aggravation and go to another brand i m sure that some of these product have worked for some people but it truly seems to be a lottery of whether or not you get a working one shame on me for not doing more research prior to purchase but either way these switch are terrible,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not worth the setup time and frustration but work a expected,3.0,it work a expected but after a long frustrating process of setting it up it took me over an hour and the customer support wa horrible they ask you for a lot of personal information before letting you know you called the wrong number lol,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
but once you get it they are lot of fun and very useful,5.0,much room for improvement in the documentation but once you get it they are lot of fun and very useful it s ok to get home in the dark having forgotten to leave light on also never kick anything in the dark again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good stuff that work every time,4.0,we have three of them in use all connected to amazon echo alexa it s so nice and easy to tell alexa to turn on a light or the fan rather than walking across the room to turn something on or off the wemo app is easy to setup and it ha programmable timer i just wish it wa smaller i just received the new wemo mini plug and will see how that work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
easy to install and set up with the wemo software,5.0,easy to install and set up with the wemo software on my iphone i tried a competitor s product from d link it wa amazingly difficult to setup and we never succeeded so we returned it to amazon the wemo by comparison wa simple and setup worked the first time switch is in a garage location separated by very thick garage firewall but work fine on the wifi of a router 30 foot away and one floor above the garage we have had other wifi device not work in the garage they reported a weak wifi signal the wimo switch work great and i love the wemo phone app so easy to use,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
when it work,2.0,this product is a good idea but is very poorly supported by belkin app and firmware update consistently break function which might be fixed in the next app or firmware update at the expense of something else breaking when they are working they won t function with mac filtering enabled on your wifi network yes even with the mac address entered into the wireless router a exception they have to be reset semi weekly a their internal clock fall out of sync they are only accessible through android or ios apps no access from pc s belkin s support is quick to reply but doesn t actually do anything to fix problem they just keep recommending uninstalling reinstalling the app or completely resetting the wemo switch which doesn t actually do anything other than consume hour of time resetting everything only to have the exact same problem my day job is a an it administrator and this poorly supported designed technology frustrates me i can only imagine how much more frustrating wemo must be for someone who doesn t live and breath troubleshooting network hardware i m beginning to wish i hadn t wasted the money on this product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
makes my life so much easier,5.0,when this thing work it is awesome it ha made my life so much easier easy and straight forward to setup mine failed after a while but i wa using it to control light on a saltwater fish tank not many thing can last very long around saltwater so i can t really blame that on the product itself i wa using it for something it wasn t really designed for,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
overall yeah i like it,4.0,i really like this product but the only reason i give it four star rather than five for two reason 1 it s very chunky so you can t use two in one outlet box so i have had to buy adapter etc i m sure a the technology improves like all thing these will get smaller 2 the app is really annoying to me and a bit glitchy and is always prompting me to update it firmware or whatever now that i have the echo i just use her to control the switch so i never have to go on that crappy app again but for those without echo you will have to use the stupid app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
don t hesitate everyone can benefit by using these,5.0,love these used for three week and no issue whatsoever easy set up great idea,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
does not work reliably at least with amazon echo,2.0,if you re just looking for a switch to operate with an app on your smartphone this product fill the bill nicely however if you re looking for a switch to interface with your amazon echo alexa and operate with voice command this product doe not fill the bill very well i set everything up a instructed and the switch worked flawlessly from the wemo smartphone app but when i gave alexa command to operate the device 93 of the time i either got a message that the device could not be found or a message that the device wasn t responding 7 of the time the command resulted in operation of the switch i moved the switch to various location throughout my home with the exact same result if you want your connected home device to work correctly and reliable there is seemingly no replacement for a hub to interface with amazon echo and operate those device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
do not buy,1.0,worst thing i have ever gotten i will never buy another belkin product a long a i live there customer service is not american based and it just make thing very difficult they are not able to understand the real problem and how to fix it besides what their computer tell them you are better off just searching google the wemo switch lasted 2 month and then it finally stopped connecting to my wifi network i bought 3 of them in december 2014 and all of them are already broken the iphone app is unbelievably buggy just look at the app store rating please do yourself a favor and do not buy this product i just bought 3 ankuoo neo plug and they are wonderful it took le than 2 minute to setup all 3 of them up they are cheaper and smaller than the wemo switch a well,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i don t like the wemo software at all,2.0,i don t like the wemo software at all i ve got a half dozen of these switch at two location but the software can t handle that i have to run one location with the app on my iphone and the second location with the app installed on my ipad i ve also given a switch to a friend who set it up behind a comcast router after several call to wemo and comcast tech support he gave up trying to set it up,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good switch the mini is probably a better choice for most,4.0,works a advertised version two is much smaller down side to this one is that you can only put it in the top slot of a plug otherwise it will cover the second slot also keep in mi d if you use this for a lamp you have to get in the habit of turning the lamp off with the wemo my fience is constantly turning off the lamp normally so then the switch won t turn the light back on and visa versa we might have to switch lamp other downside is that sometimes it loos connection with the network seems to fix thing once i launch the app this is a bit annoying because it affect the google home command and the quick switch widget on my android phone all in all it is great to be able to turn off item via internet even when i m not home and wemo product don t need an additional hub either,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

good hardware stupid apps,3.0,the switch itself work fine but the wemo app is suck it s very heavy over the 100mb and slow when you set it up once the apps and the switch work fine and stable but the setup process is very cumbersome and the biggest problem is that you can not set it up in remote if you get new cellphone and you want to transfer the apps and your setting to the new phone you need to be in the same wifi location with the switch basically i like belkin s product but their software team is not good a their hardware team,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

both product have been fantastic thus far,5.0,i have a wemo light switch installed and i ve recently added two of the wemo switch to our setup to control the light on our outdoor bar both product have been fantastic thus far the app is simple and easy to use setup went smoothly and all switch connected in little to no time on our home network the wemo rule are simple and effective i like being able to setup different light scenario when we go out of town and have them saved in the app we control everything with amazon echo and the integration is seamless thus far over all good stuff recommend,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it seems to be working fine once i played these game but i may not,3.0,product detail say app will work with any ios 5 or later belkin site say ios7 not true i tried to download the wemo app on my ios 7 which is up to date and the app store say no it ha to be ios 8 i never wanted to be involved in os compatibility issue just to install this but i did find a way to download older version of apps here this workaround worked even though my desktop is window not mac more time than i want to invest also try finding out what the little light on the switch mean google for a user manual and you can t get a simple answer it seems to be working fine once i played these game but i may not install a many wemos a i once contemplated,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
love my wemo,5.0,i love wemo product by belkin they are super easy to set up and work great off my wifi i can look at my house inside at anytime from anywhere i can also turn light on or off from any location i like being able to turn my front porch light on at night when i m away before i return i highly recommend the product i wish they made an outdoor camera,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
will not connect to router,1.0,will not connect to airport extreme or att u verse router i ve read a few other review and my experience duplicate theirs correct password used on multiple device but the wemo refuse to connect i chatted with belkin support and they were slow to respond we walked through the instruction and change to the airport extreme but no luck it seemed obvious the rep wa running through a script in the end i am disappointed and will return the order,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
funny phrase written by a software developer trying to create,5.0,this device now work well with echo it drove me bonkers trying to setup remote access in the wemo app so that it could then be detectable by echo and amazon had no clue why i would get this error sorry we were unable to setup your remote access just now to try later go to more remote access funny phrase written by a software developer trying to create an error message that ha multiple us while trying to sound eloquent lol it should say something like your version of ios is incompatible with remote access setup since simply trying again by itself won t resolve the issue oh and wemo belkin wa closed when i wa doing this stuff anyway i finally figured it out as you can probably guess from my suggested error message change my version of ios is incompatible i am using a new beta version of the iphone ios which doesn t allow the setup process to work properly with the wemo app you must have remote access enabled in order to make it discoverable by echo i ultimately used my ipad to set it up and it worked perfectly in fact i thought i would have to enable remote access a a manual step but once i wa using a compatible version of ios it did that on it own a part of the automatic setup process i then went back to echo alexa and asked her to detect device to setup and she found them finally so if you re on any sort of beta ios for the iphone either use a different device or go back to the regular current ios version i think people might have the same problem using an old ios version the setup from the wemo app wa easy after that and don t forget that wemo switch only work on the 2 4 ghz frequency i didn t know that upon purchase but got lucky and my netgear modem router combo wa 2 4 compatible you must also have upnp enabled enabled by default but could be disabled by an installer or even you for security concern i guess if anybody wants the wemo echo setup to work guaranteed with no hassle just buy a new 2 4 ghz modem with it which will have upnp turned on by default and use the correct ios version as long a you don t have any issue with signal being blocked at home i d imagine it would be pretty much plug and play,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the switch are great it s the app that need work,4.0,i have three switch that i use in a three story house in order to have wifi on all three level of the house we have a wireless router and two waps that extend the original signal from the router it take forever for the app to come up and allow me to access the switch when i say forever it would on many occasion be quicker for me to walk down two flight of stair and turn the switch off manually and then get on with my day being able to check whether or not switch are on or off on the different level of the house is really helpful at the end of the day it would do me good to just walk down two flight of stair and turn the switch off however i paid 50 for the switch to do that so my expectation are a little frustrated by the really slow wemo app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
too pricy for what you get,3.0,while a fun gimmick they were a pain to connect the software at install constantly crash and the remote feature only work on 2 of the 4 switch i got a it say when i leave the house that the two are off line they immediately work when i get back home on wifi the reason i got them wa to turn light on and off while i am away remotely if i leave and the remote shuts itself down what s the point however i did use these to set up timer around the house so when i wake up the light and appliance are waiting for me fun to play with at home wifi useless and unreliable if you try the remote feature i emailed support and got a form letter clearly written by a computer that didn t even address my concern would not buy again,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
pretty good product software could be more intuitive,4.0,just got my belkin switch downloaded the app from apple app store and proceeded to set it up had to do a firmware update which take about 10 minute a stated in the app got it working on the wifi and discovered you have to also set it up for use on any internet connection all in all thing went smoothly and it work great don t know what the fuss wa with some reviewer the instruction were somewhat rudimentary and were included in the app a little pricey initially a with any new technology hopefully the price will drop in time i would recommend this product and plan to buy more wemo product for my home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
nice except for set up,3.0,nice after you get it working but setting it up wa a lot harder than it should have been several time i wa getting a message that the device wa not detected almost sent it back but decided to try again finally got it working by doing the same thing i did before over and over no rhyme or reason a to why set up took so long,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
fantastic throw your old fashion timer away,5.0,i ve got 4 of these around my house and i love them they have replaced older timer i had various accent and decorative light around my home instead of the constant adjustment throughout the season and year i now just set these to turn on 15 min after dusk they are connected and smart they know when dusk is automatically each day every day,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
one of my favorite gagets,5.0,i love these only trouble i ever had is when i changed router i believe if you keep same name on your wifi router nothing would change so next time if you do change router all these wemo s are easier to deal with if you just reset them back to factory only way i got them to work then but i really love them own more than 10 now some are wall switch i have them for my fish tank outside xmas light walkway light pump for my hot water cir pump and keep thinking of new thing all the time,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great with echo phone,5.0,we order 1 and love it just ordered 2 more works great with our echo and we now control our light via voice through our echo works outstanding with our phone a well wife can turn on the light via her phone when she pull the car into the garage and make sure there is light on when she enters the home during those dark winter month,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
kept going offline requiring a manual switch push to get it back,3.0,meh not a great a i hoped based on review i m an it guy so i have a certain expectation based on using a variety of tech based thing over the year app is a bit misleading and it took me a while to get thing set up based on that things didn t work a seamlessly for me a they did for others eventually i wa able to get thing online and functioning and a firmware update came up and i installed it when trying to set up a basic on off event it wasn t a intuitive a it should be once i had a couple basic on off event set up i used this for a week but i had to turn the unit back on manually with the power button and this wa the deal breaker doesn t do much good to schedule thing to run automatically when the unit go offline by itself and can t be accessed remotely with the phone app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i would like to have more for a few other thing in,5.0,haven t had it for long but it work perfectly a advertised not too hard to program i have it to come on at sunset and shut off at 10 00pm for patio light the only con is the price i would like to have more for a few other thing in my house but it just wayyyy to expensive for me although with christmas coming i might break down and buy the insight switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good but issue after a power outage,4.0,so far i like all the feature of the switch but it ha 1 flaw which is talked about by others if there is a power outage the switch come back in an off state regardless of what state it wa on when the power went off this is very annoying and they should instead provide a user selectable setting a to whether you want it to default to on off or whatever state it wa in when the outage occurs until then the workaround that i use it to create a lot of rule at 5 minute increment that turn it on that way i will only be out 4 minute at the longest until it come back on i use it a a timer for an appliance and this work for me but might not work for everyone if your switch is on for a very long period of time i hope they fix this flaw in the design of the product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
seems to have been improved since release,5.0,a few thing to keep in mind for my review 1 i am primarily using these with amazon echo which is a different experience than the app 2 these seem to have been improved since release when i wa setting both of mine up they both needed a firmware update which took a couple of minute it look like belkin ha improved the software powering these since they were released over 2 year ago some of the review here are a couple of year old so keep that in mind 3 i am using these with a higher end router and i ve taken step to optimize my wifi signal throughout my home i would imagine you might have more issue if you re using these with a cheap or older router many lower end router just aren t designed to maintain constant connection to numerous device i think this is why many smart home manufacturer use an additional hub it eliminates putting so much on your router now to the product itself setup wa a breeze took just a couple of minute per outlet including a firmware update plugged in my lamp connected to my amazon echo and everything wa good to go been using them for about 3 week and they work on the first try every time so far like i said i m using these with echo the app work ok a a remote and is sometimes more convenient than the echo but i don t know if it would be worth it without the echo or other third party voice control hardware i do wish the bottom had a smaller footprint a some plug will not fit under the wemo switch i ll update this review if i encounter any problem,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
takes some patience but it will work after a few problem,4.0,ok i wa just getting ready to put this back in the box and return it to amazon wow this thing is not just plug and play a many people have noticed i wasn t sure if my router password wa the problem at first a it say number and letter only who ha a password like that nowadays that wasn t the only problem when i tried to set it up yesterday the wemo came up in the wireless network as i couldn t get it to work i became frustrated and sat it down overnight today didn t start out better a it still didn t show up in the wireless network but to the point delete and reload the wemo app then upgrade the firmware on the wemo say it take up to 10 minute but it didn t and voila the thing work like a champ,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
setup is a nightmare only work about 50 of the time,1.0,i regret this purchase so much bought it to turn on an a c unit wifi signal for everything else near the device is near 100 wemo can sometimes connect to the network sometimes not only way to fix it is to go through the setup process all over again which is a nightmare device usually turn itself off half way through the process good idea bad execution find another solution unless you really like being frustrated and going through the install process 10 time in a row just to get it working,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
overall it is a good investment for anyone who want to make a smart home,3.0,easy to set up fast respond time from both the app and well suing my echos or tap set up wa a bit tricky but after a few time it work i am giving it 3 star becouse it wa a bit tricking to set up and that i did have to redo the set up a few week after the first set up overall it is a good investment for anyone who want to make a smart home,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i love these thing,5.0,i have two outlet type for lamp plus one in the wall type controlling my porch light these are so much better than those mechanical clockwork timer that have the little plastic thing you pull out to set the on off time setup on these is a little odd and hard to understand at first but it work great and give you a lot of flexibility in setting on off program,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
would not recommend,1.0,bought tried to set it up on my home network using a motorola sbg6850 router an an iphone 6 running ios 9 0 2 wemo app would not find my main home network two extended phone call with belkin customer support failed to solve the problem as this wa my first smart device i wa really disappointed returned device to amozon will go to a wemo competitor that ha a better track record my compliment to amazon for their return procedure very simple and efficient,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
frustrating setup finally gave up and returned it,1.0,the simple setup wa so frustrating that i returned the wemo switch for a refund it refused to connect to my wifi network despite 4 hour of resetting restoring factory default and re trying tried all of the online remedy from belkin and other contributor product wifi must be inferior even when right next to the router apparently there are many people who experienced the same frustration,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

awesome,4.0,works a advertised i use it in conjunction with my echo it can be a pain to initially set up if you re not tech savvy since it may take a couple try to get it up and running but stay connected once it s set up also the device itself is bulky and stick out from the wall socket which could interfere with furniture lining up flush against wall all in all it s handy a hell and i m pleased,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works well then becomes a source of unending frustration,1.0,it wa neat for a little while when it worked then it stopped working and no amount of reset would revive it much too finicky to recommend to anyone definitely a failure when compared alongside our echo or hue bulb,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good product but not good for multiple location,3.0,the product itself seems like a good product but my issue is that i have two house 1 in the state and 1 mexico the product will only work in one location not multiple i first set it up in my house in the us worked great i then took more device to the mexico house and they wouldn t work they kept trying to link themselves to the wifi network to my house in the state and there didn t appear to be a way to change that the problem i m sure is not with the device itself it s a problem with their app note to belkin please fix the app for use in multiple location and wifi networks,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
easy christmas light with alexa,5.0,i bought this to use with the echo for my christmas tree the plug is behind the tree and inaccessible i plugged it in set it up through the free wemo app which took maybe 10 minute and told alexa to discover it it ha worked well and i have enjoyed speaking to turn the christmas tree light on and off instead of crawling all around the tree,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

nice idea if it worked,1.0,i saw in the review that setting the switch up with your wifi connection could be tricky but i figured that i could probably figure it out i bought it to use with 2 lamp while i wa going to be away they were problematic from the moment i plugged them in i could easily identify the switch on the belkin network but when it tried to connect to my own wifi it wa only intermittently successful i tried for 3 day the first night i spent 2 hour i tried belkin s faq and customer support and wa still unsuccessful the second day after a good night s sleep i thought i would try it again this time for no discernable reason it wa successful it seemed to be operating correctly but stated i needed a firmware update i downloaded the firmware update and then it could no longer find my wifi and i wa back to step 1 i tried the rest of the day and again the next day but could never get it to find my wifi again no matter what i did i ended up returning them to amazon,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

when the power go off you have to reset the dumb thing,1.0,came back home to a non functioning unit apparently power had been off prior to my arrival after research a learned they they don t do so well after power loss ain t nobody got time for that recommend looking at tp link instead cheaper and more reliable,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
buyer beware,1.0,i have purchased 3 of the smart plugs and they just flat fail in the reliability catagory they are not reliable they do work with alexa sometimes and sometimes they do not they are on the network sometimes and other time they just drop off i highly recommend that you do not purchase this item belkin need to pull them off the market until they have corrected the product and amazon should not sell this item until such time a belkin doe so btw i would not feel bad about sending all of them in for a refund i never ever write review but these are so frustrating that i must make this review,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
real time saver and convenient,5.0,i have two of these now one for my christmas tree light and one for an unswitched outlet that is difficult to get to now i can control those outlet from the convenience of my android phone or tablet one thing to note though is that the official belkin app for controlling these device is truly dreadful and i had a terrible time getting the app to connect to the device fortunately a third party developer mikep wrote an app called wemo manager that work much much better i think belkin spent too much time making their app look pretty and forgot that it first duty is to work wemo manager might not look so pretty but it reliably locates and control the device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
name it tell alexa to turn it on never look back,5.0,works wonderfully i use this a a light switch since it s cheaper than the wifi bulb and i named it castiel thinking it might be hard for it to recognize it work well i walk into my place and tell alexa amazon echo to turn on castiel and it turn on sometimes a slight delay but it turn on eventually cannot recommend it enough for easy use when sleeping and such,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

great for automated control,3.0,the good i use this along with ifttt to turn my light on and off automatically in response to text message when i am on vacation the wemo app is nice but you need the free ifttt app a well to get the full benefit of this switch the bad this device us pigtail instead of screw terminal this result in extra wire and extra wire nut which crowd the electrical box this switch would get 5 star if it came with screw terminal i would give it bonus point if it came with professional grade back wired screw clamp terminal,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
vast improvement on the outlet timer definitely make me want to look more into an integrated smart home,5.0,this is a vast improvement over the old mechanical and even some digital outlet timer its much easier to set schedule and can even be done remotely i plan to buy a few more of these to automate a few device in my home there is a novelty factor that make me want to buy some for thing i don t really need it on,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
this is an awesome way to voice control or wirelessly control almost any appliance works with echo,4.0,this switch is exactly what i needed however it is slightly larger than i would have hoped but that s ok it wirelessly control my appliance using my voice and amazon echo or the cell phone app i have it powering my projector right now pros very fast acting will activate within a second of asking amazon echo to turn on or off easy to set up cons requires an app to use and app must always be installed on your phone otherwise amazon echo will not recognize device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
pretty awesome,5.0,these work a stated i had to reset my router after a few failed attempt to connect but once i did that they connected instantly i usually hit the snooze button 12 time before getting out of bed so i ve used the schedule feature to turn on a lamp in my room every morning to help force myself out of bed it s been working great so far,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
worked for awhile,1.0,3 time taller than most adapter worked until i got a newer wi fi router now i can t get a signal from the wemo one time i did it wouldn t stay connected poor design physically and hardware takes up the upper outlet the lower outlet is barely accessible ended up buying another adapter brand,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
android users beware app is broken do not buy it will not work,1.0,android app is extremely buggy and disables ability to set rule what is the point of an alleged smart switch if it doe not work they claimed it wa android compatible sure a a dumb switch that you could get for 2 do not buy if you are an android user it doe not work and belkin apparently doe not care,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
perfect that s all i wanted in the first place,4.0,i bought the wemo switch and installed it to switch my tv soundbar on and off a a way to mute the tv with a voice command on my amazon echo when i first set it up it took two try just to get it on the network correctly i use an apple router for my wifi once set up it worked equally the same from either 1 iphone6 2 ipad mini or 3 amazon echo by equal i mean that once you got the wemo s attention it reliably turned the switch on and off from any device i ran it that way for a few hour if you didn t send a command to the wemo for 20 minute or so the wemo seemed to go into a sleep mode and it took several try to wake it up before it would finally accept a command again not ok i did the firmware update that it notified me wa available and now it doesn t go into sleep mode anymore whenever i command it turn tv on turn tv off it responds the first time from the echo perfect that s all i wanted in the first place on the downside now the iphone can t talk to it at all but the ipad can and it responds the first time every time on the ipad also i give it four star because it accomplished my mission to mute the tv from the echo buggy you bet either amazon or apple need to make something like this themselves,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
installed and configured within a few minute almost seamlessly,5.0,it doe exactly what it supposed to turn power on and off remotely my concern wa with setting it up and connecting it to the wifi network i returned a similar product raynic wireless switch because i could not reliably connect it this one connected easily after i realized that the mobile device on which wemo app is installed must be connected to the wemo wifi network not your home wifi there is no instruction booklet only a small quick setup card so it wasn t clear to me that i had to switch to nemo wifi if i could i would give this 4 5 star but if this is not an option 5 star it is i should note that i only connected it today so i can t offer an opinion on how this device is during a long term use i can only review installation and configuration,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great with echo dot,5.0,we purchased two switch to run bedroom light and a box fan through an echo dot the switch is easy to set up and use there have been a few instance where alexa is unable to access the switch but that is more the exception than the rule and i m not sure if the issue in those instance is alexa the switch or our network this is a great device and i would highly recommend it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
nice gadget to have but know there is an app you have to install that s ten more dollar before you buy,4.0,would have given it a five if i hadn t had to pay ten buck for the app to make it work good little gadget to use with amazon s alexa we use it daily,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo wall outlet work well,4.0,i previously purchased 2 wemo outlet a few year ago and needed to purchase two more i had the original switch installed on my smartphone the installation of the new switch took a few attempt but finally got them loaded to my phone however the first two switch got wiped out on my phone s wemo app the first two switch are at another house so i will need to re add them to the wemo app i also have them connected to an amazon echo dot unit so i can tell alexa to turn the light on and off i would recommend these switch a well a the wall switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
app crash and hang a lot never did get switch to work in 4 hour of trying,1.0,i am a programmer and an internet professional not a newbie two of u engineer tried for four hour to get it working without success factory reset the switch 5 or 6 time tried both ios and android apps tried every conceivable path apps crashed a lot hung repeatedly did not sync up name without rebooting the switch lot and lots of problem and in the end although the switch appeared to connect to the cloud successfully it never did work had deviceid null and never wa able to do the one thing it supposedly doe turn the outlet on or off i sent a detailed problem report to the belkin support team with the app and have not heard back from them 24 hour later my setup is a straightforward comcast internet connection with nothing out of the ordinary plugged in the switch and followed all the instruction very frustrating,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
look ma no hands,5.0,this addition to my home is awesome i just walk into one of the room and are able to turn the light off or on with a simple voice command i am very surprised on how simple it wa to set up to connect to my home wifi if i am out of town or away from home i can turn my light on or off with my phone or i can set the timer with my phone a well the wemo timer is a lot simpler to configure than the traditional timer,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo switch with amazon echo not for the switch alone,5.0,as the title indicates this review and rating apply only to the combination of an echo and a wemo switch personally i would not recommend the wemo switch by itself i got my first switch a a gift and i frankly thought it wa a poor product concept after all what kind of poor schmuck is too lazy to turn off a light switch um er i guess that would be me it s worth noting that roughly 6 year ago i had zero interest in ever buying a kindle a i didn t think it could ever stack up against the experience of reading a well made hard cover after trying the kindle once i now rarely buy physical book except professional text first let me explain my set up i have an echo resting on my admittedly 1970 s style bookcase headboard in my bedroom and a lamp on top of a bureau across the room i usually end my day listening to music on the echo while reading a book on my kindle or watching a television episode on my ipad using the echo a a substitute speaker for the lousy built in having received what i thought wa a silly gift i would never use i left it in the box for a couple of week before getting off my butt and hooking it up to the lamp after setting up the switch and connecting it to the echo more on setup issue below i simply said alexa please turn off the lamp and the lamp turned off let me preface this with the statement that i used to think i wa a fairly bright person however the next 5 minute after completing the setup convinced me that my inner child is a total idiot finding yourself repeatedly saying alexa please turn off the lamp alexa please turn on the lamp while giggling is not a strong vote for one possessing a mature mind i have found one use for this silly thing that i truly enjoy as i get drowsy reading a book rather than get out a warm comfy bed to turn thing off i simply whisper alexa please turn off the lamp instant darkness and silence without having to wake yourself back up by trudging across the room for the second one in the living room man cave i can turn activate it using a normal conversational voice volume from 25 or circa 7 5m away the major downside is that the setup via the ios app is buggy the direction grossly insufficient and the user interface provides false negative throughout the set up process by false negative i mean that the app indicates that your set up is failing when in fact it ha succeeded the trick is simple switch back and forth between the wemo app and the ios setting app and it suddenly show up a being fully connected to sync to the echo you must first press the tiny button on top of the unit and then say alexa detect my wemo switch and you are done i would give the app by itself 1 star on the safety side of thing even though it s rated for 1800w i would question the wisdom of ever going over 500 watt a single light or two is fine but space heater or high end entertainment system not for this product i think wemo wa kindly stated aggressive in their specing this at 1800w this opinion is based on simple prejudice regarding lightweight electronics and is not the result of any benchmarking or other testing i reserve the right to be completely wrong the only other downside is that your friend will react by saying thing like don t you have anything better to do with your money the more straight forward you are an idiot and the occasional i m not sure if that is awesome or just plain creepy my recommended response is to grin and send them one a a gift but only if they already own an echo i hope you find this review to be helpful i ll update this post if the unit fail,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
automate your home electronics,5.0,i use the wemo to have light in my apartment go on a few minute before my alarm go off in the morning and shut off after i leave making one le thing to think about in the morning which is priceless with some creative rulemaking you can really put your home lighting scheme on autopilot i use only led light so electricity waste and heat generated are minimal super easy set up i found there are occasional headache with it losing the internet connection requiring a re pairing with the router or a restart of the iphone app i chalk this up to weakness of my home internet and not the wemo switch great first gen product i look forward to seeing other home automation product from belkin,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
junk,1.0,i bought two of these neither of them worked out of the box the app is buggy and timed out when trying to join my wifi network changing router didn t help trying to reset them with the reset button left one not broadcasting a wifi network at all and the other one broadcasting a network that could not be joined at no point could i get these to join my network or perform the very basic function of turning a light on or off this is just a poorly designed product and a total waste of time save yourself the trouble and frustration,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
connecting lamp and appliance to my echo dots with these plug a snap,5.0,i used these plug to add my arrangement of living room lamp to an alexa control group so i could simply say alexa living room on and have all the light turn on without walking to each lamp manually and switching them on they configured easily with the instruction provided and work beautifully with my network of echo dots,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works well but,3.0,works well with a few flaw the setup can be confusing since the instruction are a bit thin on detail i m also having problem with the internal clock not being accurate so the start stop time drift slightly each day to an earlier time i would instead recommend a system where there is a central controller to ensure command are given properly and time is accurately kept also best to use a system that follows the z wave standard,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
its very sad that a company like belkin cannot get right and blame user when it appears it is their hardware,1.0,it appeared when i purchased these unit that wemo had solved their issue with switch disappearing from the network and faulty ios software but after only 8 month none of my switch will recognize the network and all of the rule stopped working with light staying on 24 7 its very sad that a company like belkin cannot get right and release product that are so buggy i am now having to work with tech support and get replacement fail update i finally received warranty replacement hardware after 3 month of trying to prove that the unit were dud an again the replacement unit are very inconsistent other device that are much farther away from router have no connection problem,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

so far so good wemo smart plug wall outlet switch,5.0,this review is for the wemo switch smart plug not for any of the other wemo product also lumped together in review here based on the blanket of poor rating i avoided this unit at first in my search for a smart plug and instead went with the xenon brand and while i loved that one and it worked great it stopped working after a few day see my review if curious about what happened the seller did promise to replace it but while waiting i did a bit more looking around and discovered that this wemo is actually a belkin product though sold under their wemo branding and because i ve never had anything but pretty good experience with belkin and it wa on sale here i though i d give it a try despite the sad rating my need for a smart plug is to control space heater remotely now that it is winter my apartment a well a my office get mighty cold my option to date ha either been to arrive at home or work in a freezing environment or waste money leaving heater on when i m not around which get very expensive when i m gone at work for 12 or 14 hour and i am heating an empty apartment ideally what i need to do is be able to just turn the heat on a few hour before i get to work or a few hour before i get home and it seemed this smart plug invention wa the way to solve it since my office heat up faster than my apartment and i hate coming home to an igloo much more than arriving at a cold office i figured i d try this one at home first to replace the xenon unit that had failed after a few day of use set up wa incredibly easy connected right up to my wifi and instruction were simple to decipher i tested it a few time throughout the first day and no issue with connectivity and no issue controlling my heater at home did some remote testing a well and every time it wa perfect when the app say it wa on it wa on when it said it wa off it wa off i wa able to trigger it both on any wifi network a well a on my 4g lte service at this point then i have had the best experience no problem whatsoever i ll update if anything go wrong or stop working after all the xenon unit also earned 5 star at first until it quit on me if this wemo keep up the great performance i may not bother trying out the replacement xenon if or when i actually receive it and will very likely just buy a second one of these for my office heater although i m not sure how it work to have two smart plug on two different network controlled by the same app not sure if that s something i can even do but hopefully if not i have a second wifi device my cell phone from last year that i can use to control the work one if it come to that i ll update a i said if anything go awry but for me this one is easily five star and i m not sure what is going on with all of the awful review for this and wow there are a lot of bad experience reported here but maybe like the xenon there are quality control issue happening and i just got lucky and received a good one i don t know i think part of the issue maybe is that all of the wemo product here are lumped together in the review which is unfortunate because the 8 product listed should really each have their own review section so someone can see feedback for a specific wemo product not just all feedback put together for all 8 of the wemo item listed in any case i hope this is helpful for those looking at the smart plug wall switch it s working great for me and i easily recommend it based on my experience so far thanks for reading,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

let me save you a lot of trouble,1.0,what a total waste of time and money do not purchase wemo product if you have an apple router after my experience i d be hesitant to purchase them at all no matter what kind of router i had we have an apple wireless router and apple device if you look on troubleshooting website you ll see that wemo device do not work well with apple wireless which i now know thanks to hour of completely wasted time and increasing aggravation however since this glitch is never discussed in the product description or in any documentation produced by wemo or belkin i purchased this product in good faith and spent hours yesterday trying to get it to work including rebooting and reinstalling several time reconfiguring my wireless platform etc etc wemo troubleshooting guide are poorly organized and contain conflicting or incomplete information totally maddening i tried for live chat but there wa never a customer service representative available i finally picked up the phone and got a customer service rep fairly quickly which wa good except that she wa unable to spell my first name or last name or get my address correct after several try she wa based in the united states no language barrier just incompetence she wa nice but completely incapable of offering assistance ha she ever used a wemo device i wonder completely frustrating experience if after this experience i thought wemo had good product support i might consider switching to a belkin router my own conclusion however since belkin never actually say that this would be helpful and instead let potential customer twist in the wind however given the abysmal troubleshooting documentation and unqualified technical support i will not take the risk of screwing up my entire home network for the convenience of remote control of a few light switch and coffee pot oh and by the way be careful of the promise that the switch will help you turn on coffee remotely the first feature listed under the switch i can t say for sure because i could never get my switch to work but if your coffee maker doesn t have a switch that will set permanently to on not a button or a spring lever then the wemo switch won t work to turn on your coffee maker perhaps this should be obvious but then again perhaps wemo should engage in a little more honest marketing for it product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

overall i m satisfied the only real limitation is with the lamp,4.0,i purchased three of these in a recent sale to automate the turning on off of three lamp in my living and dining room overall i m satisfied the only real limitation is with the lamp and the fact that you need to have them in a permanent on state for the switch to be used properly turning any one of the lamp off manually at the pull chain will mean that the switch is no longer able to turn the lamp on installation installation wa simple download wemo smart phone application plug in switch connect phone to wemo device configure to use your house s wifi you can also rename the device to make it easily identifiable afterwards i wa asked to update the device via the remote a couple of time which all went smoothly make sure you don t unplug your device after hitting the button to allow the update to happen you could potentially cause problem with your device rules setting up rule wa extremely straightforward i went in to the wemo application and chose which device i wanted on off and the time for them integration with amazon echo in the amazon echo smartphone application it wa able to immediately detect the three new switch i wa able to add them to a named group that allows me to turn them all on and off with a simple alexa turn the lamp on or alexa turn the lamp off integration with ifttt i wa also able to configure these switch to work with the ifttt service i created a do button on my phone that would toggle all of these switch at once as an added bonus the do button wa also available on my moto 360 smartwatch which mean i can toggle the lamp on and off from my wrist when i m leaving the house or coming home the one downside to using ifttt is that they can only toggle from on to off and vice versa and not explicitly turn off or on,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

completely useless after the last firmware upgrade,1.0,these worked great when i first got two of them then the genius at belkin decided to release firmware that wasn t properly tested both of my device would lose connection 5 to 6 time a day i contacted belkin about my issue and their support is even more useless than these device are now they told me to restart your handset close the application disconnect the wemo device from the power source for about 20 30 second then plug it back in re open the application and try again restart your router delete the application from your phone then re install it they wanted me to do this each time they lost connection the last thing they told me wa to reset the device to the factory default setting which i did since the other solution were moronic so after resetting them to factory setting now mind you firmware is burned in so i only reset it s setting the new programming remained flawed they now will not connect to the wifi network so essentially they are junk thanks belkin for nothing,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

great idea terrible execution,1.0,belkin i know the trend is to kick hardware product out the door soon a possible with the idea that a subsequent software update will fix everything later but really stop at least bother to test it once i ve worked in app engineering for over a decade and this is the most ill conceived and thoroughly untested gadget i ve encountered in that time for the price you re asking you ve got to be joking only the joke really isn t funny at any price the ux design on the app is non existent you cannot setup multiple rule the workflow leaf me feeling like a lab rat and there actually is no cheese in the maze who wants a switch that only turns on and stays on this is thick you need to give your engineering and marketing staff fat severance package so they ll let your leadership know before you further damage your brand with junk like this,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

started working better after resetting better product on the market than this,2.0,i wa hoping to use this switch to automatically turn my light on in the morning it worked great for a week but it no longer turn on automatically with the other light assigned to the same rule obviously the rule is working because the light switch are turning on off but both of the outlet switch are doing the same thing by not responding to rule or voice command using echo if you look at the app it constantly say the outlet switch is unavailable which is connectivity issue not sure if it s actually a hardware problem or if this can be fixed via firmware hopefully the latter but the several comment i ve sent to customer service over the last few day are being ignored so it doe not appear they intend to be responsive to this situation i will update my review a thing change but i m probably sending one of the two switch i have back a it is obviously a defective product in it current state update 5 31 2016 decided to keep the switch since they did respond and were willing to help i did regain more reliable connectivity after resetting the device but i m no longer using it for my light because the wink hub and it product seem to work much better i ve been using ge link bulbs and a ge z wave switch which are far better than the wemo product admittedly i have not tried the new wemo light bulb however the wink hub can interact with so many product that it make home automation more practical wemo ha extremely basic automation functionality all that said i m giving them another star for the time being because it is working a little better than before update 8 25 2017 wemo work fine these day but the product are overpriced and i am still completely satisfied with the wink system in way wemo can t even perform my entire house now ha automated lighting with echo controlling them via voice command and my 2 wemo switch and 1 still working of 2 originally purchased outlet are the weak link in my setup if my nest protect alarm sound for any reason all my light except for the wemo s will turn on my mood light setting voice command will control everything except for the wemo s so after writing this review i realize that not only do i need to replace the switch cuz seriously out of my entire house it s only 2 more but i also have to lower my rating back down to a 2 star,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
so much better than a non smart timer plug,5.0,great for turning lamp on and off in the house based on sunrise and sunset rather than a specific time,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
meh,3.0,purchased this because i wanted to be able to remotely power cycle my home server while away unfortunately these wemo switch seem to every once in awhile shut off and take down whatever device wa connected to it opening the app or pressing the button on the switch is enough to bring the device back up but since the intent wa to minimize the amount of downtime this device failed it s main objective by adding new problem into the mix i replaced my previous model and have a second on another computer a well all 3 have done it at random interval not enough for it to be a huge problem but enough for it to be a major annoyance i also didn t like how the mobile remote setup is done i want to open up a port in my router forward it to the device and have a web page with login that i can access when away instead i have to launch the app while on the same wifi network and hope that the setup is robust enough to survive any potential network ip change while i m away their method is significantly easier to initially set up but i want flexibility if you just have a simple use case i want to turn this lamp on while i m away then this work the programming is good enough for a lamp timer but my setting somehow got erased after an update and if you don t care about remote on off then a simple dump 5 timer will do the job just a well ended up just buying a real web power switch to do an even better job at what i want,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

my least reliable smart device,2.0,if you re planning to use the wemo smart plug with the samsung smartthings hub think twice mine ha been a source of endless problem especially when compared with z wave alternative let s start with the basic this plug is enormous and ugly it if you install it in the top socket of a duplex receptacle it doesn t quite block the lower socket but you ll need a relatively slim cord to be able to use it the device ha a prominent lighted on off switch which is good since you ll need to use it frequently the device requires a connection to your wifi network so setup is a little more involved than with a z wave switch controlling the wemo smart plug via the wemo iphone app frequently work but doesn t allow any sort of automation you press the software button and the light turn on press it again and the light turn off occasionally you ll have to tap the software button multiple time to get the switch to activate connecting the wemo smart plug to your smartthings hub is comparatively easy once you ve connected it to your wifi network keeping it online and usable by smartthings is where the problem start all of my smartthings connected device are eminently reliable except the wemo smart plug every couple of day it will show up a being offline for no apparent reason and the only way to make it work again is to physically unplug it from the wall then plug it in again so that it reboots usually that s all that s necessary to get the wemo working again but the disconnect happen frequently enough that you simply can t rely on this switch to work i ve had one or two occasion where a simple reboot didn t work and i ended up having to delete the switch from smartthings repair it and then update all of the smartapps and routines that used it if you need a reliable smart plug i would recommend using the ge lighting duplex receptacle for in wall installation or a z wave controlled smart plug like the samsung smartthings outlet ge lighting appliance module or ge lighting lamp module with dimmer control all of these are far more reliable than the wemo smart plug in my experience,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

one star,1.0,these work well for low power item like a lamp or a lamp but absolutely do not use on anything that is mid to high wattage like a heater or laptop desktop computer a the wemo will melt your power cord and burn the wemo unit once the wemo get burnt it is really no longer safe to use and also break the wifi functionality they claim it can handle up to 1800 watt but i believe they must be measuring in peak and not rms because i have had two of these burn and melt fusing the power cord permanently to the wemo i don t know why there is no thermal safety sensor thermal breaker or even software update that could calculate watt usage over time and have adjustable safty shut off prior to melting and causing electrical fire i guess a few dozen house or apartment complex have to burn down first before belkin update this serious design flaw i would recommend not to us these on any item that require sustained level of power greater than that of a 60 incandescent bulb serious fire hazard,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

buggy software make this unreliable and potentially unsafe,1.0,i purchased this product to control an espresso machine hoping it would preheat the machine before i woke up in the morning i have had a very mixed experience with this product and all of it seems to boil down to bug in the wemo software my quick summary is that the product is good but that the recurring software problem left me with the opinion that this isn t just a bad product it can also become an unsafe product depending on what you are controlling with that outlet wemo illustrates an iron being controlled by this outlet imagine what could happen if that came on at the wrong time it is just too unreliable in the 10 month i have owned this product the one recurring theme ha been that at various time the outlet ha turned on when it wasn t supposed to according to the rule i have set two of the three period where i saw this happen were the week after the clock changed for daylight savings time when i first got the product thing were off by one hour so i adjusted my rule to match that error then one day they corrected something and the rule started running on time when daylight savings time began i had to reset everything to get it working right the outlet would turn on at the wrong time most recently following the end of daylight savings time the outlet is coming on at 7pm instead of 8am so it isn t just a matter of them losing track of one hour once the setup go into this mode the only solution is to start over with the configuration they have again directed me to reinstall my entire setup mobile software resetting the outlet device and re entering the rule it is consuming more time than it is worth a simple mechanical timer would be more reliable than this thing i think if you have the patience to fiddle with their software and endure through the problem when they arise then maybe wemo is for you i ve had my fill of it at this point,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

app make this switch a pain to deal with,2.0,the plug itself might be okay and when it is paired it doe work well but the number of problem with it meant i had to return it 1 pairing is extremely painful and unreliable for starter the app for some reason kept looking for the plug on my cellular 3g connection obviously not finding any plug there instead of the wemo switch own wi fi network which i wa connected to after i turned off cellular data on my phone it finally decided to use the wemo switch wi fi and discovered the switch the entire process wa punctuated every few second by the app just hanging during discovery or wi fi connection 2 i had two of these switch and one of the switch wa just never discovered at all or paired 3 the switch that did pair kept losing it connection every few day making the home automation unreliable i think all of these problem really stem from a poorly written android app which definitely hang if you have to go to another app in the middle of the process and switched back to it but even if you stay on the app it will eventually hang when working the switch work beautifully the away mode is nicely done and the switch is operable remotely but the setup and constant disconnect meant i had to give this up i researched some more and ended up buying the tp link smart plug wi fi works with alexa which while having some problem of it own paired without problem and work very nicely,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

can t add already set up device when remote make this product worthless,1.0,i really wanted to like this product i keep a slingbox set up attached to a cable box at my parent s house a i tend to travel around a bit and don t want to pay for another tv service at my own apartment since my slingbox is rather old it tends to lock up at time and require a power cycle to get back in a working state so i bought this a it wa cheaper than most other network control power switch on the market and seemed pretty simple to set up and use it worked great exactly a i wa hoping for the first month or so it wa pretty simple to set up and worked flawlessly whenever i needed to use it however after a month or two of use it suddenly stopped working trying to do anything in the wemo app didn t respond so i wa sol regarding trying to use my device eventually when i got back to my parent house even on the local network the device wouldn t work i ended up having to do a manual factory reset of the device in order to get it back and usable after the factory reset it worked fine however my biggest complaint is the wemo app s lack of having any form of account management i m currently nowhere near my parent house and my phone died so i had to get a new one with my new phone when i installed the wemo app there no way for me to recover my old list of device the only thing the app let me do is add new device connected to my local network however since i m nowhere near my wemo switch that is impossible and so i m once again without access to controlling my device if they added the ability to recover our device remotely this review would instantly go back to a 4 star review for a device that s intended purpose it to allow you to control it from anywhere in the world not having a way of re setting up access to it when remote is a huge flaw in their design tldr device work well enough however the lack of ability to setup add your wemo switch on a new device unless you re physically at the device is a huge design flaw that keep this device from being useful,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

stopped working,2.0,1 month later it would no longer connect to my wifi tried resetting and it just doesnt work anymore dont waste your money update this device work ok however the app that come with it is not very user friendly unfortunately this device is nothing more than a glorified wifi switch without a good app to go with it i have figured out after hour of trial and error that you need to disable remote setting and all that nonsense from all your device that use it not an easy task if you set it up with multiple device there should be a master reset option instead of these thing i tried using the help on the app without getting any either i have tried this both on an iphone and an android phone they are equally difficult to manage and maintain sometimes the remote access feature doe not work for me at all so i would have to be in the wifi network to use it i think a lot of improvement is needed for this device to be useful at all i m leaving this with a 1 star review because all it s done so far is annoy me with multiple unintelligent setting and terrible re setup update 2016 other than a 5ghz wifi band incompatibility after it is set up it work very well with amazon echo i am bumping this up to 2 star because the app still isn t good with it but is functional and very convenient with echo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

this product is laughably bad,1.0,what a great idea what poor poor execution these bad boy went on sale so i picked up three right off the bat it took me about 2 hour to set up the 3 the android app struggled with connecting to the actual product to the wifi and really just about everything once i finally got them up and running i find that for some reason when i m within my network i cannot see the name i set for my wemo s in fact i can t do anything but turn them off and on from within my network i try to contact support and they tell me i should try some generic reset everything technique that sounded like a canned response so i download the older beta app and finally i can see what i m actually turning on and turning off funny that an app that is about 6 month older work better than the new one right well today they just stop working so now i have no choice but to try reset them this is where it get bad it take 10 to 20 try just to use the physical button on the device to reset them tie that in with the usual unable to actually set up anything correctly app and i m 4 hour in and only one is actually setup one i would not recommend this product to anyone not in it s current form i think the android app is most to blame the app unbelievably deficient slow and just doesn t work most the time i would return these if i wasn t so head hard and intent on making them work for me but please whatever you do save yourself the pain,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

when a product fails at it primary purpose it is useless,1.0,look for a different switch these are terrible i bought three of them i started with two the set up wa not a easy a it should be one of them took five try to get it set up the app is awful it is confusing and difficult to figure out how to assign share and configure rule i consider myself to be more than moderately tech savvy if you are not that then i would imagine setting this up and working the app would be near impossible ok so i get the first two set up and they are working fairly well at first so i buy a third one with the experience of setting the first two up this one wa slightly le difficult to set up but still not a easy a it should be almost immediately the third one would go on and off randomly during it scheduled time to be on maybe resetting it and starting over may have solved this but the set up is so painful on these that i never did it i guess they recently did an update of the firmware on these and after that now none of the light turn poff they turn on when scheduled but they do not shut off so i took the irritating frustrating and painful time to reset all three of the switch guess what they still do not turn off i awoke the next morning to all three light being on i am not sure if the resetting ha or ha not fixed the random on off of the third one a i really didn t pay attention and i just did this all yesterday i think the worst part of this is the seeming indifference of wemo to even acknowledge this a quick check online show that this is a common issue with wemo owner all over for sometime some people who have contacted wemo state that wemo give them some form of it is not u it is you response i will give it this it doe interact with the echo well and i do enjoy that aspect but that is a secondary reason i bought these certainly a reason but the main reason i have these is to turn light on and off if they do not do that reliably then i consider them useless the sad thing is well it should be sad for wemo that i wa just getting ready to buy 2 or 3 more of these again i am a fairly competent person with tech stuff i can set up almost anything even more complicated household installation so i can say with certainty it is not me it is them i will be looking for a different brand do not buy wemo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works but not sure if my phone s wifi connection is le secure now because of the wemo,4.0,i m no tech wizard so please don t hold my ignorance against me i wa unsure if this wa going to work for my room based on some of the online review but overall i m glad i bought this because it did exactly what i needed it to do which wa create a remote controlled light i had a plug located in an inconvenient location and it made it difficult to use the light switch on the wall to turn the light on and off in my room thanks to the wemo i only had to worry about plugging in my lamp once and i never had to touch the light switch on the wall again one thing that i m not really comfortable with is that the wemo set up required that i route the wifi connection of my smartphone through the wemo app software versus connecting my phone directly to my home wifi like it used to be before the wemo now when i use my phone at home to browse the web i get constant error message stating that my phone is not connected to the internet maybe i made a mistake during set up but it s really annoying and somewhat unsettling to think my connection may be compromised,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

belkin wemo switch good for target practice only,1.0,of the almost 40 iot and home automation device sensor hub and platform that i have used tested and integrated into my home the wemo switch wa alway s the first to fail quite possibly the worst home automation product i have ever owned consistent at one thing going offline and you can be guaranteed that when you do a firmware update you ll have to reset the device any schedule you had and any integration with product like smartthings since it is wifi based only and ha no real local functional reliability it need cloud integration to automate with other non belkin sensor it will consistently fail when you have daylight saving s transition firmware upgrade power outage or any internet home networking interruption one would expect some level of redundancy so that during any of those event it could revert to last known setting or through battery backup non volatile memory etc provide a little redundancy but it doesn t it is good however for target practice,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
still not ready for prime time,1.0,worked with this for 3 hour to get it to connect to my wireless network not only would it not connect to any of my network it would not reset both via the app and via the physical reset switch the app will connect to the built in wemo network and then just spin trying to connect to the plug it just refuse to pair with anything i purchased this for use with echo but unfortunately i ll never see if it work returned,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

not a fan,2.0,i love the ability to turn on my light when i am not home a well a program the timer in a much way than the old fashion timer so when i saw the wemo switch i wa excited to try it sad to say we hated this switch and here s why it can only be controlled by one device because my husband set this up on his phone which he said set up wa pretty easy i wa unable to control it on mine i always had to use his phone when i wanted to do anything with it it functioned fine for a bit and then randomly the light started turning on and off every 10 minute by themselves annoying the first point wa just annoying the second point is why we chose to return this item and go with the etekcity wifi timer,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

alexa wanted nothing to do with this thing,1.0,this thing is absolute junk wemo switch probably all of these also backwards engineering ridiculous idea on how ifttt should bend around them plus alexa hate it as in the echo didn t find it didn t want to find it and preferred to not integrate and have it circuitry mixed up touched synchronized or associated with this thing please don t think i m just here to bash this item a i m not in fact i can t remember the last time i wrote a review but this thing pi ed me off so much i thought i d possibly save someone else the headache the setup process is beyond logic a in you have to download their app install it on your phone using wifi then disconnect use their network being broadcast from the switch to get it registered to the app then switch back to wifi and complete the process i wa able to get the switch to turn on and off from the app but not with alexa which wa the main reason for getting this nor wa i able to use it from my phone using the cellular network and yes i had a signal and wa able to use other apps only on wifi the thing also seemed a bit warm for my taste and it took up too much of the plug to be able to effectively use the other outlet look i wanted to like this and i wanted to use it but it just doesn t do or live up to anything close to what it say it can or eludes to being able to do without sounding conceited i am pretty competent when it come to electronics and technology so i knew what i wa doing but this thing is just a joke and i guess i should ve known better than to trust belkin a i have never thought too much of their product before and even le now researching through the so called help they have posted and listed throughout the internet just show the lack of support or care because i obviously wasn t the first person to have any of these problem i already requested a return and will be shipping it back tomorrow i can get my money back but not the time i wasted on this don t do what i did look for something else which is what i will be doing mike,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

not ready for release,1.0,to begin with the wemo switch isn t a sufficiently robust player in the wifi world plugged into an outlet in a room with a strong network signal according to four cell phone two laptop and a signal strength meter the wemo continually faded in and out of availability a if faraday s ghost were wandering between me and the switch if i have to spend a couple of minute rediscovering switch every time i run the wemo app i might just a well use the time to walk into the room where the light is and that s after the mandatory you re asked if you want it but it doesn t matter what you pick software upgrade which take so long i expected to see the code delivered by a telegram messenger on my front porch but even if the hardware were reliable the wemo app for android wa shipped before it wa finished not just before qa mind you which would have put on brake had it happened at all but before the design wa done the ux designer wa evidently my next door neighbor s feeble minded golden retriever edit the device name go ahead but by the way you ll always see the factory default so change it a often a you like specify a programmed on time have at it we assume you ll never want to turn it off isn t that right turn on at dusk fine but we ll define dusk not by light but by a forecast for your city provided that you live in a place of our choice state capital and populous city omitted at random have a map handy fun idea but this product is not ready to ship i take that back about the dog dogs are color blind so the ui might have been more accessible if actually canine designed,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

great product on paper that doesn t work in reality,1.0,on paper this is 1 of the best smart switch i especially liked the integration with alexa and ifttt but unfortunately this is a seriously flawed product because of it unreliability i got this switch to work the first time successfully then tried to move it and it never worked again even after half a dozen reset technical support wa unable to resolve the issue and in the end wanted me to make all kind of change to my network that shouldn t have anything to do with the connectivity problem changing the channel of the 2 4ghz band that my router were transmitting on and disabling the security my suspicion is that they hacked this product together by a team unrelated to the router team or it wa through an acquisition how else can you explain a renowned wi fi router producer that can t produce a reliable easy to use connected smart switch even when it worked the first time it took way too long to connect the phone to the switch and then set it up inside the wi fi network all sign of bad product development in short believe the 1 star review this time and don t snooker yourself buying half a dozen of these and be stuck with brick after a few month i m switching to tp link even though they don t have ifttt integration yet,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

literally worse than useless,1.0,i should have listened to the other reviewer fortunately i can return it it took some doing to get this set up you need to connect the phone to the wemo s own wifi network and from there you enter your home wifi info problem is that my phone galaxy s3 always scan for the best network so after a minute or so it would revert to my home network i found a work around for that and got it to work feeling slightly smug with this small victory i headed out for some errand i glanced at my phone and noticed the 4g symbol wasn t there nor wa the 3g after lot of reset and experimentation i realized that for some reason the wemo software is preventing my phone from connecting to the data network i took the software off and the 4g came back i really wanted the wemo switch to work so i reinstalled the software to give it a second chance same result i m printing up my return label now,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

they seem to only work properly for a short amount of time before being borderline useless i purchased two of these outlet swit,1.0,i have always had problem with belkin product they seem to only work properly for a short amount of time before being borderline useless i purchased two of these outlet switch with the intention of being able to control the connected device my computer monitor via either the amazon echo or my smartthings hub for a time it work great with no issue but then either a firmware update will come out or it just will not be detected by echo or st anymore i will add that anytime i pull up the app the switch always show up and can be controlled manually just fine for me though the whole point of getting all these smart home device wa so i would not need to be tethered to my phone or tablet to control them if you re one of those people that can t walk 2 foot anywhere without your phone in your hand i suppose this will not be an issue if you re ok with not having st connectivity get the tp link switch instead installation wa a breeze by comparison and my echo discovered it right away i believe the tp link doe not have the correct frequency to connect to st but if the alternative is a switch that only work some of the time it s relatively the same thing to me don t support poor hardware and cumbersome software,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

very unreliable avoid at all cost,1.0,i really liked the idea of this switch and bought two of them in december one of them would only work when in the same room a the router orange flashing light with anything more than 10 foot from the router i returned this one the second had a better range and worked in a room about 40 foot from the router the set up wa ok but it required a software update on the switch i went away and set up a schedule for the switch for about a week everything worked perfectly after a week it stopped working and i get a flashing orange light in the mean time my wife threw away the packaging and so i wa forced to call belkin to try to arrange for a replacement i have just spent about 40 minute on the phone resetting the switch and trying to get it to work after this first call they would not let me return it but have authorized a higher level support person to call me within 48 hour to try some other thing painful painful they seem to be having a real qc problem with this switch i still like the idea of the switch and i like their software but i would not buy this until you start to see a consistent set of good review,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

this ha got to be the worst functioning piece of crap i have ever set eye,1.0,this ha got to be the worst functioning piece of crap i have ever set eye on there wa a time when belkin actually made quality product so this is extremely disappointing the switch will manually cut on and off just fine but the purpose of a wifi switch is to be able to control it remotely which it fails miserably it will not connect to the network the app will not find the device and amazon need to be reamed for even considering suggesting this a a product compatible for the echo if the app can t find it echo can t either do not waste your time or money on this product and the supporting unbelievably poor app find another manufacturer with a comparable product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
price point app easy setup,5.0,great price and product compared to the other brand purchased two of these after comparing and reviewing other style and brand this one doesn t need a hub just your home wifi and an iphone or android i use 3 of these for different light and lamp without interruption can even use these from outside the home and off the wifi great price didn t really need to get the other insight model and saved a few buck,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great but steep learning curve,4.0,this unit took a loot of time to get used to programming eventually i got the hang of it and the 2 unit i have are working fine one doe a light the other a battery charger that come on for one afternoon a week i once tried to check the status from my android phone away from home and not on local wifi totally screwed the programming so i will not do that again that is why i rate the unit 4 star,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great wish it wa smaller way too big for what it is,4.0,this is not my first foray into wemo product so i wa familiar with the quick and easy setup i do prefer the insight switch over this smart plug primarily because this wemo switch feel like there is a lot of wasted plastic the wemo insight switch while more expensive ha a much smaller and more aesthetically pleasing footprint setup is easy a long a your device find your wireless network that seems to be the biggest struggle and it took a while for it to find the network i wish there wa a better way to set these up let me access the switch to select which network and put in a key instead of having to depend on the device just finding the right network there is not enough feedback on how the setup network connection is going in my opinion i love the option the wemo app give you turn on at sunset off at a pre defined time it s great the alexa enabled voice control is also excellent and ha simplified a lot of thing in our house i also have a wemo insight switch and a tp link smart switch the tp link and this are very similar but the tp link is cheaper i use both and both are alexa enabled so both are a good step toward a smart home environment,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

nice product,5.0,works perfect easy to setup and access remotely,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
oh if only this thing worked 24 7,3.0,if only this thing were more reliable one definite flaw is that if it is used anywhere where you have two overlapping signal on different channel from say your wifi router an a second wifi access point it will frequently refuse to connect to the stronger one and instead lock on the distant and practically useless distant signal,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

incompatible with airplay,1.0,we bought three wemo insight switch and one wall switch because they seemed like a good idea the problem is whenever we launch the wemo app it shuts off our apple airplay music system which is very frustrating if you do not use airplay these device might work for you but because ours are not compatible with airplay we can t use them,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
its useless,2.0,if you enjoy the product you ll eventually get bored of it and ask yourself whether it it really worth the 50 good god it wa hard to update to firmware of the unit and it took forever i would have been smart if belkin installed a little usb port to hook it up to ur pc n set it up for there the unit requires that your house if covered with high strength wifi network and good luck trying to plug anything in the underneath socket its just too big it will eat up half of your cable extension port,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
dangerous do not use to check if a device is left on,1.0,do not use on important items their example above of never worrying you left a device on like an iron i used this on a space heater in my garage and it frequently say the switch is off when it is on this is very dangerous,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

goes well with the echo,5.0,i ordered these to go with the echo it will be a while before i actually get to try them because they are a gift but i did my homework and these should be exactly what i need update they are exactly what i need but they are a little finicky and not 100 reliable they have improved with firmware update somewhat,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

insecure cloud based garbage do not buy,1.0,the wemo is a good idea with poor implementation there is zero security built into the product and it is trivially exploitable on several front additionally the wemo app for your phone requires an insane number of completely unnecessary permission that lead me to believe belkin is creating a secondary revenue stream by data raping your device and contact for sale on the secondary market go with another device this one is garbage,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
junk,1.0,biggest piece of junk i ve bought in a long time bought to work with echo won t tried to use with phone doesn t don t waste your money i bought 4 and am sending them all back i d give them a 5 star if i could and guess what when i sent them back to amazon they sent me 4 more so i bought another phone and tried to set one of these up i got the exact same result don t buy these piece of junk save yourself a lot of aggravation,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

buy insight switch instead,1.0,had nothing but trouble with this switch keeping it connected to the wifi in my house i would return it but i threw away the packaging finally i replaced this with the wemo insight switch to control my christmas tree light the insight switch work great no problem this is not worth buying spent the extra s on the insight switch i believe belkin ha discontinued this switch if not they should not recommended,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
excellent,4.0,this wifi switch is and excellent product and easy to use i m usually slow to intall stuff but this took me like 5 min from opening the box to working i use it for my home security camera only reason not 5 star is price this wemo switch actually cost more than my security camera,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo echo love it,4.0,i got this to go with an amazon echo and it couldn t be cooler all i have to do is say alexa turn on the light and on they go i m sure it work well with other product and it s own app but i never would have purchased it without the echo they are a great duo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
don t buy if you want a dependable solution,2.0,it work when it connects to the network unfortunately it frequently disconnect itself despite strong signal strength rendering it purpose meaningless also it get annoying having to unlock your phone scroll to the app wait for the app to open hope the device is connected refresh refresh refresh and then finally be able to turn the light on or off faster just to walk over to the light and turn it on or off directly the app ha problem too but this probably isn t the best place to review that,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
could not get to work,1.0,unfortunately this product is not that great i wa excited to have the wemo switch arrive in the mail and could not wait to set it up alongside my amazon echo i couldn t sync it to the wifi network and once i did it would disconnect i spent 3 hour trying to figure it out and just had to send it back to amazon i do not recommend the product 1 5 star in the future i plan on going with the samsung smartthings hub and product video review http youtu be paptpm4jovy,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
you have them connected to your network they work fine the only downside i found wa the instruction,3.0,once you have them connected to your network they work fine the only downside i found wa the instruction really are pretty bad you will have to figure it out for yourself because the device were found but the install app kept on looking for the device extremely annoying firmware would have been cool if it had a dimming feature,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

very disappointed i would not have bought another wemo if,3.0,i rated this product 3 star this time only because i wa told that it would work with my television only to find out that it will not turn my television on just off to turn if off every time requires me to have to reset the television each time i wa told that i can t turn my television on because it is a digital tv most are very disappointed i would not have bought another wemo if this information wa known previously,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good but,4.0,its great if it work but ha limitation i had to return the first one but the replacement wa fine the smart phone application is limited you cant migrate the application to another device with physically being with the wemo device not a big deal if in your home but a pain if a holiday home mile away the hardware can sometimes be a bit flakey sometimes when pairing with the app on the plus side amazon echo can also control these device on the same network,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
so incredibly terrible and completely unusable,1.0,i wanted to like this product i really liked the hub le idea but my user experience over the past 24 hour ha been dismal i d recommend the old x10 stuff before i d recommend this the first thing you need to do is get these moved from their own little network into your home s network to do this you need to download their android or ios app the number of permission that are requested by the app are stunning and disturbing they attempt to justify them but what really come out after you look around a bit is that they are completely unfamiliar with android development get comfortable with the innards of your phone because never before have you had to become so accustomed to your phone s force stop feature the app doesn t crash per se but it spends most of it time in a drugged out haze trying to remember the state of the world and the support document recommend uninstalling reinstalling force stopping and all kind of other indication of an app gone seriously seriously wrong but at least at this point you ve got light turning on and off but it all get so much worse once it asks for a firmware update the device ship with an ancient firmware such that it appears to take multiple step to get them up to the right level and each of those level is a nigh insurmountable task it start easy enough you just click the little upgrade button on the app that s when the blinking start the blinking oh god the blinking first it blink blue then green or is that amber then it turn off then it is blue again then it is off then it sits and blink amber for hour the documentation tell you that this mean that it is unable to connect to your network this is odd since the on off button still seem to function until they too stop responding and then they disappear from the network entirely so you re left with the one thing you ve been told to never do when updating firmware you power cycle it and it come back up maybe maybe you need to reset it maybe not but you might get it to show back up in the app after force closing and uninstalling and reinstalling it but you ll only discover that all those blinking light were nothing by a lie for it is still stuck at the original firmware version the blinking light now won t stop at all and you re beginning to think that saving the box wa a prescient move on your part after hour of fidgeting with this i m left thinking that my time is not worth this and these device need to go not back to the factory but to some third world electronics recycling fire where at least the device s burning corpse will keep a poor family warm for the night if they re able to sleep through all the blinking that is edit after continued misery with tech support they were returned today just in case it will save you time when you have to call them here s the script from the support people 1 what is the brand and model of wireless router 2 did you reset the wemo switch by holding the restore button for 15 second without the power and then plug in the wemo switch and still holding the restore button for another 15 second 3 have you tried using different handheld device in running upgrade 4 how far are the wemo switch from the router 5 have you tried changing the wireless channel of your router and used 1 3 6 9 11 6 did you clear cache or clear data on your android smart device 7 are you able to disable and enable remote access without any error 8 are the wemo rule created being followed after answering those question these came back 1 please change the wireless channel of your router and used 1 or 9 2 make sure the 2 4 ghz ssid wireless name is not the same 5 ghz ssid 3 check if the upnp is enabled on your router 4 ensure to disable igmp vlan vpn are other advanced security on the router 5 port forward or port trigger port on your router 3475 3478 5228 8080 and 8443 nevermind that you can only forward one port to one switch 6 disable enable remote access on wemo app 7 disable mobile data and connect to 2 4 ghz network and run firmware update i don t even know what this mean 8 lastly disable router firewall temporarily to allow firmware update of wemo to go through,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

do you need to control your light from your phone,2.0,the switch is a advertised however one should think about whether it will be useful if you re in a small apartment for example there isn t much reason to be able to control a light from your phone when you can easily take a few step to turn it off the main reason i purchased this wa for the scheduling feature to turn on a light in the morning a a visual alarm and in that regard it work albeit clunkily the app feel somewhat primitive and isn t easy to use for example it should be a straightforward exercise to set a time to turn on and off a switch with a single action instead it requires multiple step also the unit is fairly bulky and block another port on a power strip overall i can t say it s a bad product but i think it s worth asking if it s a needed component in your house,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

pain to install and keep working not plug and play,1.0,1 5 star this wa a pain to deal with from the start installation took 3 4 attempt to fully get the device broadcasting and then getting the app to work with my wifi after finally getting it set up it worked for 2 day until a firmware update wa needed after that the wemo plug stopped broadcasting over wifi i had to do a manual reset which involves holding down this annoying restore button for upwards of 30 second after the plug wa restored i had to go through the set up process again with twice a many error got the device working again only to have the app not find the plug a device like this should be plug and play there should be no need to have to contact customer service to find out why the device isn t broadcasting router setting should not have to be changed and i sure shouldn t need to do a fresh install every time there is a firmware update perhaps update in the future will fix these issue but i am not paying 40 per plug to be a beta tester for belkin when it work it s extremely convenient but there are still far too many bug to recommend this for anyone,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

don t waste your time or money,1.0,i would give this no stars if i could after wasting my entire day making three phone call spending hour on hold and an on line chat with an almost non existent customer service department with belkin the wemo switch f7c027 will still not connect to my amazon echo which is the only reason i bought the switch light switch i had no problem connecting my echo to the four 4 honeywell wifi thermostat in my home so i know what to do i have sent an e mail to belkin hoping that maybe their weekday staff is better informed than their weekend crew so i will wait to return everything until i hear from them hopefully they will be able to tell me what to do to get these item to connect to echo i really want this to work if not then these switch will be going back to amazon,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

easiest plug n play module,5.0,bought this for my senior parent the love it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
poor security poor connectivity option,1.0,there are two huge flaw with this device it doesn t work on 5 ghz wi fi which is really useful in congested urban area or apartment and more importantly can t handle secure network password the latter issue is a deal breaker if your wi fi password ha any character other than number and letter then this device can t connect to use it you need to lower the security profile of your network and use password that are easily prone to hacking given the recent spate of malware attack on iot device it really inconceivable that a mainstream company would be so extremely careless personally i m not going to change my network password and reconfigure a dozen device just to accommodate the limitation of the wemo switch unfortunately i didn t try to hook up the device right away so it probably can t be returned and it s become a pretty useless paperweight i love my phillips hue light and their alexa echo voice control i wa hoping that wemo would provide similar satisfaction but i have to recommend that people look at phillips and other option rather than wemo belkin,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

unreliable,1.0,performance wa unreliable it would not work with my android phone but it did work with my android tablet however while it worked on my home network it would not work on the network for which i had purchased it if the belkin logo had not rubbed off when i removed an inventory sticker i had placed on the device i would have returned it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
belkin nuff said,3.0,if you are familiar with belkin product you will know what i mean it is inexpensive and look like it should work but doe not work well or easily configuration is a pain,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
in my opinion a bad design,1.0,convoluted way to initialize you have to connect your computer to the wifi the plug put out then the app attempt to get on your home network it is the first thing that would not connect to my home wifi you think the app would sigh to your wifi and find the device complicated for no good reason i returned 2 of them,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

two hour of my life wasted on wemo,1.0,first review ever posted this product come with very little in the way of instruction half way through the setup a message pop up on the app that ha a link to a web page at belkin with vague instruction about changing the wi fi setup on your android phone so that the product will not disconnect the setting referenced don t even exist on android marshmallow at least i couldn t find them i had to go to youtube just to find out how to reset the device for multiple attempt at setting up two hour of my life wasted on wemo purchased two of these and they are both going back tomorrow,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
flawed,1.0,when it turn on it default to off position so for example in my case i wanted to use the plug to turn on off my wifi hub and it doesn t work since the plug default to the off position when plugged in and you can turn it on unless it ha wifi coverage which won t happen since the device is turned off crazy poor design,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
app is not free,1.0,the packaging containing the wemo say it includes a free app for android and ios however apple charge 1 99 for the wemo app what if i don t like it i m still out 2 bill returning wemo over this issue,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
a 50 lightswitch,1.0,this thing is junk and is not ready for primetime i think it s good to note that it s made by belkin one of the leading manufacturer of overpriced iphone ipad ipod case i remember paying thirty buck for a belkin ipod case that inherently scratched the screen of my new 2003 30gb ipod i wa in college at the time so throwing the 300 buck down on the initial purchase wa killer a it wa then a product that s supposed to protect it scratched it in the word of gwb fool me once belkin shame on you fool me twice er uh not gonna get fooled again this device doe not consistently connect for local or remote access it s incredibly buggy the ui is laughable it s advertised a plug and play with little to no set up yet couldn t be further from the truth at the time of this posting belkin ha removed a majority of their support documentation on their website yet continues to sell this overpriced garbage hm how can they get away with that i m having problem and have no legit resource to troubleshoot home automation is close belkin is not going to be the service standard to take u into the 21st century stay away,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
stay away from these,1.0,garbage product unknowledgable customer service i have set up nearly every type of wireless product on my network including competitor smart plug and have never had a problem these would not recognize through mac filtering and the rep told me to turn off my security to set them up and then turn it back on afterwards not to mention they advertise free software for android and ios yet there is no free software for ios on the appstore,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

belkin is asking you to give out all your personal information and take some of the security down on your wireless to run a ligh,1.0,not ready for prime time will not work if you do not broadcast your ssid this device will not work with amazon echo without the belkin app which requires quite a bit of personal information for example device app history identity contacts why location phone number photos why do they need your photo to run a light switch camera and device id and call information the app is a personal security nightmare belkin is asking you to give out all your personal information and take some of the security down on your wireless to run a lightswitch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

good switches no hub required check out ifttt make sure the price is worth it for you,4.0,good switches no hub required check out ifttt i m editing my review because i now own both the outlet switch and light switch i like the idea of having switch that don t require a hub like so many others do i own this light switch a well a the version that plug into an outlet see my review of that one a well i think that the wemo platform is stable and well thought out although i do wish there wa a laptop desktop non mobile interface if you only have a few switch it is fine but if you had like 3 or more it would get cumbersome don t let the other review scare you if you are technology competent i hesitated to buy this because of the connectivity problem in other review i can only conclude that those people are more like my grandmother than myself i will say that installing the light switch requires a bit of electrical knowledge or at least willingness to learn and a bit of patience with the wifi setup i also had to switch wifi network at one point and it wa a bit of a hassle and required a decent amount of googling around forum there is a helpful video on this page no it isn t absolutely an easy 1 2 3 set up but i don t really have any complaint either this thing doe what it say it doe ha a good app and work well for me in the app you can also set up more complicated rule for on off so it isn t like your light go on and off at the same time every day making it obvious they are on a timer you can use sunrise set i also like that you can disable rule without deleting them so i can basically have a set for when i m home and a set when i m out and it is a simple transition from one to the other what i like about the light switch a opposed to the outlet switch is that you can use it without the app you can just press the switch and never have to care that it is a wemo switch if you want this is nice because with the outlet switch you have to leave the lamp on and control it only with the app yes there is a button but it is inconvenient this mean that guest or anyone else ha to learn about your nutty setup just to turn on a lamp this light switch fix this problem and i really enjoy that i travel a lot for work and so i use these mostly a a light timer just so it isn t so obvious when i m not home what i like is that when i am in a hurry out the door i don t have to bother setting anything and i can just do it once i m waiting at the airport you can do all kind of nutty stuff like setting it up with a motion sensor but for me it is just a controllable light timer it should be noted that this literally 16x the price of a normal light timer so you pay a hefty premium for all of this i have the light switch installed in my bedroom and i use it to help myself wake up i m a heavy sleeper and having the light turn on is a huge help by the time you are reading this i will assume that you know that the light switch will require a neutral wire and a deep electrical box this is almost guaranteed in newer construction but you should check you switch box before purchasing obviously this doesn t apply to the outlet switch an often overlooked aspect of the wemo platform is the ifttt integration i think this provides two huge opportunity the first is that you can add do button to your lock screen this mean you can control the light without unlocking your phone or opening an app it s just like swiping up and opening the camera i ve included a picture of what this look like the second nice part of the ifttt is that you can utilize the actual if functionality for example i have mine setup so that if i lose my phone i can press and hold the light switch and it will call me however i bought the light switch when it wa 42 and it ha been going up in price i think that a it approach 50 the competition really open up and the alternative are worth consideration this is a 20 price hike and i think that is substantial also two minor complaint first the outlet switch itself if huge i feel like it should be 1 3 the size it is also the light switch ha an indicator light on it which is a bit bright for my taste you can see in one of the picture that i have a bit of card stock taped over it to make it dimmer,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

deeply disappointed,1.0,loved this at first bought it a a christmas gift for my husband along with amazon echo although it wa a initially a bit difficult to set up it worked like a charm had to reset it once again a bit cumbersome holding in the reset button for 12 second while plugging it in but once reinstalled no issue until a few week ago the device stopped working again went through the reset procedure and can get it to work with the wemo app but alexa echo fails to recognize the switch went through all the troubleshooting recommendation and still no go plugged it into another outlet and lamp and still nothing alexa responds to everything else she just cannot detect this device very disappointed for the price would not buy another i don t know if it is and alexa problem or a wemo problem i may try another manufacturer to see if it is any better,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
smart plug,1.0,why is the wemo switch referred to here a wemo switch smart plug i find no reference to smart plug on the wemo website actually i think smart outlet would be a more appropriate name but wemo needs to give it a unque product name and and update their website so we can find stuff about this product on their website i ve tried to find an operation manual to no avail so i can find out what the restore button on the back of the thing is something so simple and yet nowhere to be found an operation manual would also hopefully document all state of the status light try looking for that info here or on wemo website impossible update 7sep2016 i stumbled upon didn t find it via search the status light info at 122247 search for 122247 on the wemo website support page i also stumbled upon what the restore button is for covered in a youtube video yuvfmvbq7wm search for yuvfmvbq7wm at youtube com that video tell you to press and hold the button while plugging the device back into the outlet and release after 5 10 second previously i wa just pressing the restore button without unplugging and replugging the device back in i did the correct procedure and my 3 wemo switches outlets have not dropped their connection all day and have worked like they should previously i wa finding these thing to be very unreliable and needed reset sometimes multiple time a day yes i ve did everything on their 7960 webpage updated firmware etc etc however i did not set my router to use a specific channel shouldn t have to for none of my other device require that if the power blink they come back online by themselves no mus no fuss but like i said above they ve been working okay for almost 24 hour now so i m keeping my finger crossed i have a galaxy note 3 and don t keep up with android version,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

review for basic outlet switch only,5.0,this review section is confusing a amazon combine review for nearly the whole wemo line of product into one i can t tell how well my product is reviewed by other customer but this review is for the switch which is a device that plug into an outlet and provides an alternative outlet that is controlled by the device the version i bought doesn t provide information about electricity usage it just turn power to your appliance on off initial setup wa a bit rocky the device take a few minute to establish itself and start sending out it own wifi signal i think people will have better luck connecting their phone to the device if they wait 10 minute after plugging it in once the app connects to the device and you ve updated the firmware you re set to go and can access it from home wifi the device can be connected remotely from outside home wifi but this ha to be set up every time you connect a new device i have 2 of these outlet switch and had to disconnect and reset the remote connection after setting up the 2nd switch it s been running a week so far and no trouble at all it work via 4g although it say 3g on the app or wifi and ifttt work fine a well no complaint update a week later still no problem from browsing the web i noticed a few helpful hint 1 the box state it need to be connected to a wifi router but there are all kind of router and i am not sure if it connects to every one mine is connected to a 2 4ghz band b g n router actually it s connected to an apple airport base station router that ha both 2 4ghz b g n and 5ghz a n band but it connected itself to the 2 4ghz b g n band if you don t have a g router or don t know what your router is check the web or call belkin i bet most people have g capability on their router so it may not be an issue 2 i noted that someone on the web had an issue with his router s security setting it wa set to wpa wpa2 personal which didn t work he reset it to wpa2 personal without wpa and that worked mine wa set to wpa2 personal from the beginning so i had no issue 3 the ssid name of your wifi network apparently can t have 2 capital letter according to a post on the web so myweb won t work but myweb will my ssid complies but if this is true i wouldn t be surprised if it s the major reason people have issue connecting with their wemo device i haven t found any other wrinkle by luck my router and it setting worked fine from the outset none of these setting are mentioned on the packaging or the one page instruction i could not find system requirement on belkin s wemo page either hope this help someone,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
weak wifi signal get a tp link instead,2.0,the tp link is far superior to this switch i think the big problem is the strength of it s wifi it took me 30 minute to get it to work in the first place because it took a long time to connect then a long time for the app on my iphone to find the device on my network then i put it in my garage because i wanted to set the timer for my christmas light it couldn t reach my wifi signal in the house from there even though i have other device that do i swapped out a tp link switch tp link smart plug wi fi works with alexa control your devices from anywhere hs100 and it connected instantly and it is now running my light considering the wemo is at least 10 more it s definitely not worth it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
for use with the echo your going to be disappointed simply put,1.0,if you planning on buying this for use with the echo your going to be disappointed simply put amazon say it compatible it s not i received mine and after not being discoverable to the echo i spent 2 hour with belkin bottom line is that you have to perform numerous firmware to make it echo compatible however i wasn t able to perform even the first firmware upgrade it simply would not talk to the belkin mothership despite an excellent signal to the router so is it compatible after a firmware update beats me never made it past the first version firmware update,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

initial setup is hit or miss when it s connected it work well,3.0,updated 3 15 17 as the title said my initial setup wa tedious taking a few try to work but now that i ve replace the router home wifi wa flaky this plug work fine 99 of the time original review i have 3 wemo device i only bought this one via amazon 1 light switch a switch smart plug and an insight switch i got them all a month apart because i wanted to avoid paying for a hub from another manufacturer i also chose it because i saw reasonably good review here on amazon i figured that since i m technically inclined i wouldn t have the trouble that others reported but i ve found getting them connected initially is very flaky and it s taken multiple try for each of them requiring a device reset each time connecting to my wifi network ha been the toughest part though i also find them very slow setting up their own wifi to enable this connection taking up to 5 minute to show up each time since each device took 3 8 try to complete that s a lot of frustration and wasted time i have two locked wifi connection but the iphone app didn t recognize the password entry properly the first time for any of the wemos the iphone app is also very finicky at identifying a new device and it also doesn t allow you to change wifi network i also have an amazon echo that us my wifi but it managed to get the wifi password directly from my phone so i didn t need to re enter it why can t the wemos do that this original switch smart plug wa working pretty solidly for a few week but wa offline for a while last night now the other two are offline and only this switch outlet is connected seen by the iphone app i just contacted support though i don t have high hope i am so glad that i didn t install one of these on my elderly mother in law s tv a i wa planning i do enough tech support for her a it is,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

which is worse the device or the app,3.0,either the switch won t connect to my wireless or the app shuts down before i can complete set up i ve been restarting my phone the wemo switch and my router i ve uninstalled reinstalled cleared my cache i ve been on the phone with wemo support nothing work now the theory is that the problem is the latest version of the app it is too new but the old one is not available seriously do yourself and your sanity a favor and find a different product update 1 hour and 45 minute on the phone with tech support and about an hour and a half on my own and now i have 2 working wemo switch worth it not yet but at least they work i had to use both an iphone 5 and a samsung s5 because i could only accomplish the initial set up with the iphone but then the wemo only properly work with the samsung phone the way i wanted it my echo is really how i control it and that pairing wa a breeze i still suggest a better switch i have one more wemo switch in it box which i am too scared to set up at this point i ll wait until a weekend where i have absolutely nothing else to do and then attempt it way too much work for an outlet,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
promising but set up and wifi reliability let it down,2.0,promising would be the best word to describe the wemo switch unfortunately it fall short the set up is very finicky often losing track of the wifi network i ve told it to join even when right next to the base station hit join fail hit join fail hit join fail hey it worked immediately it asks for a firmware update which kill the unit so i repeat the whole process again it s now been over an hour of mucking around with the wemo on my 3rd attempt the unit stayed online but i have not unplugged it to see if it will survive a power down i m not hopeful belkin 1 fix the app it crashed on me several time latest ios7 iphone 5 2 fix the firmware upgrade process to not break your setting 3 find out why your wifi is so unreliable and fix it 4 polish the set up process this wa possibly the worst wifi device set up i ve been through would a micro usb port be too much to ask for bouncing back and forth between wifi network ssids is clumsy at best and mostly just unreliable hacky,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
one star,1.0,didn t work at all sending back,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great with alexa,5.0,this wa definitely an easy set up i surprised my child with bit and piece of our smart home including an echo dot hue light harmony hub and i added the wemo switch just to see their face when they walked out on christmas morning and i said alexa turn on the christmas tree naturally once the tree come down in a couple of day i ll be putting this on a lamp and will rename the switch i d definitely recommend this a an addition to your smart home the price is right the set up is simple and it function exactly a intended if this review helped you please check that it wa helpful thank you,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
best smart home gadget i own,5.0,the wemo switch is a very easy to use device that can come handy in many different scenario you can use the switch to power just about anything that can be plugged into a standard outlet i have 2 lamp hooked up to my switch that are set to turn on and wake me up every morning at a certain time the possibility with the wemo switch are endless to turn it on you can manually click the button but the best way is through your phone you can even turn it on from the other side of the world no joke to get the switch up and running you need download the wemo app which is available for ios and android the app will give you a simple set of instruction on setting it up it s shouldn t take any more than 5 minute to finish my tip for you is to make sure that the wemo is connected under the same wifi network that your phone is connected to a super awesome feature of the app is rule you can set specific rule for the switch with rule you can make the switch turn on and off at specific time on specific day you can even have it turn on at sunrise each day you can also manually virtually click the button inside the app to turn the switch on or off overall the wemo switch is a very reliable product that can be used in an infinite amount of situation please note that it is not made of the high quality plastic but is still durable this doesn t effect me because mine is hidden behind a nightstand the only problem i have found is that the outlet on it is a very tight fit you can look at this in a good and bad way it is good because whatever you plug in it will never get pulled out of the outlet accidentally this is bad if you need to move the wemo switch around and plug device in and out on a daily basis to be honest the tight outlet doe t affect me because i don t even have a reason to unplug my lamp from it i am sure over time it would get looser the more thing you plug and unplug from it so if you are looking for a place to start in the smart home world this is great way to start if you own other wemo product you can also control them inside the same wemo app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
looks like we re throwing away all of these plug a a,1.0,this worked for about two month and then we such internet provider and thus ended up with a new wireless network name and password which we are now trying to switch the wemo device over to if you ever find yourself in the same situation then may god help you because these were not designed to ever be updated in any way looks like we re throwing away all of these plug a a result we ve spent hour trying to reset reinstall etc all to no avail,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
need a new qa team,1.0,i have tested 3 of these unit all with the same poor result the firmware fails to maintain connection to the network which prevents the app from showing the correct status and prevents the user from manually pressing the button to turn off light the only way to turn off on light when in this state is to unplug the outlet and replug this kind of behavior on firmware is blatantly unacceptable the firmware test group need to preform many many more extensive test the unit will only work 24hrs before require power cycling in order to get it back on the network and allow the manual switch to work,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
two stars,2.0,nice idea doe not work quite a well a i would like,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
disappointed,1.0,i am disappointed in this device it ha great potential the mobile application is good and it ha integration with ifttt it is very straightforward to setup the setup is similar to other device in it class once on the wireless network it soon forgot it wa connected i had to reset the device several time to see it again every now and again it woke up for a little while but then dropped off the network again i have no reason to believe the device is faulty it is just flakey typically a faulty device would exhibit some type of extreme behavior as far a accessing it remotely this is just a flakey on and off obviously because it cannot stay connected to the wireless network the last thing i tried wa to create a new dedicated wireless network just for the device i let it run for a week and could only connected to it twice for brief movement i purchased a tp link wi fi smart plug a few month back and this device is incredibly stable my only complaint is that it doe not support ifttt which is why i tried the wemo but i will stick with the tp link product belkin also dropped support for their developer api due to lack of interest if i had to guess the lack of interest is due to the instability of the device if a company want stop play in the iot or home automation space a developer api is critical in my opinion maybe dropping the api is an indication that they are not serious about this product space,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
horrible product horrible support,1.0,really i cannot express my disgust and disdain for this product i went all in and bought 10 for the house the setup process is not hard but is a pain and it is hit or miss the biggest pain and if you do your research you will find this out on your own these damn thing just disconnect randomly and then you have to go through the 20 minute process ot fix each and every single one any time there is a firmware upgrade they lose all their info including your network name their connection detail their name you have set everything and you have to go to each one individually and reset it you have to connect to the device by setting it up in your network setting a your network then hope that it connects after 30 second or so then open the app and hope it see the device then connect to the device name it set it up and then hope that it see your network i mean it is an ordeal and you have to do it all the time do not buy these,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great idea not ready for primetime,2.0,great idea not ready for primetime if you thought the setup of the wemo switch wa exhausting buggy and not a promised don t worry you ll have a chance to repeat your installation every three week while it is reasonable hardware and a great idea this version is too early and not ready it go off line randomly every 20 day and or else you find pleasure in asking alexa to turn off the light and finding out that you have to reinstall the switch yet again this product will frustrate you the idea is great the hardware look fine the software is not ready i m happy that i only bought one a amazon is now opening echo application to 3rd party and i will wait for a product well more consistent than this before a fill all my outlet with echo and future dot compatible device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
buggy software to say the least update 7 29 2017,1.0,let me just say on the outset that i have many of these smart home device from many different brand and they are almost more trouble than they are worth i m a retired it guy and i know my way around network hardware and software the problem with these device is they come with phone based software that s buggy to say the least and i have used the software on a variety of phone and version of android and it is very inconsistent and always ha problem and with all but my ihome device they almost always won t recover from a power failure without having to be re configured or re set up i m hoping that these device manufacturer will come out with some solid pc based software for their product because that would cure a lot of problem i have yet to get the software to work properly on my moto z2 play running android 7 1 1 as it finish up installing a new device it can t find the home wifi network so the setup dy i m glad i kept my old motorola razr running android 4 4 at least it will work after 3 or 4 attempt update 7 29 2017 it would appear now that not only can i not get both of these wemo smart plug set up one of them won t even reset and go into setup mode anymore they are both only about 7 month old and have only controlled light le than 75 watt,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

one star,1.0,it is useless,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
would not recommend don t bother if your wifi ha username and password even past that it barely work very slowly,2.0,yeah the title say all don t even think you might be able to try this if your wifi ha a username and password the wemo only will connect to an open network no password or a wpa2 wpa network at this point this product is useless to me because where i live ha a username password to use the wifi even at a different location where i wa able to test it at a relative s house after toiling around with the obnoxious setup and resetting restoring about 15 time this all took about a half hour it wa difficult to get the stupid thing working once it did finally start working it wa very slow with a very noticeable and prominent lag time of about 5 10 second from trying to turn it on off from the app and when it actually responded and mind you the wifi in that test location get about 130mbps download speed and 55mpbs upload speed for the non technical people this is pretty fast for a basic residential network also the app is horrible lag lag lag freeze crash restart lag some more useless only work about 30 of the time for me many people have left review on the app and tried contacting the company with no help i really wanted to love this because it would have solved several problem but it is definitely not worth the money not at all maybe 10 it s a toy that work once in awhile the company treat it like that and pay no attention to any of the problem i would certainly not recommend this product i only gave it the 2 star because it wa able to almost function a intended on a wifi network though again this isn t even my home wifi that i wa able to get it working on save your money or spend it on something else,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
poor performance with apple extreme wifi modem,2.0,if you are getting this item to connect with amazon echo and your home wifi is running off apple s airport extreme router it will not work the wemo switch only work on a 2 4ghz network band while the airport extreme transmits both 5ghz a well a 2 4ghz there is no way to force a network connection at 2 4ghz even though you can force a network connection at 5ghz don t know why apple doe this but it doe what this mean is that the echo will normally be running at 5ghz on your home network band but to connect echo with the wemo running only on a 2 4ghz connection both must be on the same network 5ghz but wemo only work on a 2 4ghz network so this can t be done in order to remotely turn the wemo switch on and off using a smart phone with the wemo app you first must go to the phone s wifi setting and discover the wemo s network and then connect to it rather than your normal home network running at 5ghz once it connects you go out of the settings and open the wemo app and wait 30 sec s to a minute for it to find the wemo switch very slow once it ha found the wemo you can turn the switch on and off very simply work a advertised after that you must go back to your phone s settings and reconnect with your normal home network generally running at 5ghz long and short it is both easier and faster to walk over to the wemo and manually turn the switch on and off which sort of defeat the whole purpose having voice command through echo is not possible using the apple airport extreme until wemo support 5ghz network connection,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it work well but,3.0,setup is a pain i thought it would never work and then all of a sudden it just worked i don t get it once it wa finally set up though it s been great no issue at all and alexa can turn on my desk lamp for me aside from that it s also bulky it s very bulky i wish it wouldn t hog surge protector space the way it doe i had to buy an extension so that it would fit i can understand why these thing need to be bigger than a real plug but the engineer really need to take usability into account especially on a plug finally no apple home kit integration wtf i know a lot of people don t have apple ecosystem and they like to be super vocal about it but there a lot of u that do prefer apple to everything else it d be nice if siri could access this and it s ridiculous that a company like belkin that s regularly featured in apple store ha not integrated the apple homekit into it smart home line of product the last reason for the 3 star rating is the price this thing is pricey for the wemo branding i got it on an alexa holiday deal for 20 and i couldn t in good conscience pay a penny more than that for this,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo smart switch misconceptions,5.0,i felt that i had to write this review about the wemo switch smart plug because of all the misconception i found in the review when i wa researching the purchase i hope this help others looking for a smart plug device i think it is a great device and simple to set up please note i did not receive any incentive nor free product from anyone for this review 1 the wemo switch smart plug take up both outlet i have the decora outlet when i plugged the wemo into the top outlet i wa able to easily plug in a tp 6 outlet surge protector into the bottom outlet it also appears that any 3 prong plug would be able to fit 2 the wemo is difficult to set up it took me approximately 8 minute to set up the wemo smart plug with a rule to boot a i first downloaded the wemo app but did not open it just to have it ready note if you plan to download the app to an ipad make sure to look for iphone only apps the free wemo will not appear if you are looking for ipad only apps b i then plugged in the wemo in to the outlet and followed the instruction on the app for locating the device in settings wifi and then hooking it up to my network it then asked me to update the firmware c i understand that setting up a second switch would go even quicker and would use the same rule a the first one 3 can t turn on remote access i plugged in my lamp and it prompted me to name or take a picture of the device it had the remote access on by default but i turned it off however when i tried to turn remote access back on it would not let me i remembered in my reading of the review that in order to turn on the remote option you must be on the same network i checked my wifi settings and sure enough my iphone switched itself to my regular wifi network and my wemo wa on the wifi extended network an access point when i changed the wifi on my iphone back to the extended network so that it matched the network the wemo wa on it allowed me to turn on the remote access with no problem this actually took 2 of the 8 minute 4 i then set up a rule for turning the light on and off at a preset time what a pleasure and last but not least i wa able to easily link the wemo to my echo dot by going to settings smart home and discover device i can now tell my wemo to turn on or off by speaking to alexa i hope this review help i now plan on purchasing a few more of these for some other lamp that are using timer i would love for belkin to come out with more smart type of device like a water sensor similar to the d link dch s160 wi fi water sensor,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

was working just fine until a recent firmware update 10062 which now ended,2.0,was working just fine until a recent firmware update 10062 which now ended the lovely relationship wemo wa having with amazon echo it went from working great to not even being discoverable at all it still work in the native wemo app but the whole reason i m using the switch is to have echo control it so i don t have to pull out my phone others are having this issue a well and calling wemo belkin support hasn t achieved anything from this post in the wemo help forum you can see that others are having this issue too first post from 1 8 2016 with the latest firmware update 2 00 10062 amazon echo no longer recognizes any of the 15 switch i have in my house with the exception of some problem in the very beginning when i first installed the switch they have been working flawlessly for month and through several firmware update anyone else have this problem the solution provided by wemo support is hardly a solution just passing the buck on 1 27 2016 amazon ha informed u that there is an issue on their end that something in our 10062 firmware exposed though they haven t informed u exactly what the issue wa or what condition would manifest this issue they have scheduled a patch to echo device for february 2 that they say will resolve the issue with wemo device running 10062 firmware we ve been unable to replicate whatever condition are necessary to expose this issue if we could we d try to analyze for root cause and see if there wa any change we could make to expedite a fix for affected user as it is we are simply waiting for amazon to flip the switch to resolve the problem for those of you who are experiencing it i understand just how frustrating this is i would be quite irked if this were happening in my own home a alexa integration to my switch is one of my favorite thing for those affected next week you should be able to say the same about your own home still nothing work via echo for wemo everything else that i ve got connected to echo work flawlessly this is another example of half baked firmware released too soon by belkin ironicly i wa about to buy a bunch of additional wemo light switch wi fi enabled control your lights from anywhere not compatible with amazon echo until this happened,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

not easy to set up or troubleshoot often disconnect from wifi making it useless,1.0,initial setup is a bit of a pain but work only if you want everything that interacts with it using 2 4 ghz even allows you to set it to go on and off based on sunset sunrise when it work when i changed my wifi router however modifying this switch wa a pain the reset button did not do what it wa suppose to do no matter how long i held it down or unplugging it and replugging it in while holding the reset button a one site suggested i had to delete the device and follow the instruction a if it wa a new device latee when trying again unplugging and holding the reset button while plugging it in and for 15 second after plugging it in did work after only owning it three month it is often disconnected from my wifi and therefore not turning on when it s programmed to do so makes it useless i thought it wa my router i contacted wemo and they told me it only work with 2 4ghz maybe it doe but when i set it up with my phone in december i wa able to set it up to connect to my router and everything worked great now it can t say if the dsn for my 5ghz router wa listed or not but i connected and everything worked even though my phone wa always connected to my 5ghz wifi dsn and it worked with my alexa enabled device echo dot fire stick fire tablet all of which are connected to my 5ghz wifi dsn there wa a wemo software upgrade a of a month or so ago my light wa no longer turning on a programmed and when i brought up the app the wemo switch wa often greyed out and then a few minute later it wa accessible the light went on a programmed for a few day and then stopped working again one night it just turned on by itself at about 1am no rule to make it do so and no accidental turning on via app or alexa turned it off and about 20 minute later it turned on again figured i need to start from scratch which i did but the light doe not turn on consistently using the rule i set up and it appears greyed out on the app and then is accessible i talked to support but all they did wa tell me it wa never going to find my 5ghz wifi dsn and told me i should change my other device to be on that network really i want the high speed to stream why would i downgrade just i can use this switch my nest doesn t have that problem everything in my house recognizes both my 2 4ghz wifi dsn and my 5ghz wifi dsn but not this device recommend you do not buy this expensive switch unless you never stream and or have slow internet service so you don t care that it ha this restriction and i have serious concern that it would still act erratically a mine is doing after le than 3 month,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
for novelty use only,1.0,it work well enough if you set it up once never touch it and never have any power outage but changing my wifi network s name essentially bricked this thing you see there is no way to change the wifi setting after initial configuration instead belkin instructs you to do a factory reset well if you have ifttt configured or have more than one of these that could literally take hour and it simply isn t worth the time and effort just to be able to control your light remotely or with your voice with alexa i really wish i would have researched this device better before purchasing i have a tp link switch that work much smoother and changing the wifi setting on that wa just a easy a you think it would be it s almost a if belkin went out of their way to make this thing difficult,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
sometimes the smipliest action is all that s required to fix a complicated problem,5.0,i received a wemo switch a a christmas gift a couple of year ago it wa easy to set up and connect to a lamp i could turn on and off remotely with my iphone i liked it so much i bought a second switch and rigged up a second light no problem then i attempted to set up a third i couldn t get my wifi to recognize the device i tried everything i could think of with no result i went online and read what worked for others who d had the same problem i even contacted belkin support and followed their instruction in the process of uninstalling and reinstalling plugging and unplugging my previously installed switch wouldn t work i wa desperate so i decided to call belkin support knowing full well i d most likely be put on hold for a long time i did have to wait a while but it wasn t a long a i thought it would be the wemo switch tech guy i spoke to michael wa incredibly patient with me i did everything he directed some of which i d already done but hoping this time would have a different result nothing worked but michael wa a determined a i finally he asked if i had turned off my modem router that wa the one thing i hadn t done i turned it off even went so far a to unplug the modem router waited a few minute and re plugged it turned it on and with michael s step by step instruction set up one of my switch voila it worked i proceeded to set up the other 3 without a problem before calling belkin i had received question in my research about my router number that i didn t understand but no where wa it suggested something so simple a unplugging the modem router and letting it set before plugging it back in i love my wemo switches and recommend the product without reservation,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
amazon echo integration makes this a must,5.0,background i bought my wemo plug for a floor lamp and my christmas tree light and these thing work great i absolutely love the integration with my amazon echo a well app the app is easy to use and easy to set up there are a lot of cheaper off brand of these but i don t trust how they are set up in term of the actual product wifi security a well a the app security how the app handle your sensitive information you can trust belkin you can t trust some of those other apps and company some of which are based in china and may not have security in mind build like i touched on in the app section these thing produce their own wifi signal and if you go with an off brand i believe the access to your router and personal internet security could be easier to access that part bothered me i could totally be wrong but it s definitely a piece of mind using a trusted brand the build itself is pretty sturdy i m don t think it s meant to be used in more extreme condition but i ve been running a wemo smart plug in my uninsulated garage a well for month and it handle cold and hot weather like a champ amazon echo integration now i thought using the app to turn the light on and off would be easy but to be honest i don t even fire up the app anymore the integration with amazon echo is amazing i am able to just turn off my lamp and light with really natural voice command it s a game changer if you re on the fence don t settle for cheaper alternative the wemo line is not purely just quality but is much more secure to me the app is much easier to use and it s integration with amazon echo make this product absolutely amazing,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
extremely unreliable,1.0,i have two light that plug into a ceiling recepticle i wa hoping to use the wemo to turn the light on and off from the ground unfortunately the device is extremely unreliable it will stay connected only for a few hour or a few day at most before losing signal then i have to get a ladder to unplug and replug it back in i have two unit and they both work this way over the past one year i have done multiple firmware update hoping reliability would improve it ha not made a bit of difference i do also have an amazon echo and it is pretty neat to turn on and off wemo device but what is the point if you have to constantly unplug and plug them in,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
old model obsolete,1.0,my mom bought me one of these for christmas of 2015 i believe i wa super stoked i immediately ran home downloaded the wemo app wa ready for to set it up to my dismay disappointment i discovered that the wall outlet in the room i had intended for set up needed replaced for reason unrelated to this product irrelevant to this review so i tucked the belkin smart plug into a drawer there it remained until last week nov 2017 when i decided to connect it with my new echo dot so that i could voice operate my bedroom lamp alexa enable wemo alexa turn on the light or whatever command one would use i never quite got that far now perhaps belkin had upgraded their product this particular model wa out of date which would be my guess it whatever the case may be i could not get the wemo to do anything but blink a blue amber colored light the wemo network option would pop up on my phone s wifi list for 0 05sec then vanish it would not connect to my home verizon wifi it would not connect to my echo dot none of the step in the app s set up guide nor any solution on the wemo help page were assisting me in the set up connection of the wemo device to any of the device hardware in the vicinity i should have prefaced by saying that i m not an electrical engineer but i have connected every single computer device of the electronic wireless nature that are found in my home in the past by myself with very little trouble but something wa wrong with this wemo device nothing absolutely nothing i did could get it to stop blinking blue amber just connect after about 2hrs of frustration i yanked the so called smart plug from the outlet whipped it across the room against the opposite wall my frustration had boiled over i had had enough of this piece of well i m sure you get the picture i have a strong feeling that the model i had had become obsolete un upgradeable unconnectable bottom line i think i will be switching manufacturer product on my next very near future purchase i m saying bye bye to wemo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not only useful but fun too,5.0,i ve only had this outlet plug for a few day so i m not sure about durability but thus far this is an awesome addition to our home it ha it own phone application so you can turn on whatever is plugged in to it from wherever you are i attached the light in our bedroom to so i will no longer have to navigate our room in total darkness to get to the light and turn it on the first day we had them i went to work leaving my my husband at home still asleep i kept switching them off and on and he couldn t figure out what wa happening yes it not it intended use but it sure wa fun being able to turn on your light when you are out of the house come in handy if you have a pet and are running late and don t want your furry friend to be in total darkness i also own an echo and connected the outlet to that a well so i can turn on the light just by asking alexa to do it for me reminds me of the clapper device that came out decade ago but instead of being slightly goofy this really cool if these were cheaper i d have them in our kitchen living room and our other bedroom i did order this through the echo which saved me 10 but you could only order one at that price otherwise i would have ordered several hopefully a these become more popular and other manufacture start offering them the price will drop if not i will enjoy the one i have and maybe splurge at some point to get a few more the only down side that i have found so far is that the plug is huge so i could not use it in my power strip and ended up having to use the wall outlet i m sure that is probably a better place for it but i had to then plug the power strip i had connected there in to the other power strip i have in the other outlet regardless of that minor annoyance this is a very handy product that is helpful and a little fun a well,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
disappointed purchase,1.0,i purchased this device for my boyfriend to use with his amazon echo first thing the setup wa easy to follow we kept having to try and connect to wifi within the app itself we kept getting a password error when we were connecting it to wifi same password wa entered at least 5 time and on the last try it took it once we finally got it connected after numerous attempt to connect it to the device we were finally able to see the device connected that wa a far a it would go after adding the device it kept saying not detected so after my boyfriend failed attempt i tried it on my wifi at my home guess what the same thing happened the only difference wa i wa able to get connected after numerous attempt and numerous hard reset the switch showed up and it would allow me to control if remoteley all of about 4 time even then i had to reset it manually about 3 time i noticed that there wa a firmware update i tried to do the firmware update and nothing happened when i tapped it after tapping it a few time it lost connection with the wemo switch this experience wa horrible i got this for my boyfriend who wanted this for month to use with his amazon echo that i got him for christmas i am sending this back to get a refund i would never trust this device to do what i wanted it to do while i wa away from home honestly it is dangerous,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
amazing device that can make life much easier,5.0,i recently purchased an echo so i decided to get a few of these to go with it i use one for each bedside lamp in my bedroom and the other for a crockpot the very first thing you have to do when setting it up is download the app once you have the app it give you step by step direction which are extremely simple all three connected quickly without problem then you can name each plug set schedule turn it on off and all of it worked flawlessly i wa pretty impressed by how quickly it all work being new to smart home device i expected there to be at least a little delay but it work a quick a flipping the switch then i opened the echo app and enabled the wemo section named the device for echo and just a quickly i wa able to control it by voice they work just a good when using your echo device which is even more impressive even using the alexa function built into my 50 amazon tablet work perfectly i have a few tp link smart bulb i bought a well and although they work great most of the time sometimes there is a delay or echo won t work the first time or they just unsync all together and i have to wait a minute for everything to sync back up but that never happens with these switch my fiance also ha the app on her phone and can control it a well and she ha reported no problem she love being at work and having the crockpot start whenever she is ready for it so that it s done right when it s time for dinner i would highly recommend p s i bought my from home depot that s why it s not verified i just enjoy these so much i wanted to let everyone know p s s what s some idea people have come up to use with their switch lamps are an obvious one but interesting idea like the crockpot i ve tried thinking of other item i d enjoy having the switch for but a lot of thing are digital so even if you can remotely give it power you still have to manually turn it on your washing machine for example you can turn the power on and off all you want but someone still ha to manually adjust the setting and press start,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
make sure you get the correct app,4.0,after some discussion we decided not to have any smart home device although we have 3 echo device in our house a friend gave u this switch smart plug a a gift though and i fell right to after an ugly hour trying to get it set up from my ipad i gave up and left it today i tried setting it up again and now i feel qualified to give some pointer if you re doing what i did last night the wemo app isn t available for the ipad only for iphone although you can use the iphone version on your tablet i bought the darned wemo switch app because that s the only wemo app i could see set it up using your phone unless your ipad ha a cellular connection otherwise it switch your internet over to the wemo network i think that s why i had network problem setting it up from the ipad it s really very simple i just made a few initial mistake that resulted in frustration if you re using a plug behind a piece of furniture don t move the furniture back until you have it set up with alexa she ll ask you to use the switch so she can find it i connected it to a lamp in the bedroom and now it s working fine alexa turn on the bedroom lamp and click on it go and she say okay very straightforward and satisfactory i ve set it to come on when alexa s morning alarm clock go off so we have immediate light and le opportunity to fall right back to sleep i honestly don t know if i can justify having more of these but a a gift this is very very cool,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

surprisingly bad,1.0,i bought this to use with ifttt and alexa i already use the tp link switch but wa disappointed to learn that they don t already have a good script the wemo plug wa on sale for 19 99 so i decided to get one and only use it for my main light and use ifttt to make it turn on when i wa within 5 mile of home i received the device in good condition and immediately set it up set up wa pretty frustrating but after a couple attempt it finally synced to both my smart phone and echo dot not sure if there is a trick to do this easier but it only took about 4 attempt and i had to reset my router a couple time this is where the problem start at first i thought it wa odd that i had to reset the router but didn t think much of it after about an hour my wifi disappeared and i had to go reset it again and again and again in fact ever since installing the wemo my wifi disconnect like clockwork weird because my router is also a belkin product i disconnected the wemo and i have had no issue with wifi outage i honestly can t say for sure what s going on maybe the wemo ping the wifi router too much and there s a security feature on my router that disconnect it i m sure someone out there could solve the problem but for me this ended up being a waste of money and a pain in the rump,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
just got it could use better direction,4.0,works great so far i ve only had it a couple hour but so far it doe what it say it will do only reason i give it four star is the set up instruction which is pretty much a few picture it doe actually set up pretty easy using the app on your phone name the device whatever you want it called i originally named it wemo then i plugged our small christmas tree into it and felt kind of stupid telling alexa to turn wemo on off i went back into the app and renamed the switch christmas tree to set it up with the amazon echo you have to get it on your wifi network and then tell your echo to find devices if you rename the device after your echo ha discovered it under the previous name tell alexa to find devices again it will then work with the new name and forget the old name lots of option such a hooking up with ifttt and your nest thermostat also able to set schedule currently is not compatible with wink hub,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

flawed setup but once it s up and running thing have been great,5.0,since purchasing i have consistently good connection and reliable use not sure if i am in the minority here but it ha been working perfectly for me not that i didn t have a hell of a time setting it up initially a many other reviewer have noted but once i got it up and running it ha been smooth sailing i have a lamp in my den plugged into it and then from there i have my ifttt account connected to the wemo and amazon echo i use my voice to turn the lamp on and off and the response time is incredibly quick i am very pleased with how everything work together those are the pro and they are very big pro but i would remiss if i didn t reiterate what so many others have before me setup can be a nightmare i initially used my nexus 6 initiate setup and wa met with every manner of error no response not able to find the wemo device stuck in setup mode device disappearing and reappearing in the app nightmare after 40 minute and several device reset i decided to try using my fire tablet in a last ditch effort before sending it back it set up and had everything running on the first try easy a pie i d recommend turning off everything but the wifi on your setup device when initiating setup seems to help greatly overall the setup is quirky i m being generous but once it s up i have had no problem whatsoever i will most likely buy a couple more for the bedroom before the end of the year update 5 28 17 still using my switch daily and have had a great experience overall i wanted to update this review to add that i recently switched to an iphone and upgraded to a better home router causing me to have to set everything up again a if new setup with my iphone wa alot quicker though i can t say that the update the device and app have received didn t play a part a well still thing are much better since i first reviewed this so i felt it deserved an quick amendment,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

needs a lot of work before you should buy it,2.0,many problem during setup it could not be connected to from my verizon motorola droid turbo after i connected to it from my older tablet and connected it to my network i could see it on my phone it said there is a new firmware to install then the android app crashed while displaying updating you must guess the cringing feeling of seeing something crash during a firmware update but the device wa fine since it did not install the update after all it responds to the turn on and off command with a severe lag and sometimes it just doe not do it at all the android app frequently loses connection to it and reconnects while i wa talking to belkin support it turned on on it own maybe it wa finally responding to one of the command it did not respond to so the bottom line is that i had way too many issue even during the initial setup this feel like an engineering sample more than a final product you should buy having problem with the device and it android app it seems to be working better with amazon echo dot though the response is still slow and sometimes requires more than one try,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
most unreliable consumer tech item,1.0,i ve ever owned the switch is unreliable and show up a not detected on a random basis i am not a novice and the cause is either a weak internal wi fi card or belkin s sever nothing wrong with my router moreover belkin support is useless and clueless l2 and l1 basically read from a script and whatever troubleshooting step you may find you are better off using google to find l3 if you can get your way through to them wa not helpful either belkin ha someone on amazon doing what i consider damage control because the complaint are numerous and they are consistent with the not detected issue i feel compelled to state my displeasure with belkin s crappy product to hit the company back instead of going through their hoop and hurdle to get decent help i recommend you file a complaint with the better business bureau or your state ag consumer affairs department that might light belkin s butt on fire for marketing a beta product don t buy this junk until belkin make it reliable is my advice to you update 5 12 2004 to assist consumer in hitting the company back for your aggravation and forcing a remedy belking is hqed in ca so it most efficient to contact these agency ca state ag consumer complaints bbb of los angeles where belkin is located belkin s address so you can fill out the form properly belkin international inc 12045 e waterfront drive playa vista ca 90094 imo the review across not just amazon but also newegg google play and apple store are consistently bad imo this product suffers from some defect in design and should actually be subject of a class action lawsuit if there is no remedy provided by the company to fix the problem update i came here to document belkin s poor customer service which is infuriating given the hold time and incompetence makes my blood boil at the indifference and poor training from another retailer i bought a switch which happens to be labeled va01 through google i discovered there is a va02 obviously a newer version the people at belkin could not tell me what is the difference and gave cursory answer basically indifferent to my concern when i asked if this meant she wa not sure she finally admitted yes as a consequence i am returning the product this is not to blame amazon but i feel people actually read the review on amazon for the time i wasted i feel that belkin should pay a steep price and that is lost sale if someone were to read this plus the other retailer the electronics last brick and mortar national standing should not be moving old inventory onto unsuspecting customer shame on them,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

could be easier to setup but certainly a must have for any smart home,5.0,i have 3 wemo switch now 1 smart plug and 2 insight plug i am really satisfied overall but i have a lot of networking and computer background and it still seems that these can be touch finicky to setup similar to setting up a google chromecast you make a network connect directly to the device and then it will connect to your wifi i have had to do this to each device a i add them even though the app should keep the network password and so on ultimately this should not stop anybody from buying these but they should be aware that depending on your network and mobile device it may take a touch of messing around to get them up and going however these are amazing product depending on how much thought you put into how you will utilize their magic you can really do some cool thing with the wemo family of product get some ifttt recipe cooking and you can have some real fun with these little gadget,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo switch is a great piece of equipment,5.0,the reason why i choose wemo switch instead of many other cheaper product are solely because of compatibility and realiability it work with all the device that i had such a alexa smartthings etc very easy to setup all you have to do is plug it into power source open wemo belkin app and select the wemo temp wifi setting up took about 3 minute for each wemo i have 3 of them connect to smartthing samsung and alexa amazon is pretty straight forward 1 for smartthings open smarrthings app navigate to marketplace at the bottom of the page choose smartthings labs choose belkin wemo switch labs choose connect now wait for 3 5 minute do not close the app just leave it there for 3 5 minute depend on your wifi connect all of the wemo switch previously connected to your wifi will be there to choose click and choose the desire switch 2 for alexa enable wemo skill on alexa and navigate to smart home to discover new device make sure the name for each wemo switch is not too similar to each other it will driving you nut later on if you do so lol international usage note eventhough this product is rated at 120v but i have been using it with 220v in viet nam for nearly 5 week and haven t got any problem since then there is no heating issue i m still alive so i guess everything is working but your mileage will vary use it on 220v with caution it might burn down your house i don t know and i certainly won t take any responsibility if you do so,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
out of box experience initial setup,1.0,just got mine for xmas got time to setup opened box surprised there wa really nothing there other than the device until i realizes the quick setup instruction are on the back of a piece of cardboard used inside the packaging the wemo app is required to do anything with the switch app is also required to have amazon echo access it but had to figure that out myself a there were no instruction or even mention of using wemo w echo there s also no information on product registration or warranty info anywhere to be found setup wa relatively easy but i ve experienced better you have to connect to a wifi ssid presented by the wemo first then send it your home wifi setting mine worked w o ssid broadcasting using wpa2 update 2 2016 unreliable product still work but ha had to be reset to factory default reprogrammed 4 time so far also unreliable via echo often needing to repeat command 3 4 time before light turn on off even though echo responds ok meaning that it think it wa able to do what i asked,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not a pictured,2.0,hmm not a pictured i bought this a a gift so it s still in the box it is indeed a wemo switch but it s a belkin wemo switch not mentioned in the description and it say belkin on it not wemo the look is also a bit different i m wondering whether the review here are for the switch pictured or for the switch i received i place my order heavily based on review so all of the review i read for this product might be useless if i received a different updated version giving it 2 star because it might work just fine but it is not a pictured and if i m purchasing a product i expect to receive the one shown,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
bulky yet very useful ha tool,5.0,this plug is the perfect solution to unique or otherwise troublesome home automation issue case in point my wife ha a tiffany lamp in the bedroom that she us to read by it us chandelier bulb so rather than replace the wall outlet with a smart one in order to add it to our network this switch integrated effortlessly with both the smartthings hub and the echo if i had to change anything with it i would integrate a rotatable wall plug a the unit is very bulky and depending on your need for the outlet it may require a 2 plug outlet on it s own thankfully that wasn t the case with u a i wa able to flip the other plug over but i just wanted to advise everyone ahead of time,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
ample for when needed but doe have a few minor flaw,4.0,i have owned my wemo switch since i received it a a gift for christmas we have just one and there have been numerous time i ve looked around the house trying to figure out where to add another one or two of these device but can t find the perfect spot i have too much connected to my entertainment system such a a cable box surround sound system etc in my medium room that need to be powered on every time but upstairs in the living room i just have the standard led tv mounted on a wall with no sound bar or anything attached so a long a the cable box is constantly on to record dvr s this ha worked out perfectly setup wa a breeze if i recall it took some finagling because it s bigger than you would expect and i had to move around some outlet it essentially cover up two spot on a power strip so keep that in mind i haven t downloaded any third party apps because there isn t much extra functionality that i need it for just to simply turn on and off whenever i request it to i turn it on and off remotely for our new puppy so he doesn t feel so lonely throughout the day from the app i also utilize amazon echo a ton to turn the tv on in the morning when coming down the stair and i don t want to fumble around looking for the remote in the couch cushion all great feature and i have no issue there except it doesn t always respond to my voice command to flip on and i don t think that is an issue with echo it work i d say 80 of the time correctly the others it simply doe nothing i m not sure if i ve had any issue when using the phone app only because when it turn green i assume it s on what do others use it for i ve seen for coffee maker clothing iron etc but to me that seems to be overkill if i wa to put it on my keurig it still won t make my coffee because there is another button to press the tv is the perfect spot because that usually requires another device remote for it to work now i have effectively added another way to turn it on besides walking over to the device and pushing the small button on the side of the tv myself if i lost the remote but aint nobody got time for dat it s a glorified power button and the price point turn me off a bit too this should be a 19 99 product not double that for what it doe get one try it out on the most simple of device in your home and hopefully you too will see it doe at least service it purpose,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works a advertised,4.0,owned this about 3 month now using it to schedule a table lamp with the solar programming recipe and turn on off with my amazon echo the app is very easy to use for programming echo operates it seamlessly with voice command i would give it 5 star but i found it not working one time so far i unplugged it from the power and back in again and it started working fine i am not sure if the device wa at fault or if the main power glitched at my home so i can t really place blame on the unit if i encounter future problem or none at all i will adjust the star accordingly this device set up fairly easy it will initially send out it s own wifi signal you use to connect to it so you can enter your home router s ssid and password once that is established you can enter all kind of scheduling recipe from the app so much easier then programming the digital timer i had before since this unit connects to your wifi it keep it time updated via the network make sure your router is set for the correct time or auto update my initial requirement for this purchase were that the unit would store the scheduling recipe and operate on it s own without app interaction and through power failure etc it ha done all of that just fine occasionally on a cloudy day i like to turn the lamp on earlier then the scheduled program so i use our echo device to do that longevity will be the next test for me to really decide,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
horrible item and dismal app,1.0,i received 2 of these a present i have to say that these are the worse electronics that i ve used in age if i could give zero star i would firstly you have to download their app which is really big and asks for access to all kind of personal info on your phone for really no reason other than what i d call to spy secondly after downloading the app you are likely not going to get the thing to work the app is a pain to get going too we tried diligently to get it to work on one the instruction are nonexistent and the online direction are not great nonetheless we did get one to work but only for one day trying to get 2 to work wa hopeless don t waste your money these thing are complete junk,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i like most everything but the size,4.0,very fast and easy to set up the device no problem connecting to my network or to my samsung galaxy edge 7 however setting up the connection to my echo wa another story that wa a challenge possibly because i have 2 echos i don t know but the echo couldn t seem to locate the device so maybe the wrong echo wa trying find it and it wa out of range i m just guessing anyway now that it is setup and running i really love being able to turn the lamp across the room on and off with voice command and being able to do it while i am away from home is a great security feature the only thing i really don t like is the size it is way too big next time i will get a mini,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i will use my good ol light switch,1.0,i should have paid attention to the other negative comment it worked for a few day with my echo and dot then it stopped i spent several hour over the course of the day to no avail i deleted the application and re loaded it at least 10 time i did a factory re set on the switch at least 20 time i tried it in different place in my home my wifi is very strong i re booted my router several time i re booted my phone several time even thought i have other working device on my network echo cannot find the device i finally called tech support and after they gathered all the marketing info they needed they listened to my problem the young lady wa appropriately courteous then put me on hold for a few minute when she came back she informed me that someone would call me within 8 hour no thanks it is not worth the time i have already invested i will use my good ol light switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great for somethings,5.0,i use the wemo switch for only a couple thing i have one echo two dot and a tap and utilize my amazon product to control my light and heat now phillips hue is great for light due to being able to dim and change color but there are somethings that i want to control from my echo and thats where the wemo come in i utilize it to control my blower for my wood burning fire place insert i also put one in my daughter room to control her lamp due to me not wanting to keep the electricity going to it all all time great connection never had connection issue easy to set up all and all a great device for making a regular item a smart item,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
very easy to use work like a charm and is kinda fun,5.0,we bought two of these and they re great we use them with our alexa for family and bedroom light i wa impressed by how easy it wa to setup took about 3 minute with the app on my iphone to get it on my wireless network with very simple question the alexa app then found it in second just a note pick a name for the switch that make sense to tell alexa i name mine family room lights and then connected all of my light to the plug with an extension cord now i just say alexa turn on family room light and they go on before we would go to each one lean over furniture etc and turn them all off this wa a pain when you fell asleep watching tv they also have a nice app that let you program time including vacation great job wemo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo plug in switch,4.0,to begin i purchased a couple of these wemo switch not from amazon but from dell so my review is solely on the device out of the box the packaging is very simple all that wa in it wa the switch and a card with instruction after plugging in the unit connecting my phone samsung s5 to the wemo s wifi signal i wa able to configure it using the wemo app i set it up on my home s wifi network same network that my phone us when i am at home and it wa connected i wa now able to turn the switch on and off from my phone i then had a notice to update the firmware which i did once that wa done i experienced some issue accessing the switch my phone app would be unable to locate the switch so i ended up resetting the unit and redoing the entire process again it ha been a little over a week now and it ha been working a i would have hoped i can turn the switch on off at home on another wifi network or on cellular service my only complaint about it so far is the size it basically cover up both outlet the loud clicking sound it make when you turn it on off and the issue i had initially with setting it up for simple home automation i d recommend this unit i am actually going to set up another one of these switch soon along with a couple of the light switch,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
should have switch d long ago,5.0,i bought this product at a home depot after trying various programmable outlet timer i consider myself a pretty tech savvy guy but the digital lcd display one are needlessly convoluted and complicated some even lock time zone to specific region the wemo is pretty straight forward plug in click the power button connect through your phone s wireless set up and open the app you can have multiple switch unit connected at once with varying timer it is very streamlined and very easy to use my only minor complaint wa that they didn t add in another outlet but that can just a easily be fixed i don t know the range too well but i have one in a basement and one in the upstairs living quarter and the wifi range is always on point,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great device with a couple of downside i like it,4.0,i like the device end it wok really well in my home integration a it stand today i use it with amazon echo ifttt and so far worked flawlessly sadly it will not work with apples homekit that is the only reason i never gave it a 5 out if 5 there is an article on the belkin wemo support site regarding why check it out sadly although i understand the logic and reason it is still a unhappy situation and one that i am disappointed in also i find the device a little bulky so when put in a wall outlet that ha 2 socket on it it take over the socket a bit and i occasionally find it difficult of find other plug that will still fit the 2nd socket plus a my socket are vertically aligned i cannot put two wemo switches on the same outlet because the they are taller than will fit maybe a double memo switch unit would be smart too make up for the issue but i cant get anything like that but it work great for me in my home and my automation need at this stage so i am very happy with it will i buy more maybe or i might look for alternative that work with homekit and will fit the socket better right now not sure about that will i get rid of my wemo switch nope they work great for me right now,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it s great when it work,4.0,it s great when it work which is about 85 of the time comes in handy for hard to get to plug and for setting up security light timer it doe however take up a bit room at the outlet and it ll go totally brain dead once in a while but a quick reset fix the problem i have a few of the new little guy that only eat up one plug on the outlet a well and they are awesome no issue with them connecting and are quicker to respond to command both work with alexa and that s just nut i ve got little one running around giggling while thing are turning on and off all day because the nice lady in the little hockey puck doe whatever they ask guess they feel empowered by it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
ok wish there wa better programming rule,3.0,this is a review of the standard ac outlet switch there are two way to program the control of this switch the wemo app for one phone pad ha some very basic rule that can be set to turn the switch on off then you can associate the wemo switch with an ifttt application and web page i found it easier to use the web page to write simple recipe to control the wemo switch there are probably some very interesting possibility with ifttt recipe if you are using the wemo switch to control light for example if you get close to home when driving the light coupled to the switch could be turned on unfortunately i wanted more complex control and the ifttt trigger are too simple for example i wanted to turn a recirculating pump for a water heater turned on and off every 15 minute between 7am and 10pm thereafter i wanted the pump completely shut off while there is a trigger to set every 15 minute it is active 24 hour per day that is there is no nesting of ifttt trigger anyway this is an interesting introduction to ifttt and it web server note that if you lose the internet connection to the wemo switch the ifttt server and the ifttt recipe will be unable to control it the built in rule of the wemo app are too basic and would require about 30 on rule and 30 off rule to accomplish what i want i am hoping the ifttt folk can improve the day time trigger to add some additional condition so that i can avoid the 60 rule of the wemo app i have been using this for a day so i am not sure of the reliability i have used the wemo app most locally and tested with a cell connection the icon on the button glow blue when the switch is turned on to provide power to whatever is plugged into it the wemo app ha a corresponding green ring around the power button when it is turned on when turned off the icon on the button is dark in the wemo app the green ring around the power button is dark thus you do get some feedback when the switch is on and off the speed with which a cell connection can control the switch is impressive we just need to beef up the program control some one more thing the wemo app is in the iphone store only an ipad version would be nice update after 3 day i went through three firmware update over three day with my older style of ac outlet switch before writing many rule plug in your wemo and wait a few day for all the firmware upgrade the last firmware update rendered my wemo app rule unusable the ifttt recipe continued to work i wa told the remote access being enabled to use ifttt during firmware update caused the problem be sure to turn off remote access when doing firmware update to keep your rule intact,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
worst product ever unintuitive and unreliable,1.0,wemo switch is perhaps the worst product i have ever used in my life i say this because i am usually very patient with technology and can be quite persistent when connecting thing to other thing but wemo switch wa able to exhaust me out to receive such a bad rating i wonder how this ha over 6k review anyways so the reason why this smart plug suck is because of the following reason 1 extremely convoluted setup process requiring you to first connect to wemo wifi then head over to wemo app to connect to your home wifi it sound simple but it s not intuitive whoever design this need to review this process and compare to other similar product and why they are so much more intuitive 2 when trying to install the switch first time and on subsequent restore attempt my iphone android another iphone could not connect to the wemo wifi it show up in the list of network but always fails to connect i must have done the restore process at least 75 time over 4 different occasion same result this is what frustrated me the most 3 i have to say that the switch did work when i wa able to complete the setup only to keep dropping the internet every few day requiring me to go through the grueling and useless process of restore see 2 above so today after once again spending an hour trying to restore and failing to complete the setup i decided to give up on this product i cannot recommend this product to anyone if you want to maintain your sanity please look at alternative a i am about to do,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

completely unusable on android do not buy updated,1.0,i ve updated this review in which i originally complained about the gaping security hole in belkin s wemo product they ve since closed those hole which is great and it would be even better if i could actually update the firmware on the device unfortunately that s not possible because the android app is one of the worst piece of software i ve laid hand on in year if and when it can manage to connect a switch to my wifi network just a few foot from the access point it then can t find it when it scan the network and yet somehow it can tell me what the firmware version on the device is but is there any way to upgrade it from that screen no the ui is sluggish and constantly freeze at detecting device which it is unable to do belkin failed to publish detail an api to allow other apps to control the device and their own software a usual is complete garbage it s a wonder how these people stay in business i got the two wemo switch device despite a longstanding no belkin policy because they were at a fire sale price and i needed one for a really inconveniently placed air conditioner now despite the dirt cheap price i m stuck with useless junk due to belkin s incompetence i ll know better next time,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo switch smart plug wifi,3.0,decent smart plug setup is easy a big drawback to me is that it stay off after a power outage there is no setting that will allow you to change this default behavior this mean you have to check the app periodically to see if the plug is on if it is not you can manually send the on command i cannot find anyway to change the default from off to on or previous state some other brand of smart plug allow you to set the plug to return to the state it wa in when the power went off i did find that i can use ifttt to automatically send me an e mail if it sens the plug is off,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

wifi connectivity spotty,3.0,i bought one of these 3 month ago from another store that offered a rebate setup is pretty easy setting up on off rule is pretty easy too seems flexible enough for my usage being able to override the timed behavior from within my home is really useful i bought this more because i wanted a remote control switch and le because i wanted a timed switch and this worked pretty well for a while as a minor nit the app ha one button push on push off and there s a delay from when you hit the button to when it update status it would be much easier to use if there wa an on button and a separate off button then i could just hit the button and not have to monitor to see if it actually did what i requested it s been a couple of month now recently when i bring up the wemo app it claim it can t detect the wemo switch and if it can t detect the presence of the wemo switch i can t override the behavior i think it still work reliably a a timed switch but quite unreliably a a remote control switch oh another minor nit the ability to remotely control the wemo switch when my phone is not connected to my wifi ha always been unreliable there s a config choice of whether to allow access when phone is remote and it s set to allow it yet it s unreliable,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

easy to use and work great with alexa,5.0,i bought this a a part of my home automation upgrade i connect my lamp to the wemo switch and pair it with the amazon echo if you are not interested in color changing or dimmable lighting this is way cheaper than the philips hue kit it is also much more easier and convenient to use than hue bulb the pairing process take a few minute but it is straight forward it come with very clear instruction and the app is also easy to use pairing with alexa need a few extra step but it work perfectly the good thing is that there is always a physical button to turn it off when you don t have wifi,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
very happy for performance and price,5.0,what i love free and easy set up via wemo app integrated with amazon echo flawlessly doe not require a add on hub of any sort and for all of the smart tech that is out there this is on the more affordable end of thing that said only drawback is the size can t use in weather protected outdoor box and if using a part of a power switch better have a transformer slot or this will block slot on both side rendering power strip inefficient that said can t knock off any star because of price i can buy two of these for 1 of the in wall style which all require a 50 hub to be added pas on that until the tech improves this is the model to go for,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great product crappy software control,3.0,this thing is awesome the device itself function flawlessly the supporting software at least the android version suck it s slow it s clunky and it s cumbersome i got around that by hacking together a couple of script that allow me to turn it on and off through a simple command typed on my computer i doubt that my solution is going to be the same solution most people pick it would be nice if they would improve their app and introduce a web app that you could utilize easily from any web browser either way i ve got two and i ll probably buy a few more,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
so far i really like this device,5.0,so far i really like this device it wa fairly simple to set up and install product instruction could have been a little better especially to tie in with amazon alexa but wa able to figure it out once i installed the app on my phone the system did two firmware update at first i didn t think it wa going to work on my phone but i did a restart on my phone and everything fell into place note if you change the name of the device from wemo to say living room you will need to go back into the echo setup and have it refind the new name overall so far i really like the device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
looks like it want a pefect outlet,3.0,not sure how to be fair it seems to work although the app is not a user friendly a far a menu option etc i could not get the darn thing to be seen on the network in the app my secure wifi network the wemo network always said out of range the issue i found out when i finally got it to show on the network 100 of the time wa if i put it in a pefectly working 3 pronged outlet it wa on a power strip by apc i put it in a two pronged outlet with the wide blade for grounding by using a two to three pronged adapter this i thought wa acceptable since it did not match the 3 pronged wemo w o intervention so be it yet it did not work in other 3 pronged outlet they must be too old or unsure because it wa tried on the power strip and voila it work now i am not sure why the others are not ok since they have been working fine on appliance with three plug had not yet tried to put a tester or strip or ups that ha a circuit tester to see if the older outlet are not perfect seems odd though,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
received the switch plug yesterday and installation wa very easy i have my christmas tree plugged in to,1.0,update it s been nearly a year and i m frustrated about 2 month ago i wa having issue getting the device to respond i searched all over the internet and found a way to reset it it worked after a few attempt but it ha since failed again the device will not connect to the internet i m not sure what i ll do next but at this point the device is worthless to me i received the switch plug yesterday and installation wa very easy i have my christmas tree plugged in to it and enjoy asking alexa to turn it on and off i have a dark house and end up tripping over the animal and myself trying to turn the light on when i get home i look forward to siting the tree in so when i arrive it ll not only be lively but light my way i m planning to buy more the one thing i dislike is the size it take up quite a bit of the outlet space,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
nice switch working good so far,5.0,i purchased this switch to work with my echo spot so far the two have been working flawlessly to bring an additional level of coolness to the man cave i thought the switch wa a little big when i first saw it but had no issue fitting it where i wanted it to go the set up is easy if you follow the instruction provided i recommend you look at a couple of online video if you have any doubt i loved this product so much i purchased a wemo light switch that also work great with my echo spot i did not purchase any of the listed product from amazon because i wanted them yesterday and wa able to find them locally if i ever need another switch i will definitely purchase another wemo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not recommended device,2.0,device work with verbal order to echo once it is programed to do so but echo cannot address the switch after a 115 volt loss of power to the house wiring you cannot be assured that of device s functioning reliably in use and requires resetting to returning to desired function with a power interrupt to get function you have to push button on wemo after a power loss but that doesn t reset the remote function a mechanical control function to operate the remote device echo function ok after a power outage why not this simple switch not recommended device,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
cheap and easy way to remotely control any electronic device,4.0,i love this device and think this is an inexpensive way to remotely control light what have you from anywhere in the world the only part i don t like is the fact that this partially block my power outlet a in the attached picture factors affecting my decision only work with 2 4 ghz this actually is fine just mentioning all factor bulky size sometimes there is a delay in responding to when i press the button on my iphone to when the device actually turn on the quick release of better product from belkin wemo immediately after i purchased this,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the app is almost broken no instruction can t find my ap an expensive unconnected switch,1.0,maybe it work if you have a few hour to try to get it configured the android app will freeze it won t let me change anything i tried one ap which it refused to access but i couldn t try a second until i did a clear data under the app manager at least i know how i got a frozen unresponsive blank connected to id screen more than once it doesn t give progress it just ha the spinner and will ignore anything except the home screen and it keep going failed in the background you have to set it a the ap so your android will want to connect to it not the real ap it just give me the choice of try again or later when it can t connect to the ap i have no problem connecting to with every other device it ha one instruction card with a bunch of confusing icon nothing about how to choose an ap they need to completely rewrite and fix the android app for this to even be partially useful maybe the power switch will work but if i can t get it connected any non techie will just be lost and there is no 800 support number,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
this is yuuge,4.0,as a proud owner of 2 tp link smart plug i wa hesitant to try a different brand née ecosystem my hesitation are null a the wemo switch smart plug wa an easy setup both via the wemo app and connecting to my echo the entire process basically took 5 minute the wemo app seemed more streamlined than tp link s kasa and is more pleasing to the eye but otherwise setup wa similar my only real dislike is the size of the thing which is clearly pictured when you actually look at all the product photo hey it wa on sale via alexa so i could care le if both of them were on sale i would get the tp link just cuz i like the size and shape better overall a really great product and if you have an echo you should order it right now,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
after a trickier than expected set up it is working well would recommend,4.0,a trifle harder trickier to set up than i had anticipated but once done it ha worked flawlessly not sure exactly what made the set up so tricky but suspect it wa the use open wi fi automatically switch being on to be fair they do point to this a a potential problem albeit using older setting language than i wa seeing on my nexus 5x anyway it s up and running and working a advertised we had no problem getting alexa to recognize it and it ha slipped into our smart home set up flawlessly having got one up and running i would now gladly buy more when the time come,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
automation rule won t work,3.0,the wemo switch itself seems to work fine but for me the only reason to have it is to apply automated rule to it if all i can do it turn it on off from my phone i might a well turn on the lamp with a switch the wemo app i use the android version is supposed to let you set up automated rule to turn it on off but doesn t work i ve been trying for week and others on the forum have also if they ever get the app to work properly it would be a great product however i have been able to program ifttt to activate the switch so that is why i can give it 3 star,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great idea but still seeking applications,3.0,well designed and expertly packaged the instruction were both easy to follow and witty however several application could not be successfully engaged one wa our harmony tv remote system which work flawlessly but will not work with our wemo smart plug no matter how carefully we follow the instruction other item are also seemingly incompatible if they have an on off switch that re set when power isn t detected thus far it is relegated to simply turning on a light that le sophisticated and le costly component can do just a well,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
honestly it s cheap trash,1.0,i ve had the wemo switch for about 6 month now and it s broken more than it work it is cool that you can use your voice and alexa to turn it on sometimes but that s the extent of it usefulness we bought it for a hard to reach outlet that we keep our lamp plugged into never ever ever update the firmware if by some miracle you actually get the switch to work do not update it it won t work anymore after that i ve not listened to my own advice twice now and have spent probably 3 hour trying to fix the stupid switch it s not worth the hassle nor the price tag,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it s been working for over 6 month now,4.0,this wa the first thing that i ordered through my alexa when it went on special so i m not sure why it isn t showing a a verified purchase it wasn t hard to set up on my phone i m using it to operate a floor lamp that is behind a large birdcage and difficult to access that light get turned on off at least four time a day once the app wa set up on the phone it wa fairly easy to connect it to alexa it ha lost connection a few time usually it just requires a reset on the outlet device it s ok and it doe the job 3 1 2 stars,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

bought this smart plug on the lighting deal sale on amazon for,5.0,bought this smart plug on the lighting deal sale on amazon for 20 this plug work very well with the app you can turn on and off the light using the app set timer etc but the best part is it work with our google home device so all we need to tell google home is light please and she complies it is great to control all the light in the house with just your voice you can have multiple plug in different room and control them individually through the app and google home a great gift for a tech lover or just someone who forgets to turn the light off while on vacation,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

i enjoy the functionality,4.0,i bought two of these a an accessory for my amazon dot the setup wa simple and i enjoy the functionality i appreciate that this switch work without a bridge or hub can be controlled by voice through alexa manually with a button on the unit or via a phone app i even have one set to automatically turn a light on at sunset and off at bedtime the only negative is the size a it partially obstructs the second outlet in a duplex wall outlet my house wa built in the 1950 s so they weren t expecting the volume of thing we d have plugged into the wall in the 21st century,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

automate life,5.0,i ve wemo d my house and i don t regret it my spouse like the house cold while i like it warm at night we have the ceiling fan going and i tuck myself under the cover when i wake up i like to lay in bed for a little while but the problem is the fan is going full blast and my eye dry out now i have to get out of bed to turn the fan off which ruin my easy going wake up schedule thats when i found that wemo ha the capability to turn device on off using a smart phone i could turn off the fan when i wake up using my phone i installed it to the light switch and discovered there is a scheduling feature which made it even more convenient i have the fan automatically turn on before we go to bed and turn off at the time my spouse wake up this wa the start of my wemo addiction note the product i used for the ceiling fan wa wemo light switch not wemo smart plug since then i ve been looking for excuse to justifying wemos for my house added another wemo to the bedroom fan to control the light because might a well have the capability to contron both light and fan had a baby last year and on many occasion dealt with the extremely fussy infant that would finally fell asleep in my arm the room would get a little warm and need the fan turned on and light off but standing up to turn on the switch mean waking the baby installed two wemo light switches to solve that wemo team there a great commercial idea for you guy my spouse well maybe it wa me would leave the ceiling fan on in an unoccupied room over night i set up a rule to turn the fan off automatically at 1 00am to save electricity installed another wemo light switch in another room where the window face the street went on vacation and enabled the away mode to make it appear someone wa in the house now for the smart plug i ve turned the christmas tree on at sunset and off at 10 30 my spouse ha these electric scented wax melt that turn on and off according to a wemo programmed schedule i would say to take precaution and evaluate any risk associated with having wemo apply power to a potientally unattended device that purposefully generates heat i ve successfully connected my amazon echo dot to the wemos alexa turn off the living room light and they turn off i wa thinking about buying some wemos a gift for some elder family member who have mobility issue i also have the wemo insight smart plug and specifically bought it because it can monitor energy consumption i thought it would be a solution to monitor when my washing machine ha stopped using electricity it would remind me to move my clothes over to the dryer but wemos currenly do not have that functionality plus i dont know if it make sense to add that functionality in my case i would not use it to turn on off the power it would be on 24 7 but just to monitor power consumption and report when it stopped in total i have 5 wemo light switches 3 wemo smart plugs 1 wemo insight smart plug,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

good working product,4.0,pretty awesome it work a intended and is pretty easy to set up with the amazon echo pros it work a intended functions natively with amazon echo has a manual on off button allows me to yell at alexa to turn on the nightlight in stead of my girlfriend cons it s kinda big and unwieldy not huge but it s really only suited for the top slot of a wall outlet tried to fit it on a power strip and it would have blocked off 3 slot the connection with the phone wa a tad awkward required me to change some phone setting switch over to it separate wifi then put in my main wifi password other smart device that i own didn t require that not a huge deal and it s doable in under 5 minute but still a bit annoying i can see how a non techy might have a bit of trouble with it overall still a really good product my girlfriend approves,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

works great,5.0,works great love this little wifi outlet works great with alexa and very easy to manage the only recommendation i d give is why not include a couple usb port on these outlet if they are smart outlet then they should get with the time and include usb outlet like how many of the dumb outlet are including nowadays,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

the product work wonderful still,4.0,setting this thing up and all other wemo device are a huge pain out of the box you first have to connect a cell phone to the wemo that is never a problem then the wemo connects to the wifi that s a huge problem i have one switch plug and two wemo light switches and they all had issue connecting to the wifi keeps saying it can t connect to wifi wemo support said to me that it s my wifi yeah right everything else in the house ha wifi that work wemo support tell me that the wemo device is too far away from the wifi modem yeah right i have a wemo light switch that is le than ten foot away from the wifi modem and it still can t connect i had to do a factory reset on all my wemo s several time and then try to connect over and over eventually it like it that s my only complaint after the setup fiasco the product work wonderful still i plan to purchase more wemo device for the rest of my house but i already know that i will have so much stress setting these darn thing up,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works well but requires a little thinking up front,4.0,firstly i am reviewing a uk 3pin 230v ac version i have had this switch about a week now and so far so good i have this a a trial to see if it is worth getting more of these switch to further automate my home initial impression when getting the unit out of the box is that it is a little large there are several of these type of device on the market now and even people building the wifi capability into the socket itself so it must be possible to bring the form factor down a bit that said it is more than possible to get 2 unit side by side in a 2 gang socket however head clearance or protrusion from the wall could be an issue with some installation behind tv unit for example setup wa quite straight forward using the wemo app on my phone i liked the way that it could port through my wifi info once i wa connected to the device directly this is make the configuration quick and easy i have not experienced any drop out at any time via a bt smart hub so that appears to be quite good a well i am running alexa echo dot in the house also and when trying to bind the 2 i did encounter a few issue firstly the wemo guide will tell you to add the wemo skill to alexa we dont have this skill in the uk skill store so that s not going to happen all the installation guide for the wemo equipment from there web site are for the us market to the extent that they even show all 2pin plug not 3pin uk plug a little playing with alexa and i found that i could search and bind to the wemo directly without the need for a specific skill this work fine however i did also find then that if you rename the device using the wemo app i had to do this a alexa did not get on with the word booth and kept looking for bluetooth you have to delete from alexa and re learn a a new device once working on with alexa i have routine running now on younomi to switch on a i return home etc all in impressed so far however a little more up to date support and guide from wemo and a reduction in form factor and this would have been a 5 star review,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works a advertised if you can get through the setup,3.0,seems to work fine it function is very simple but setup wa a major pain using current ios and wemo version had to reset the wemo switch multiple time to keep it broadcasting it wifi ssid long enough to get through the ios wemo app without wemo s wifi timing out then after i had this happen i had to uninstall and re download install the wemo app to try connecting again took almost one hour for the whole thing to work properly and the wemo app never told me that the connection to my home network wa complete i had to terminate the wemo app and restart it to see that thing were working properly,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i wantedi to love this i really did,2.0,i wantedi to love this i really did i do love the idea of being able to automate thing in my home the promise of being able to use a name brand product belkin to use it on pretty much any appliance light i wanted being able to control them all from one app on my phone or watch and the ability to integrate with ifttt all sounded wonderful and when it work it is i had one connected to lamp in the living room a space heater in the bedroom and a steamer that my wife hated to have to walk to the other side of the house in the morning to turn on using ifttt interface you can create recipe that do thing like turn on the garage light i also bought a wall switch for there when you approach the house or turn on the light in the living room at dusk or turn on the steamer when you wake up like i say sound great right the problem a others have said is that the firmware and tech support for these device are not up to par i have spent many hour trying to do thing like updating the firmware on the device getting my wifi to recognize the device again and dealing with the frequent interuptions in service seemingly any time there s a glitch in the wifi system and sometimes for no apparent reason the app can no longer recognize the device i ve programmed in and i m off line until i can find the time to re do the process when it doe work it s golden a i say but the headache associated with keeping it working have resulted in four device that are simply more trouble than they are of use for the last few week i haven t even bothered with them and am pretty well done with the belkin wemo experience too bad and once i m over my disappointment i ll probably research other possibility,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

buggy performance at a premium price,3.0,bought this to control some accent lighting in my loft that wa only reachable by ladder and didn t have a wired switch first tried one of those rf switchable outlet that claimed 50 range but ultimately maxed out at le than 3 foot ridiculous i know i read the mixed review on this unit but i wanted something that worked off wifi so there wouldn t be range issue i only installed this today but it took quite a bit to get it set up setup wasn t bad but at some point the switch lost connection to the router it wa attempting to install a firmware so that might have had something to do with it additionally this doe not seem to work with 5ghz n network which is annoying my phone and other device in the house are all on the 5ghz band where my wemo and similarly my quirky aros ac are limited to the 2 4ghz band luckily belkin ha remote access built into these thing so it doesn t matter what network you are connected to although i wonder if that creates momentary delay anyhow after getting back into the loft and resetting the switch a few time it finally seems to be consistently connected i ll have to keep my eye on it over the next few day and report back if i have any additional problem good news is that my range issue is negated but for 50 i would have hoped it would support 5ghz band and be a bit more stable at setup,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
it s all about proximity,3.0,if the unit is close enough to the wireless router it stay connected and online no problem if there is the slightest bump in the signal it go offline and is almost impossible to bring back without resetting the unit again and again i had it upstairs from my belkin router and on the 300bm medium channel but it wa not able to stay online and i ended up having to reset it three time in 6 hour three name and reset later i gave up on the upstairs light and moved it to one on the same floor a the router and no problem since both the app and amazon echo are turning it on and off regularly with no problem a stronger antenna in the unit might solve the issue although to be fair that part of the house is lousy with my phone and computer too all in all work well if it can stay online,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

really getting tired of this thing,1.0,okay so i changed my wi fi setup and had to set the wemo up again it wa relatively bulletproof once it wa setup but the set up itself is always a nightmare first you go looking for the user guide online oh the link go to an invalid page great 30 minute of searching and i finally found a poorly written guide okay great hold the reset button while you plug it in and continue to hold it for a few second yup flashing orange great factory setting jump on that wi fi run the app give the wemo a name have it search for wi fi network doesn t find my home network which it is sitting 6 foot from okay plug in a power cable and put it on the desk 6 inch from the ap try again yup find the network now says it joining that network and nothing app doesn t find it unplug it plug it back in blue wi fi light go on and then after a short time it go out again reset to factory default again try again and again give up toss it in the trash look for an alternative,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works if you can get past setup,3.0,ok so i purchased this from best buy in case it broke i could return it the same day here s there rundown it work well if you can get past the initial setup i have a nexus 6p which would never work with the app i thought it might be a marsh mellow issue but it appears to be a hardware phone issue i ran it on my oneplusone with android m and it worked so if you get the app to load and setup on another phone you can control it from another phone because it will discover it already setup this is an android issue and the app ha a 2 7 out of 5 rating so that should tell you something otherwise it work fine,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great with the amazon echo,5.0,we used this to control our christmas tree light with the amazon echo simple set up and work great after the holiday we hooked it up to a color changing light in my daughter room and changed the name of it to party so now you can ask alexa to turn the party on and the disco light come on she love it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
when it work it great however,3.0,when it work it great however if the device loses wifi connectivity the on off action will not occur they appear to be pushed from the cloud not cached on the device waking up to find the coffee machine ha not warmed up wa not a highlight firmware update are problematic most update result in the wemo plug losing connectivity i have had to hard power off on in many case and in some reset the device and reconfigure it to get it to work again most firmware update report upgrade failed and take repeated attempt earlier firmware really really struggled to connect to a wireless network the newer one seem to be better however this can take repeated attempt lasting minute once bound it seems to stick for at least a period of time the connection periodically seem to go stale and i have to either power off all the wemo switch or force kick them off the access point firmware update will turn off power during a set program and not restore it the on off behaviour is essentially not state managed at all but rather relies on single one off timed trigger a state managed option to say i want this to be on between these time make a lot more sense than hey let try once and only once to turn this thing on at x o clock app interface is pretty clumsy,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
in general i cannot recommend a it too unreliable for everyday use,1.0,does not hold solid connection with wifi despite being only 10 foot away from the access point setup wa time consuming device lost connection after update required complete factory reset of the device deleting and reloading the app and complete reconfiguration when it is operational there is a delay between clicking the button on the app or asking alexa to turn light off to when light actually go off in general i cannot recommend a it too unreliable for everyday use,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
single network use only,4.0,i bought two of these thinking that if i liked how they work i d buy several more i planned to use them at my work and at home they were pretty easy to set up and worked great at home i took one to work and did a reset to let me reprogram it for my company s wifi quickly and easily added it but then discovered the switch that wa at home no longer showed up on my app a little research online get me to belkin s faq and there it is no you can not use the device on multiple wifi network if you have multiple device on multiple network you have to have a separate device hosting the app for each network this isn t a major issue but doe seem like room for improvement or upgrade update 05 19 2014 have bought more wemo device light switch receptacle the android app is disappointing doesn t see all my device rule do not show up more often than not,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

simple and yet seriously cool,5.0,i ve been debating and considering smart home device for some time with most of my energy directed to samsung smartthings looks cool but it also appears to be non trivial investment the wemo smart plug wa a impulse purchase and i m delighted it work well i used an ipad not an iphone to set it up easy and then asked my amazon alexa to discover appliance and just like that i have voice control over my living room light feels seriously cool and it wa so easy,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
does not fully work with hidden ssid making it useless after power cycle,1.0,two issue the setup program will not allow to enter a hidden ssid i have to log into my router and unhide it in order for the wemo outlet to see it it will work okay but if i rehide my network the wemo switch won t see the network anymore after a power cycle it s hard to understand why belkin designed it this way none of my other wifi device act this way they all can handle being unplugged and see the hidden network right away after electricity is restored unfortunately this product doesn t seem to be designed properly so i give it my lowest rating,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
we love our wemos,5.0,love it we have them all over the house paired with our tap and echo device it s so nice to be able to ask alexa to turn on the light in a dark room or to have her turn it off by request and the timer option are great because instead of having to schedule on and off time with those old school timer you can quickly and easily set up either specific time or have the wemo go on and off randomly during any period of time you want on your phone definitely worth it,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
can t quite put a finger on the issue or describe,4.0,can t quite put a finger on the issue or describe my feeling that this product just need a bit more maturity especially when controlled with an echo dot i d also really be interested in version with small built in ups one version could just have a small battery to keep itself powered long enough to tell alexa that it ha lost power another version could have enough ups to run reasonable device for a few minute so that alexa could perform a graceful shut down,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great plug,4.0,we love these switch we currently have one of these wemo plug unit a well a a tplink one and a few of the light switch wemo one i havent noticed a huge difference between the different brand and will just continue to buy whichever is cheaper at the time i need them they work very well with alexa and do a great job helping to make our home a lot smarter we especially like the away feature where it will turn on and off randomly to mimic u being home i would recommend them to anyone,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
wemo saved my life more than once,5.0,okay so i m sort of new to the automation stuff i don t really want to invest ton of money to buy the high automation stuff especially when i can do it with wemo and alexa i m more of a diy guy so when i saw the wemo switch smart plug i had to try one well now i have 3 of them one for my tree spotlight in the front yard one to control the string of light on the mantle above the fireplace it also controlled the christmas tree when it wa up and i just bought one saturday because my wife said it would be nice to have her lamp turn on automatically i just got an echo dot that we have ton of fun with alexa work well with wemo i live on a hill and have a steep driveway so i heated it i use the wemo switch to control my snow melt system what a lifesaver that ha been i don t fall and slide to the bottom of the driveway anymore i used to have to call my daughter who life a couple mile away to go and turn on the driveway so it would be clear when i got home from work now i can just do it from my wemo app on my phone i will be adding other wemo smart plugs a i think of more thing i want to do to make life easier,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
all and all a good purchase,4.0,i just bought this switch in order to control an array of light that i have in my living room generally speaking this switch is working a it should and i would say even better than the wemo lights product i also bought in an effort to enlighten potential buyer i have scrambled below a list of fact regarding this product 1 the android application need to be revisited by the developer it is very very slow and extremely buggy 2 you need to have a solid router that can handle the constant i o between the device and the internet my tp link 1043nd needed daily restarts so i decided to change that a well as a rule of thumb a good 1900ac router is more than capable to handle the traffic 3 if you have an android phone you only need the device and an ifttt profile in order to be in the position to issue voice command to the device no need for anything extra like google home or even amazon echo 4 the size of the device is quite substantial thus using this in a tight spaced power strip is a no go at least without rendering useless more than one slot all and all i would buy this product again or if you feel adventurous you can have a look at wemo maker,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
not my first choice but,5.0,wemo smart switch wa not my first choice but it should have been actually i am glad that i bought a competitive product first because it give me a point of comparison trying to set up the other brand wa a nightmare connecting to my network just did not happen when i awakened from my bad dream i immediately bought the wemo there were a few minor problem with setting up the wemo all resulted from my error when i followed the direction everything went smoothly the wemo smart switch wa purchased to work with my echo dot connecting the two device wa a snap and everything is working just a it should would i buy this product again yes i would in fact i just bought a second wemo like the first it is working quite nicely and i discovered that when you follow the instruction setup is a snap,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
christmas wa saved,5.0,this wa the perfect solution this christmas to my son hiding the remote control for our christmas tree that started to infuriate me so i chose to pick up the wemo switch when amazon ha the amazing alexa deal this saved christmas easy to turn on and off using the amazon echo linked to all the other light in my house turns on on command and off on command perfect and best of all no more hidden remote for the previous solution i had for my christmas tree light,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
great product with a finicky setup,4.0,this product is the answer to every difficult to program light timer you ve ever had once it is setup you can set your light or anything else you may plug into the outlet with your phone you can even set it to go from dusk to dawn and depending on your timezone it will adjust nightly to when that time is it s a fantastic option you can also simply control the switch from your phone turn on your inside light before you get in the house turn them off when you go to bed it is massively convenient and the app is easy to use on iphone the bad part is the setup it took me about 35 minute to get the product working right the process seemed like it should have taken le than five when it first setup it did not automatically download the newest firmware i had to reset the entire system and reinstall the app for that to happen when it did finally download it did it very slowly i sense le technically inclined people may have given up earlier but if you stick with it you have a great product that doe what few item on the market can especially at this price point,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
i won t buy another,1.0,this switch would not work with echo i tried downloading the skill downloading the app and following the instruction to the letter nothing echo claimed it could find no device switch claimed it couldn t connect to the network maybe i had something set wrong but since there are no instruction except a cryptic quick set up and no help offered it went back to amazon if they want people to sign on to this home control future someone need to do a better job at making a plug and go interface,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

don t go wemo cause wemo don t go,1.0,i have used belkin product for many decade all the old product were superb i bought this switch at a big box store for a simple application what a disaster i checked out the online discussion board because you can t tell belkin your problem it seems that belkin is no9t the company it used to be the product firmware is riddled with bug the device may or may not connect after a power failure belkin posted a solution to that problem put your router on a wemo switch and if the device don t connect after a power failure cycle the power to the router that is pretty tricky because if you shut off your router remotely using the wemo you will never be able to access the swith again because your network is gone another simple minded problem easily fixed but not fixed the wemo switch doe not remember it s state after a power failure it always come up off anybody who ha even minimal technical capability know how ridiculous this is even their own product year back ip controlled receptacle restored their state after a power failure i read a lot of review before buying many people say how great the product is so i discounted the bad review big mistake the good review were probably written within day after buying and before experiencing a power failure the long term robust standard for home control is z wave it is even used by commercial security company there are many controller that support z wave including wink i highly recommend going with z wave device and forget about wemo,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

disappointment terrible wifi performance,1.0,bought this smart plug for a simple use of turning a light on and off from a smartphone unfortunately i couldn t get it to reliably work a it wouldn t consistently connect to my wifi network i m an electronics enthusiast and network administrator and tried everything eventually i narrowed down the problem a being with the device itself having extremely poor wifi range and performance it would only connect to my network when it wa within about 6m 20ft direct line of sight of my router and even then it wouldn t stay connected reliably outside that range or with any wall etc between it and it wouldn t connect at all after searching online it seems that many other people are experiencing poor wifi connectivity with their switch and that it seems to have been made much worse after a recent firmware update taking it back to the store for a refund asap really disappointing belkin i liked the sound of what you were offering and it s integration to other service but this is not a working reliable product,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

i did love the ease at which one could connect with the,2.0,i did love the ease with which one could connect with the app however i find changing the setting a bit cumbersome one ha to start over and delete a prior setting in order to change the time setting for example if i had a setting for one hour at 5 30 am and i wanted to come back and change it to 515 i d have to delete the original setting and then go back in and do a new setting there is no easy way to change once you have something set up all they need to do is change the app,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
works great with easy set up,5.0,this is exactly what i wa looking for and it work great i wanted a wifi switch i could control my light not only when i am away from home but also when i arrive the room light are located in awkward part of the room and at night in the dark it is hard to maneuver around the room having the ability to switch on the light even when i am leaving from an engagement and headed home eliminates the problem of busted knee it also integrates with the ring doorbell camera system if my ring doorbell or motion sensor go off and i am not home there is quick access to the wemo app within the ring app which allows me to activate my light with no hassle lights go one person at the door or lurking around the house think someone is home easy to set up and work like a charm,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
fatal flaw if you plan to use this in an out of the way place,2.0,this worked great until we lost power for a minute last week no big deal if all i had to do wa walk over and push the button to re pair it however since i wa using this to control a pump in our attic i had to go up there to do it and my wife won t do this when i am away tp link doesn t have this problem though i do terribly miss the auto off function that is in the wemo sottware,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
simple the best,5.0,look there s 101 different smart plug you can buy but by far this belkin wemo is the best why feature wise on par if not better than the rest but that s not where this plug excels it excels a no hub required with hive smart heating and arlo camera what i really really do not need is yet another hub to stick next to our router that s right this is a home so i don t want to be building a rack up for all this router hub purely to tidy thing up now not having a hub could be a bit rubbish if you couldn t connect this to service like ifttt simple app that let you set up if this then that command to get your smart product talking to one another thus my belkin wemo is used to turn on a floodlight if motion detected with one of my arlo camera works a treat and will be buying more to use for other thing like i said because you can use ifttt the possibility are endless,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
total control of lights,5.0,i received two of these a gift and love them way easier to use than the old style plug in with dial and little peg and easy to change to precise time of the day i use mine with my iphone i don t yet have amazon com s alexa but this will be in my future i found the wemo s relatively easy to program and i always know what the lighting situation is at home when i am traveling,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
to couch every where im sorry lol,5.0,i have to say sorry to my couch because omg the wemo switch ha to be one of the best thing i ve seen come from belkin for quite sometime this thing is a game changer i never have to get up again to cut off the light i wish i do the same for being thirsty lol ive forgotten many time to cut off the light in the living room and have been to lazy to get up so i just pull out my phone and with a quick touch click it off and im sound asleep the wemo switch is my best friend when im on the couch though and im sure my couch want a breather sometimes but with the conveniency of pairing it with alexa this make a simple take even simpler one thing that i wish could be fixed is that when it turn on and off it make a clicking noise that take the surprise factor away from me but other than that this is man s new best friend lol i recommend everyone try one i have to thank my friend often for this amazing gift,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
the dumbest person for buying a smart product,1.0,it s possible i m a total moron it would not be the first time but for a device that is self described a being being smart and so simple to install this is the worst even a moron on a good day ought to be able to install an app plug in a lamp and make a light bulb turn on not with this thing i am on my 3rd hour and still it either can t find the network or when it finally doe it tell me to turn on smart switch im using an android device or after all this then doesn t find itself on the network i mean seriously after spending 40 buck to turn on and off a light bulb and after this many hour with it not working i feel more dumb than smart for a advanced a we are with technology sometimes we are absolutely no where,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

wemo switch room for improvement,4.0,this is something people in the past have missed out on there s room for improvement though the first thing i want to address is the pairing with the app i m an ios user and i downloaded the app a i wa instructed to do the misery started when i opened the app the app crashed constantly and made the pairing very difficult the second problem with the pairing wa the pairing wifi network that didn t show up for a long time this wa another thing that made the pairing a problem but after this troubleshooting i finally got to enjoy the wonder of this smart plug i could eventually turn on my light with the push of a button i also purchased an amazon alexa which made the turning of part even easier now it wa voice controlled and i didn t even have to pull out my phone to turn of my light overall a great product but only when you are past the setting up part,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

taking rocket science away from automatic timer switch,5.0,i have bought three of these and several wall switch working together with two other traditional home automation brand and some other automatic timer wemo is by far the easier to use to program and to manage some home automation brand would require their special hardware like a hub before one can get beyond just a timer while a simple timer often require complex programming instruction without the original instruction those switch become just paper weight wemo switch are different they seem to remember their last setting even they are unplug plug them back in and they are ready to go,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

weak wifi receiver,3.0,i had a little trouble getting it paired up to my wifi it took multiple attempt of going through the setup process to get it to work i really liked the app interface it had some decent feature in the scheduling portion including a sunset to sunrise option ultimately i took it back because the wifi signal receiver wa pretty weak i had a fairly decent signal 2 out of 3 bar on my cell phone and the wemo switch had nothing so if you re not too far from your router this is a great product i would have liked to see wink app integration some how,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"
good but need better google home integration,4.0,i really enjoy this product it is easy to setup and very reliable my only complaint would be that the google home integration should really be improved while i do have a bunch of wemo switch hooked up to my google home through ifttt the process for integrating wemo with ifttt and then programming ifttt to work with google home wa tedious and un maintable bellini should really improve this if they want to claim they have integration with google home other than that the product work really well very reliable easy to use doe what it say etc,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

connectivity issue ended up going with insteon starter kit instead,1.0,for starter i m an it professional i ve been working with computer and network for 18 year i have an older home but i ve been wanting to dip my toe into home automation i figured the belkin wemo switch would be a good start i purchased two of the switch at best buy for 50 each and brought them home i plugged them in downloaded the wemo app on my iphone 5 running ios 7 and switched over to the wi fi network created by the switch i proceeded to enter in my home wi fi network credential for the 2 4 ghz band and then i updated the firmware on the switch per the prompt the firmware update took a few minute and then the wemo rebooted on it own as an aside i have two airport extreme router one extending the range of the other i have my router set up for 2 4 ghz a b and g and 5 ghz n band but the wemo is not compatible with 5 ghz when belkin say it s not compatible with 5 ghz they re not kidding i ve interacted with other device cross band on my wi fi network before with no problem but somehow belkin ha engineered a product that cannot be interacted with from a smartphone that s technically within the same network but is running on the 5 ghz band so i had to forget the 5 ghz network on my iphone and join the 2 4 ghz network in order to interact with the wemo over wi fi with my iphone 5 on the 2 4 ghz band and the wemo also on the 2 4 ghz band i launched the wemo app again tapped the on button for the switch and the light attached to the switch came on neat i tapped the button again to turn the light off and the light stayed on hmmm not good i closed the app entirely on my iphone and went back in and now the power button for the switch wa grayed out on my screen i figured power cycling the wemo would fix this so i unplugged it waited a few second and then plugged it back in this time i wa able to turn the light off but when i went to turn it back on a few second later nothing happened the wemo had seemingly lost wi fi connectivity again thinking a reset of the wemo would fix this issue i reset it connected to it own wi fi network again and reconfigured it to join my 2 4 ghz wi fi network after completing the setup again i had the same result the wemo would stay connected long enough for me to interact with the switch immediately but then it dropped the connection keep in mind that all the other 2 4 ghz device in my home had full signal strength when sitting directly in front of the wemo so signal strength wa not the problem maybe i just got a bad unit but it left a bad enough taste in my mouth that i didn t even bother opening the second wemo switch i d purchased i took them both back to best buy and exchanged them for the insteon starter kit i brought that kit home and within 25 minute i had the ios app downloaded the insteon hub hooked up to my router and talking to both my 2 4 and 5 ghz network and the two included dimmer switch fully operational both inside and outside my network if you re looking to dip your toe into home automation a little bit at a time like i am do yourself a favor and read up on the insteon system for only 20 more than two of these wemo switch you get two dimmer switch and the insteon hub the dimming is optional by the way you can just use them in either off or full on mode but being able to also dim a light is a nice touch the dimming even work with the energy saving curly cue bulb the insteon system simply ha a lot more expandability for the long term than this wemo system from belkin and in my experience the insteon system is much easier to set up and is much more reliable than the wemo system,"WeMo Switch Smart Plug, Wi-Fi, Works with Amazon Alexa"

setup is nearly impossible,1.0,this smart plug is not very smart every other smart product i have used ha allowed one to establish automation rule with triggering condition where a basic action on the device such a turning it on or turning it off is a valid triggering condition not so on this device so for example if you wanted to set a rule of when this smart plug is turned off also turn off my other dlink device or when this smart plug is turned on turn it off 10 minute later to conserve elecricity you cannot on top of that setup wa unreliable i had to perform every single step at least twice to get it to work and some step never succeeded my modern smartphone wa unable to successfully perform the first step scanning the qr code on the device the qr code wa not only tiny but the ink wa smeared such that my phone wa unable to interpret it manual setup without the qr code requires you to know what hardware version you have there is no hardware version label on the device so you have to look for any random letter number combination on the back of the device to see if any of those match the hardware version choice you are presented with in the setup app one step requires you to enter a pin it failed to accept the pin and i had to kill the setup app restart the smart plug unplug it and re plug it and only after all of that did it accept the pin not to mention that the pin is on the back of the device which you cannot see when the plug is plugged into the wall overall the setup experience wa frustrating at best if you do decide to purchase this device take a photo of the backside you ll need several bit of information such a the device pin during setup all of which you will be unable to see when the device is plugged into the wall,"D-Link Smart Plug, Energy Monitoring, On/Off, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant (DSP-W215)"
