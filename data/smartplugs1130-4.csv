works great,5.0 ,"Works great, not sure why there negative reviews. One thing I did notice that I did not see in any documents is that you MUST connect to its wifi to setup. not your normal home one. just search for wifis on your phone, select it, and continue with the app. Love the ability to remotely shut down my 3d printer and computer","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Great Product - Highly Recommend,5.0 ,"If you have any electrical device that you want to turn on remote or while you are not at home, I highly recommend this product. As long as you have WiFi this product will make make your day more efficient by not having to worry about forgetting to turn on a device when you get homeor not being able to reach a difficult switch to power something. The HomeMate app is very useful and intuitive. This product is also highly suitable for the elderly especially if they have difficulties with mobility. I use to power my cat cameras so I can turn them on when I am at work to check in on them and then turn it off when I am done so I can save money on electricity bills. You can also use it for lights when you wake up in the morning and can’t find the light switch.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Awesome product at a great price!,5.0 ,"I rarely write reviews, but these are really fantastic! Inexpensive, work exactly as advertised, iPhone app is pretty impressive too. Nice to turn on all the decorations, salt lamp, etc with a single touch, or set the timer and they turn on/off at a schedule. Really well thought out product. Good job!","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
DOES Support Echo / Alexa,4.0 ,"Great smart plug. Easy installation and works right off the bat. It DOES support Echo and Alexa but does not support Google home which is a bit disappointing. I have both in my home. But if you only have Alexa, it works great.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
"Works great, save on energy costs",5.0 ,"Works fantastic! Easy 4 step setup. App is very intuitive. My kids leave the basement lights on all the time.

Very easy to set up,5.0 ,"Works very well, right out of the box. Very easy to set up, and I was pleasantly surprised that it worked from outside my wifi network.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Smart Plug,5.0 ,"Works as described. Very easy to use with app. I like this plug. More features given the affordable price. Worked first time out of the box. I can turn my bedroom light on while in bed, or at work. You can set timers, actions, or just a normal on/off switch. The actions are great because you can have the action work for an individual switch, multiple switches, or all switches. It is very reliable and maintains its wifi connection. Needs an app called ""HomeMate” in the App store for the iPhone and Google Play store for the Android. Download the app, register for an account and you are ready to start. Insert the Smart Plug into an outlet. In the app, click on add a device. Connect to device wifi, Press the button on the Smart Plug to make it flash and press next in the app. Enter your Wi-Fi and password in the app and press next. If everything is entered correctly, it should find your plug and show the name. You can rename the device at this time to something that makes sense for you. Click done in the app. You can now turn outlet on and off from the app. It works only with 2.5ghz band Wifi network and as really very low data transfer speed is all required. Lights can be scheduled to tun on or off while no one is at home. Also, I can turn on or turn off the lights through my cell phone from just about anywhere you travel with the App which is linked to these smart plugs. Really useful to control the floor lamp by using the phone apps.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Control Your House From Your Device,5.0 ,"I bought this in hopes to remind me not to work too long as an entrepreneur, I'm used to 6 AM - 2 AM work schedules. This now turns my light on when I need to wake up (All around my bed,) and turns off exactly at midnight, so I get some sleep. (Finally!) I've tried the timing task as shown in the video as a test, it's pretty neat, I've also tried to turn off the light from another room as a test, (in case I one day forget.) So this is a must keep for my lamps/lights! I love that it prevents overcharging, and cuts the power after the timer is over. It can have up to 20 devices to control the Wi-Fi socket, but I only use it for my bedroom lamps. It says it also can be used for fans, air-conditioning, charging, lights, coffee, etc. I personally like to get my coffee when I need it, not at a timed manner, but I might have to try that for the morning! The best part about it is the set up, it took literally less than 2 minutes for my lamp. 1.) You plug it in the socket, and you plug in the lamp into the Smart Socket 2.) You press the button on there until it blinks red, and press next or confirm on your phone (forgot what it said.) 3.) Connect to your home wifi, and... DONE! Oh yeah I forgot, you have to download an app called HomeMate, but that's no issue either. I'm in absolute love with this! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone for whatever your reason is ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
I got this smart plug to turn on/off TV power to my kid's ...,5.0 ,"This does exactly what I need it to. I got this smart plug to turn on/off TV power to my kid's room on a certain schedule. The app and setup was simple to do. The scheduling is exactly what I needed, I can see this used for many other things as well. I have it set to turn off the kids TV at 9pm and back on 4pm after school. Weekends I have it set to turn on 7am-10pm. Very convenient to control their TV time and if they're bad, I can just manually turn it off myself. Very cool gadget.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
it has been great worked and very fast,5.0 ,"I bought this WIFI Socket specifically to turn On my Gaming PC while I am away from my home. And so far, it has been great worked and very fast. I can control the socket via mobile data as long as the socket is connected to a WIFI. I have already used it to download a game update so when I came home the game was ready to play. This socket + Google remote Desktop= Paradise. Also, this socket powered my gaming PC through intensive gaming without a hiccup or a drop-in performance. My PC has an overclocked CPU with a GTX1070 a lot of peripherals and it did not crash once. I am very pleased with this socket.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
I decided to go with smart plugs for everything,5.0 ,"I decided to go with smart plugs for everything . Wroke great with Alex, sometimes you need to reconnect it to the network. these are my entry into the smart home world. Couldn't be more happy! Relatively inexpensive, easy to install and offer me a great deal more control over my home than I had before. I will certainly be ordering more in the future. absolutely no problems finding the app on iTunes and it only took about 3 minutes to set up (most of which was waiting for wifi to connect). The only downside I see is that when it turns on or off there is a fairly loud clicking noise but it's nothing that will wake up the neighbors and since it is only for a moment it really isn't that bad. We'll see how well it works in the longer run but as of right now it works great, and if I have any problems I'll be sure to update this review! Definitely would buy again. Pretty much works as described. You go through a straightforward process with your mobile phone to get the plug itself to be attached to your home's wifi. Make sure you know your wifi password before you start. Then turn it on or off via alexa or mobile phone.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
"Perfect, amazing smart plug!",5.0 ,"This smart plug is perfect. I have it set to automatically turn off the string lights in my room at night at 10 PM and to turn them back on in the morning at 6 AM. It was really easy to set up, just download the app (Homemate) and set up some timers and you're ready to go. I have had no issues with it whatsoever thoughout the past few months for which I have used it and it's been great. I also like that it has a physical on/off switch so that I can turn it off manually when I want to, though I must admit that it's so much more enjoyable to do it through my phone. I am highly considering and probably will buy more of these to automate various other lights in my house. I ready don't have anything negative to say about it. Except the app could be improved because apparently it has to log every automation that occurs, which accrues to unnecessary storage being used on my phone in the range of 100-150MB. Overall, though, I'm really satisfied with this smart plug!","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Perfect for voice control via Amazon Alexa,5.0 ,"This smart socket is perfect for voice control via Alexa. I really like using it for our bedroom light so we don't have to get out of bed to turn off the light. Please note this only works with an electrical outlet where you plug something in, not for a light controlled by a switch on the wall. I even hooked my other smart socket to my Scentsy warmer so I can tell it to turn on or off without having to find the little switch on the cable. Setup is easy with the Home Mate app. You must download and set up your device(s) through the Home Mate app first, and then add them to Alexa via the Amazon Alexa App. I ran into a little trouble getting Home Mate enabled on the Alexa App but the trick is to make sure you're signed into the Alexa App with your Home Mate credentials FIRST. I wasted a lot of time assuming enabling the Home Mate Smart Home skill for Alexa would be adequate but you need to sign in with your Home Mate credentials first.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Excellent Smart Plug,5.0 ,"I bought the ZettaGaurd Smart Socket to use in my living room. I have it plugged into a lamp so i can always control it. On nights that i have to work late it is great to turn on the light from my phone and not come into an empty house. We also use it when going on vacation or an extended weekend. I can grab my phone and turn it on, then turn it off in the morning or at different times. It is a great device to have. At Christmas i think i am going to use it on the tree that we put inside the house by the big front window. This way i can easily turn it on and off nightly if we are away to be festive but not have the tree running for extended periods of time. This is an easy way to have an entry level smart house feature without spending tons of money. it could easily be used in a shed or basement where the lights are not easy to get to in the dark. Lots of good options and a very affordable price.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Cool technology,4.0 ,"I have heard a lot about smart technology like this, so I decided to order one outlet. I hooked it up to my crockpot so I could start the food after I left for work. I marked it 4 stars because the instructions are seriously lacking. I was able to fumble with it a while and get it figured out, and it does work great. It is really cool to be able to control electronics from my phone. It says it can support up to 20 devices but I can't get that part worked out yet. It is cool that you can prevent overcharging with it, which is a big problem with my cellphone.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Good functionality,5.0 ,I decided to get into the world of smart devices and the smartplug seemed like the perfect place to start. This is wifi connected and after linking the device you have incredible functionality using timers. I have this set for my heater in the morning. I have to get up super early for work and having this makes getting up in the morning sooo much easier. My heater turns on and off on its own. Im thinking of buying a few more for lights in my living room to automatically turn on at a certain time for security reasons.,"ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Smart socket is worry free,5.0 ,"Who needs a smart socket? THIS girl!! I suffer from anxiety. every time i leave i wonder if i turned off my straight iron or curling iron. Worry no more...this light is great, once you hook up the app to your phone and your hubbies phone..cause just in case yours is not on you. you can control it. i was able to turn it off 30 miles away. i did several test short distance and it worked great. you can also set it on a timer to go off after a certain amount of time. even better is you can program it to come on a time so you can have your iron ready when you need it. Another thing this will be great for is our trips away i keep a heater in my bird room along with a camera to watch the temp in room. I can easily set the heater on this to come on if it gets too cold. so i dont need to wake up my pet sitter to do it. This has so many great uses.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Great price for such awesome technology,5.0 ,Great smart plug for the price. I absolutely love this. As a mom of 13 kids I am busy ALL of the time. The hair straightener is a bit point of concern. I have such a fear of leaving it on in the mornings and burning down the house. Now all I have to do is use the app and worry no more. I seriously think I am going to buy more of these. I love how easy it is to put an app on your phone and you can control whatever is plugged into it. Such a good price too!,"ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
"Easy to set up, works fast with no probelms",5.0 ,"Awesome smart socket, VERY easy to set up (took less than 5 minutes from opening the package to having it set up and working). All you need to do is download the housemate app to get the socket connected to your wifi network. It works flawlessly and is basically instantaneous when I push the button on my phone the plug immediately activates and turns on whatever I have connected to it. Awesome design and works perfectly. Easy 5/5 stars on this and I can recommend it to anyone who has something in their home that they would like to control via their smartphone. Great buy.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Handy smart plug,5.0 ,Honestly this plug is a great investment! I really like that you can program timers in the app to shut off the plug at diffent times. This also can be used as a deterrent. I thought it would have more features with Alexa but it don't but don't let that steer you away from the item. The price is great for this plug. The app is really nice and it was easy to set up. I set this up on my refrigerator so I can shut the darn thing off when I need to. This is also good for kids room for light out. You can program it to turn off on certain days of the week and times. Really like this plug and do recommend it.,"ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Awesome smart plug,5.0 ,The smart plug is fantastic. It is easy to use and easy to set up. It gives you great versatility as far as being able to turn electric devices on in your home when you are not there. Like let's say that you are out of town but you want to make it appear as if you are home.

Works fine but app invades privacy,2.0 ,"Does exactly what is is supposed to do. Quick setup after you load the app on your phone. But the app is the issue. Why does an app for a smart socket outlet need access to your camera, contacts, photos, location, microphone, phone and storage. Clearly none of this data is required to operate the switch so the ONLY reason would be to invade your privacy.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
So easy and convenient.,5.0 ,Well you can't get any easier than this. Thank you to the Q&A section I discovered I can plug a power tower into it for my office/desk top stuff and turn the tower on and off. That's great because we have a lot of storms and I like to turn all of the peripherals off just in case. Now I can do that easily without having to move furniture away from outlet to unplug or turn off power strip manually and then I can turn the power tower back on as well. Peace of mind. Thanks Q&A,"ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Great programmable smart socket for any home,5.0 ,"I added the smart socket to my smart connect devices in my home, I wanted to be able to use this through my houses wifi setup. Great price and have spent more for other sockets I like that I can plug in more than 1 device to the socket It was easy setup and I was able to control its features through my phone app I am signed up with my local electric co. which gives energy rebates based on usage I can turn and on small appliances","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Works well on 2.4Ghz.Very user friendly!,5.0 ,This is a very good socket for 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi. It works well with the app on my phone. The app is very user friendly and gives good instructions. It gives a little beep and has a light to indicate on/off. It is very nice to be able to turn off lights or other electronics while away from home. It doesn't work on 5Ghz so if your Wi-Fi doesn't show up in the app then that is probably why. It is noted in the documentation and on the app.,"ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Nice for simple control of on/off for whatever is plugged in,5.0 ,"I'm not a fan of needing to use the phone app to control this with no way to do it in a web browser on a PC, but if I really need to, there are scripts to be found that can allow this to execute on a PC. That said, it works perfectly for my needs -- so well that I bought 2 more of them. Setup was fairly easy, though one of the devices was a bit finicky and required multiple attempts to get a connection. Once set up, it has performed flawlessly.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
easy to install.,5.0 ,"Bought as a gift for my mother in law who stumbles around in the dark a lot. My husband told me the clapper was outdated so we figured we would try this out. We installed the app on her phone, it was really easy. She can now turn the light on with the use of the app and ZettaGuard. She loves it and is having an easier time getting around because of it. I like it because it makes things easier for her, and it was easy to install.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4
Google Assistant,4.0 ,"ZettaGuard has a good product for controlling home automation. However, I am a little disappointed by the fact that they do not have an integrated feature within Google Assistant as other smart sockets are able to do. Being able to hands-off speak to Google Assistant to turn on your appliances is more ideal than going back and forth with the app to control your connected appliances. Hoping to see some sort of integration with this feature in the future. Overall, this product is good; however, in terms of ""smart"" there is a little more room to fit in for this great product.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4

Especially when I'm already lying cozily in bed under the warm blankets, the last thing I want to do is get up and physically turn off the light. The package arrived promptly, and set up was a cinch. There are clear instructions on how to set it up. Basically, you connect the Smart Outlet to your Wi-Fi, then download the HouseMate app on your phone. I'm able to control the light anywhere in my 2-story house, so the range is good. It works as intended, no complaints there. It's also quite aesthetically pleasing, with its sleek white design.

I just received this product and I love it. I bought it for my dehydrator,5.0 ,"I just received this product and I love it. I bought it for my dehydrator. I will do a follow up to see how long it lasts. I was reading bad review of people saying the directions to set it up where bad and they need to by a hub. Well READ the directions. This app has different ways to set things up and people are clicking on the shiny add device and guessing what they bought. You have to follow the directions and click the + in the top right. If people can read directions or don't know their wireless ""wifi"" passwords then you need to sell all your computers and phones and get a damn typewriter. One grip I do have about it is the size. I wish it could be smaller but for the price I cant complain. Other then that its working and works good but only time will tell. Its deer season and I have a ton of jerky to make so we will see if it survives and if it keeps lasting I will be buying several more.","ZettaGuard S25 Wi-Fi Smart Socket Outlet US Plug, Turn ON/OFF Electronics from Anywhere, White (HomeMate-App)",B06W2NDRQ4

Great smart-home plugs,5.0 ,"The TP-Link smart plugs have been a great addition to my increasingly-smart home. These plugs connect quickly and are instantly responsive through the Kasa app or Alexa. As other reviewers have noted, to connect to Alexa (which is considered a remote control), you must set the plug up allowing remote--not just local--control. A couple of other comments: The plugs have the benefit of working without a hub, such as Wink. That's great unless you decide to use a hub. If you do, then you'll have a separate app for these plugs, which an extremely minor annoyance. Once you've set up devices and schedules in the app, you'll rarely have to go back to it, since Alexa controls them just fine. (By the way, Kasa is an iPhone app, if you're searching for it on an Apple device--not an iPad app.) I can highly recommend using them in situations where you need a non-dimmable outlet.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

So Convenient and Easy to Use,5.0 ,"TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT) These Smart Plugs are fantastic. I got one first and gave it a try. Then I got this 2-pack. I have them programmed for scenes and linked with our Echo Dots. I also have the Kasa App on my phone. I no longer need to climb behind furniture to get to the plug to change a program. Now I just open the app and change it on my phone. I also have a variety of scenes (programs) for each of the plugs. One of the scenes has variable times so the lamps aren't going on and off at the same time every day and then I have them set so they go on and off and then go on and off again at a little later time. When we were away from home for a week I could check and make sure that the lamps that were plugged into them were on to make the house look like we were home. I have Smart Plugs in three rooms and the old style programmable timers in three others. I didn't know if the others were on even though they were set. I also love that if one of the lamps has already gone off for the night, I can just ask Alexa to turn it back on or I can use the app on my phone. Our house always looks like it is occupied even when we aren't home. It gives me a sense of security.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Awesome functionality, a little tricky to set up",4.0 ,"I replaced two Woods programmable timers with these smart plugs. Previously, if I wanted to manually turn on a lamp, I was always hitting the wrong button, and programming was not straightforward. With these, once they're set up, are a breeze to program, and manual operation is easy peasy. There are areas for improvement, however. Even though I had read reviews and saw pictures, I was surprised at how gigantic these things are. I don't like that they obscure both plugs, no matter how they're positioned. If they must continue to be so large, I'd like to see them make a 2-plug unit (each plug independently programmable). Connection to my network was also a little klugy, but I was able to get them connected using the manual process. Someone with no technical skills might have trouble.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Frustrating setup BUT they work!,4.0 ,"Bought these because of the amazing reviews from others. After setting them up these are FANTASTIC...BUT! be warned set up is frustrating and I'll tell you why. IF you have a spotty wifi signal, or your wifi signal goes in and out then the plugs will not respond during those times. They too will go in and out if your wifi isn't strong. Which means they won't respond and then you'll need to reset them and start over. Also, I noticed that the plugs didn't like being next to other power sources. I had mine set up on a power strip with other plugs and it was having trouble connecting. I moved it to a wall plug and it didn't have any issues after that. Also! I noticed it had issues when it was near water pipes behind the wall, another point at which I had to move it to another plug. That being said it's been a few days with it being set up and I now have ZERO issues. They're a little finicky to set up and I got frustrated, but it eventually worked. For the price you can't beat it, but if you don't want to spend a fortune on setting up your entire house then this is the best bet. LAST issue, when entering your wifi password make sure you don't leave a space at the end and then hit enter because that space will count as a character for your password. Just be warned its frustrating if you have the above issues like I did, even if you're tech oriented like myself. The easiest thing was connecting them to Alexa (amazon echo dot) no issues there. Voice control works great. I can't say the plugs are entirely at fault because the wifi router in our house isn't that great. Which also means I will need to upgrade my wifi router BUT I think its important to let you know so you don't blame the plugs. In regards to the power-strip and water source issue.....that might be something to take into consideration if you want them in the power-strip or configured in a certain area. Just be prepared for plan B. if plan A. doesn't work out for you. Don't be discouraged as everyones house etc is different and every piece of tech works differently for each person.

"Good product, best on market for my situation and needs.",5.0 ,"After doing research, chose this product and happy I did. I wanted a security feature to turn on all lights at once, both within the app and with Echo. Pros: Plugs, bulbs, cameras, AND switches in one system-few manufactures offer all in a single system. (I don't have the camera yet, but I think it works within the same app). Avoids the expense and hassle of separate hub. Works with Echo/Alexa for voice command, if that is to your liking. Timer feature, away/random on feature, all lights at once feature. Products seem sturdy and well built. Everything worked out of the box. To Manufacturer (if you read these): Offer (or 3rd party compatibility of) 3-way wall switch, candelabra base bulbs, exterior flood lites, thermostat, water sensors, and motion sensor for a comprehensive smart home package. While the Kasa app is generally intuitive, you could provide a more comprehensive set of on-line instructions and options. Prospective buyers: Set up required some time and learning curve, but no more so than other moderate-to-complex devices. ONCE SET UP, very easy to learn and operate both within the app and with Alexa. I have a 3 story town home and it does cost some $ to outfit it.

Smart Plug is Smart!,5.0 ,"I originally ordered one of the TP-Link HS100 Smart Plugs when I bought an Amazon Echo Dot (with Alexa). I wanted an easy way to control regular lightbulbs with Alexa, and the TP-Link Smart Plug was the answer. The table lamp by my chair uses an ordinary 200-watt incandescent bulb, a size not readily available in any kind of LED or smart bulb. So I plugged the table lamp into the Smart Plug, set up the Smart Plug through the free iOS app from Kasa, which works seamlessly with Alexa. “Turn Bob’s light on” (or “off”) and Alexa controls the Smart Plug perfectly! Very happy. Or I can control the light through the Kasa app on my iPhone 7 Plus if I don’t feel like talking.

Easy way to get started with home automation,4.0 ,"I found these smart plugs while researching the Amazon Echo's capabilities. Our freestanding living room lamps have a total of NINE bulbs in three different shapes--that's not a good (or economical) setup for smart bulbs such as the Philips Hue, so I decided to give smart plugs a try instead. Shipping via Prime was speedy as usual, so two days after ordering, I was ready to add the lamps to our wifi network. Setup via the Kasa app wasn't entirely painless--the plug needs to connect to wifi, and though they would show as connected in the Settings app on the iPhone, Kasa seemed to take an extra few minutes after that before recognizing the plug and finishing the setup. It's also a little annoying that you can't set up multiple plugs at once. If you're using an Echo or Echo Dot to control your new plugs verbally, you'll also need to link the Kasa app ""skill"" via the Alexa app to get her to discover your new devices. It can all be a little finicky, so bring some patience (and maybe some whiskey) to the process. But--! Once set up, these things combined with an Echo are pure magic. I linked the two plugs controlling our 4 lamp setup into one group in the Alexa app, and now one command turns them all off or on. I used another plug with the entertainment center--like all computerized things, sometimes that setup needs a full power cycle to fix a problem, and now a simple voice command to Alexa allows me to do that without having to move furniture to access the power strip. (The TV, DVR, etc. are also now Alexa-controlled via a Harmony hub.) So, no real hiccups so far other than the minor nuisance of the setup process. The plugs remember their settings even when disconnected, so a power outage doesn't mean you have to set everything up again. Very happy with this purchase right now; I'd give these 4 stars at this point, and they'll get 5 if they prove to be durable over time.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

No bridge required!,5.0 ,"Lot's of choices out there right now for smart home products that are compatible with Alexa. I stumbled upon TP-Link when I chose a smart switch for my carriage lights and knew little about smart home lights and switches. It was a good choice too, because although Alexa my be able to control them all, it is possible that different bridges may be needed to control the different products. At $60 to $100 each, that's an expensive proposition. This is where the TP-Link comes in. I wired my TP-Link smart switch and synced with the Kasa app and Alexa, and my outdoor lighting problem was solved. Then I ordered different brand that said it was compatible with Alexa, not realizing it needed a bridge, returned it, and picked up these instead. They have worked flawlessly. They do do not cover both outlets like some plugs do, are easily added to the Kasa app and synchronized with Alexa.

These work perfectly. I can't recommend them enough!,5.0 ,"WOW. I love these things. My wife thinks I'm a nerd for getting them, but this is the coolest thing I've bought in a long time. Here's what I did... Amazon Echo Tap TP-Link Smart Plugs 1: Connected to a pole light in the living room. 2: Connected to another pole light in the living room. I created a ""scene"" called ""Living Room Off"" which has, you guessed it, both lights off. I created another one called Living Room On. Eventually I'll get a couple more of these and have one for ""movie mode"" or ""sleep mode"" or something, so I can have certain lights on for when we're watching a movie, or when the little ones are asleep. I can just say, ""Alexa, turn on the living room,"" and my lights turn on. No RF crap like I used to experience from the big box home improvement store's RF switch. It just works. I can also turn the lights on and off from the bedroom from my Amazon Tap, or using the Kasa app on my phone. I feel like the possibilities are endless with what I can do with these switches. The fact that I can turn the lights on for my father-in-law who is technologically declined, no matter where I am, is fantastic. The next thing I'm going to tackle is the ability to turn on and off the TV, then change the channels for him, no matter where I am.

Works great with Echo Dot but a bit tricky to set up.,4.0 ,"This works great with Echo my Echo Dots but a bit tricky to get onto my WiFi. I run my WiFi open (no password), but use MAC address authentication and do not broadcast my SSID. The Kasa app requires one of the three types of encryption. The TP-Link support site offers a firmware upgrade that is supposed to fix this if you enable SSID broadcast during the provisioning process and then turn it off after the unit has associated with the WiFI. I could not make this work and had to set up a second SSID on my AP the uses WPA in order to get it set up and keep it on the network. You can only run the Kasa app on iOS (iPhone) or Android (phone oe tablet w/GPS), but the firmware upgrade is a Windows based program that flashes the unit, so you need a Windows system connected to your WiFi in order to apply the updates. I found no mention of this in the support article. I used an Android tablet to provision the HS100s and discovered that they want to record your location with the unit profile and since my Tablet does not have GPS, I have to look up my Lat. & Long. in order to finish the setup. This is a nice piece of hardware, but the firmware and provisioning software were implemented with too many assumptions about the operational environment. I suspect this may cause some folks to give up on it before they get it set up.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

"Not Ready for Prime Time. Totally unreliable access to, and control of, plugs. Terrible support made it worse, bricking one plug",1.0 ,"UPDATE: After TP-Link saw my review, I received an email saying they wanted to help and asking me to click a link to customer support. Despite not wanting to waste more time, I fell for it, thinking I would get a live chat or a callback. Nope. I clicked on the link, which required me to send yet another email. I did not get a response until two days later asking me to call the main tech support number (which ihad already spent an hour with before, as described below). I called twice today after getting yet another email telling me they were going to close my support ticket unless I called. Got the usual VM system. After being told each time that I was customer 1 on the wait list, within two minutes, the support service switched to another line or area, and kept asking me in Chinese and English to ""please dial the extension directly."" What extension? It gave no options. It repeated this message continuously. After a few minutes of hearing this repeated and no one picking up, I hung up. If I could reduce this rating to zero stars, I would. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Worked fine for a few weeks, then stopped allowing consistent local (via phone or tablet on same wifi network) control. Worked fine if I turned wifi off on my phone and connected to devices via Kasa app remotely. On wifi, sometimes the devices could connect, sometimes no, telling me to ""try again later"". Spent over an hour with various tech support people. Upgraded firmware on each plug. When they told me to then reset and reconfigure one device to test, the Kasa app (on phone or tablet) will see and connect to the new device, but will not let me add any new devices anymore because it will no go past the device naming screen (even if I attempt to leave the default name). So the update and reset made the reconfigure plug device unusable. The other devices I updated (but did not reset) and they work fine for remote control. But i still cannot control them via my devices if they are on the same wifi network. Another tech product that is supposed to make life easier, but makes it more difficult by requiring and wasting our time, by not reliably doing the very job they are sold.

Love these,5.0 ,"I love these TP link outlets. They can be controlled from the Kasa App even when you are away from home. I have under cabinet lights plugged into it so I don’t have to use the switch. I just ask Alexa to turn them on or off. And I can schedule them to automatically turn on and off, so they come on in the dark kitchen every morning just a few minutes before I usually stumble in to make coffee. They work fantastically well with Alexa. If the power goes out I have never had to rediscover them with Alexa after the power comes back on. And the best part? You don’t have to use a hub if you have Alexa and the Kasa App. From now on, I will only buy the TP link products.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

The uptime for TP-link Smart plugs (both the original oval shaped ones and this) has been 100% for me. Very reliable. For your consideration, I have had them for about 3mths - 1 year so far.

Happy and Smarter,5.0 ,"I am very happy with my TP-Link Smart Plugs. I purchased several before I got my Echo Dot. They are very easy to set up and work wonderful. I only had a problem with one and I think that is my fault. When setting it up my selected the wrong network connection, I thought it was part of their setup, Whoops. I had to research on what to do and found the answer on how to reset it. It took a couple of tries but finally figured out. Sometimes I still have a problem with it saying ""local only"" again that could be still my fault because where I have the plug the signal as strong or the plug was loose. So those things are something I can do something about. Now I have my Alexa, she recogized the plugs easily and I'm very happy. The only con is that once an item is plugged to the smart plug, you shouldn't shut it off yourself, because when you ask Alexa to turn it on, she thinks she has, but it doesn't come on. You can then turn it on manual. So let her do the work for you.

It's just a shame they can't fine-tune power settings.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Pulled it out of the box, plugged it in, downloaded the app, created an account and confirmed my email, configured the plug to my wifi, added Kasa to my echo, and turned off the light.. in 4 minutes and 40 ish seconds. All I have to say is ""Alexa turn the living room lights on/off"" and bam.. under one second it works. I bought the two pack so I could use in the living room and another set of lights, one with normal echo and the other with my echo dot.

Having fun with this.,4.0 ,"Feedback for the seller is nothing but positive. I received the package in the mail on the day predicted. Two brand new plugs and well-packaged. Regarding the product itself, I'm happy with it. It's an interesting thing not having to physically touch a lamp or switch to get the lights to turn on or lying in bed and telling the coffee pot to turn on. So far I own 5 of these. Two had to go back (not from the seller) because they either kept dropping the internet connection or said they were connected but didn't respond. Those were replaced without question with two that work just fine. Final thought... if you are connecting this to Amazon Echo keep in mind you need to speak the commands. If somebody is asleep and you come into the room and say ""Alexa, bedroom lights on or bedroom lights off"" chances are you're going to disturb the person who is asleep. If you already own an Amazon Echo you know you can't whisper to it. I'm waiting for the embedded chip in your head that will turn the lights on and off when I think about it.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Great Smart Plugs,5.0 ,"""Alexa Turn on the living room lamp."" Yes it is that easy. You can plug a single device or a power strip with multiple devices, and this switch enables you to turn them off or on just by speaking to Alexa. I currently have mine hooked up to my living room lamp, which is so nice. I come in the door from work and say ""Alexa turn on the living room lamp"" and instantly have light in the living room. The second one I use with my TV and devices hooked up. When I'm ready I tell Alexa to turn on my TV and all my devices are immediately turned on and ready to go. I truly believe the sky is the limit for these smart plugs. On top of all that, these smart plugs allow people to save money on products always plugged in. Take for instance your TV. Your TV is always plugged in and is always drawing electricity, even when it is off. This device saves you money by letting you completely shutoff power to plug completely.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
These outlets were super easy to set up,5.0 ,"These outlets were super easy to set up. I had both outlet adapters linked to my phone and wifi within 1 or 2 minutes. The Kasa app has perfect set by step instructions. Use the Kasa app is very simple and has a great design. For each outlet you can set an icon for a device you are using it for, set an on/off schedule, set up an away schedule for when your on travel, and a timer for how long you want the device to be on. There is also a breakdown of how many hours you use the device. I has current run time and an Average/Total runtime for the past 7 and 30 days. It is great to keep an eye on your power usage. When hooking it up to Amazon Echo i ran into a little bump, but that was my fault. You have to add Kasa to your Alexa skills then you can pair the outlets to Alexia.

These are awesome! Basically it works by connecting to your WiFi ...,4.0 ,"These are awesome! Basically it works by connecting to your WiFi and then you can use it with your app or through an Alexa skill. They essentially work by cutting off the power source so when you 'turn it off' it's actually more like unplugging it. So. Unless you have other appliances with an on/off switch, they're really only good for lamps. Fortunely for me tho, I have a TV that will automatically turn on when it's been unplugged! Depending on where I put them I can tell Alexa to turn on or off my TVs, living room lamps, and even my bedroom lamp (with Alexa remote). Downside is that it takes some getting used to. My bf forgot it was on the living room lamp and instead of asking Alexa to turn it off, he would turn it off manually. This essentially renders the smartness of the outlet useless because next time you ask Alexa to turn it on, she thinks it's already on!","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
This home automation is really starting to grow on me,5.0 ,"This home automation is really starting to grow on me. The problem is like the old Betamax versus VHS, no standardization. Using Alexa kinda solves the problem, instead of a bunch of apps on my phone to control each device separately, I stay with Amazon Echo compatible devices and let Alexa do all of the work. SinTP-Link does not require a hub, it makes setup and installation a breeze. I will stick with them for all of my switch needs. Put some thought into your plan, you will probably need more wall switches than plug switches. Think about it? How many plug in items to you use that need automation besides a few lamps? A wall switch can control many regular bulbs that are much cheaper. These plug switches are simple to use and work great.

After installing the Kasa app. (If it's an ipad, filter the search in the app store for iphone) and creating an account on Kasa, go straight to the website for support - as the app. is not exactly user friendly. The app. requires a password to sign-in to your network. As I usually use MAC addresses on my wireless network, finding a network with a password to install this on was no fun. (I wonder if this can be installed without a password?) Not to mention whenever I got on the TP-Link wi-fi network, after a few minutes my ipad kept switching to another network with a better signal.

The only con, that was an expected con so no stars off as I knew this when buying it, is that it really does eat both sockets if you are like me and the top socket is on a light switch in most places so you want this on the bottom.

These Work Great But There's a Catch,3.0 ,"I purchased eight of these to use with Alexa/Echo Dots. They worked amazingly well until March 3, 2017 when I came to realize the consequences of the way these work. What happened was that the server linking TP-Link switches to the Alexa system stopped working. All of a sudden, Alexa couldn't find any of my TP-Link switches. This makes me think that if this company ever fails or decides they are tired of supporting that server and turns it off, all of these switches will stop. Now, I should add that, during the outage, the Kasa app on my iPad and Android phone would still switch them on and off, but I bought these to work with Alexa. You might want to investigate other brands that work with Alexa internally on your WiFi network rather than relying on an outside server to connect to Alexa. Alexa requires a server at Amazon to work at all, but with these TP-Link switches, that makes two servers that must be working. Considering the millions of these Echo products that Amazon has sold, I certainly trust Amazon to keep things working more reliably. Indeed, during the outage, Alexa continued to work just fine.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

The initial setup using a smartphone was easy and configuring for use with Alexa was also easy using the Alexa app. We really like the ability to have lamps turn on at random times within a defined timeframe while we are away to give the appearance that someone is home. My only criticism about these plugs is that they are so big they block out the second outlet. I used a power strip to fix that problem.

I only had 2 uses for smart controls, so didn't want to bother with hubs that could control more devices for much less expensive per-unit cost. Only covers 1/2 of an outlet = other side can be used for regular plug or flat extension cord, but can't use 2 of these in 1 outlet - but you probably want a hub system if you are using that many.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

I plan to use the programming feature the next time we are vacation to vary the times the lights go on and off in various parts of the house.

"Wonderful! Now, let me save you some time...",5.0 ,"I love this device, now that it's finally set up with my Echo Dot. It was a bit frustrating at first. Do yourself a favor and watch a You Tube video. The key things to know are that you have to download TP-Link Kasa application to your smart phone (be sure to create an account...don't hit ""Skip"") and then add the Kasa skill to the Echo. After you have entered your devices in the Kasa app navigate to Home - Tap a device you've now set up then go up to the icon in the right corner and move the Remote Control so it shows green.

Great timer with nice smartphone interface,4.0 ,"Plug works great. I have two of these plugs that I purchased to regulate lighting in my saltwater aquarium. Setup app on iPhone not as easy as it is supposed to be, but I am very tech savvy so I was able to extrapolate enough from other similar equipment setups to make it work. The only other problem I had was when I moved locations and plug needed to be connected to a different wifi network. It took me about an hour to figure out how to reassign plug to the new network. Not straightforward at all. But other than those setup issues (only reason I didn't give it 5 stars) the plugs work great and I'm very happy with them.

"Works Well, Too Bulky",4.0 ,"These work well and work with both Echo and Kasa. They were really easy to set up. My only complaint is that they are large, so when you plug them into the outlet, they slightly block the bottom outlet, so it's the only thing you can plug in. They do work with an extension cord or power strip, however. For instance, I have two lamps in close proximity to one another, so I have the extension cord plugged into the wireless plug and can control both lamps at once. Similarly, you can plug the wireless plug into a power strip and control one device and not the others on the power strip.

These work great for WiFi plugs,5.0 ,These work great for WiFi plugs. I used a plug adapter to make the switch stick out from the wall.

I'm definitely going to buy more overtime so that I can fully automated my home lights. Only downside is is that it's large and will cover the outlet below it when connected.

Just not reliably connected.,2.0 ,"Update--this hasn't gotten any better, actually is worse. I would say we only get it to turn the light on or off on command about 25% of the time. I have reset, unplugged, reinstalled, etc, etc and it is just not reliable. Actually more of a headache than not. We are going to just get rid of them. Maybe eventually they will get something that works. This isn't it. I was really looking forward to using this with my phone and Alexa. And it is great--when it works. But, I guess, if you don't use it at least once every 4-6 hours, it stops working. We use it to turn on and off a couple of lamps in the house, each about once a day. At least every other day now (at first not that often), we try several times, Alexa tries for awhile then says it is not connected. My phone has the same issues. Then, sometimes after several minutes, the lamp just pops on! Finally connected, but when you need the light, it just isn't reliable. Great for those areas you can wait for up to 3-4 minutes before it finally comes on.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

So Large It Blocks The Outlet,3.0 ,"Although not as easy to set up as the simplistic TP-Link instructions would have you believe, with some patience you can get it to work using the Alexa and Kasa phone apps. Twice when I added a new HS 100 doing so fouled up the existing connections and I had to re-do the originals. The biggest complaint I have is that these are HUGE. If you plug it into the bottom outlet the top is blocked. If you plug it into the top the bottom overhangs the outlet below and only a flat plug will work. I had to use a power strip because I had a wall wart for a Wifi Range Extender plugged into the outlet and both won't fit. It blocks outlets on either side when using a power strip. I think that over time this technology will mature but at the moment it isn't for people who mind tinkering and are patient enough to work beyond the instructions (which only cover the ""happy path"") to figure out why it isn't working as it should.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Great addition to the smart home. Very behind-the-times range extender. I'm not using it.,3.0 ,"I love the TP-Link plugs. I have several that work flawlessly with Alexa. The WiFi range extender portion of this product is very out of date. The internet speed is very slow. Also, if your house is like mine, this device will end up a foot from the floor; far from the optimum distance to locate WiFi antennas. This unit is nearly twice the price of the ""plain"" TP-Link socket. It's not worth it. That's the bad news. The good news is that the remote controlled socket is wonderful and is easy to connect to Alexa. All you have to do is download the phone app (Kasa) and follow the directions for installation. Kasa will also guide you through the steps to enable the WiFi extender. Once installed, be sure to turn on ""remote"" if you want the Amazon Echo to control it. Then, in the Alexa app, select the Kasa skill and enable it. Then, have Alexa search for devices and Voila! you are all set. The only reason I give this version of an otherwise-five-star device is the WiFi range extender. It is ok if you have a weak signal where you want to to control other outlets. In that case, this range extender is perfectly adequate for ""talking"" to other smart devices. Otherwise, it is just too slow for the kind of performance we expect. The floor-level antenna positioning doesn't help either. There is a theoretical vulnerability to hackers since all these devices are connected to the Internet via your WiFi Access Point / Router. This is true of anything connected to the Internet. So far, devices that are part of The Internet Of Things (IOT) tend to have vulnerability here. I've chosen to take the risk in return for the convenience of, ""Alexa, turn on Bob's reading light.""","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Kasa just isn't ready for prime time and recent upgrades have made it worse,1.0 ,"Used to deserve 4 stars. However last two updates apparently first terminated integration with Alexa so Alexa can't talk to TPLINK devices - the only reason you'd want it. And latest updates have now made it incompatable with Android so the Kasa app won't run devices at all. No tech support and thehelp pages go to broken websites. Sadly a great product is now useless. Don't buy it. I'm not sure why they'd breakup with Amazon, and with Android but that makes it useless for most people. Since my above review a month ago, Kasa did resume working with Android... but... Edited 4-7-2017 -With time Alexa, Echo and Kasa have become more nightmarish and less useful - each time the power goes out (and that happens with some frequency in the south) Alexa, Echo and Kasa EACH play dumb and won't reconnect with wifi (funny how my phone and laptop have no such issue)... so I have tomanually turn the lights on and off three timesper bulb and do three manual reconnects and then do the same for every smart plug - the process takes about an hour for 6 items as the automatic modes on Kasa tend to fail... the sad thing is that as they upgrade software this gets worse... if I could give ZERO stars I would. This is simply NOT ready for retail.

Much better Smart Plugs than WEMO,5.0 ,"I purchased these smart plugs to replace two WEMO units which were unreliable and kept dropping their wifi connection.

"Stays connected for a short while, then loses communication until I plug/unplug the unit and reset.",1.0 ,"I received my plugs a few days ago and have, so far, only installed one to control a lamp from bed without having to get up. I am using the Kasa app on an iPad. I set everything up following the exact instructions from TP-Link and the plug works for a little bit after I have set it up, turning the lamp on and off with a satisfying click. But the connection doesn’t last. If I try to turn the lamp on/off through Kasa, it can't communicate with the smart plug and times out. It does this until I unplug and plug back in the unit and try again, which is totally not feasible and takes me way longer than just flipping a switch like a neanderthal. Perhaps my wifi settings are wrong, but the truth is the 'help' section and faq/support sections on the TP-Link site and in the Kasa app are unhelpful. I will work a few more days on this problem and will be returning the unit if I can't find a solution. I will update this review if anything changes.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Works well but blocks my other socket,4.0 ,"These smart plugs are easy to set up on a 2.4 Ghz wifi network, no Echo required. Of course, having an Echo or Echo Dot set up makes controlling my lamp less of a headache. You can get away with not setting up a Kasa account if you just want to use the Kasa app on your phone. But be sure to sign up for the Kasa account, verify e-mail, log out of Kasa, and log back in before doing the Alexa setup for an Echo. I docked a star mainly because of the obvious design flaw apparent in other reviewers' photos. The adapter plugs into one socket, yet manages to partially block the other. That's silly. Not a unique problem, however. Many of the other smart plugs on the market have this issue. Another drawback is that TP-link does not work with Google Home (yet?). So if at some point you get sick of Alexa not being able to answer your questions and would prefer the Google AI, you have to buy new smart plugs too! A Belkin Wemo smart plug is a cross-platform solution and from the Amazon picture looks like it may interfere less with the 2nd socket, but is more expensive and has somewhat spottier reviews.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Do NOT buy this product!!!,1.0 ,"Let me preface by saying I have been in IT since 1989 - so I am not stranger to technology. I have three of these units. Every time I leave the house for a prolonged time, I se these up in various rooms. I then set the schedule for the lights to go on/off at specific times. First time these items were in action, I checked my house security cams to find that the lights are off when they are supposed to be on, and on when they're supposed to be off. Random times. I attributed this to a user error. Second time I took a trip, I made sure I was VERY careful not to make any scheduling errors. Came home early from a trip and one of the lights is on when it's supposed to be off. WTF??? I check the app and the schedule. Seems to be setup correctly. TP-Link support is offshore, and barely speaks English. User forums are useless. So something that is supposed to be super simple to use has is NOT, and has wasted hours of my time troubleshooting, calling support and posting on the forums. Seriously people, get another product, pay more, get better quality.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Works well but could be better.,4.0 ,"It works well enough. Installation was fairly easy but when connecting it to Google Home make sure to install all units and have them configured within Kasa app first before linking the Kasa account account to Google Home. Took me some time before I figured that out. The available options for automatic control are great. Fairly easy to set up and quite useful when the whole family went on a long trip. I tested it for a couple of nights and it worked great. It has the option to set a specific on/off schedule, random on/off ""Away"" mode, or Timer. The scenes options are also good to have to easily control all units at once. One thing, after a while my wife and kids got tired of having to go out of the room to near the stairs and yell out ""OK Google"" to turn off the lights. My wife refused to install the app on her phone and my kids don't have 24/7 access to any mobile device yet. Now for the upstair units they went back to just flipping the light switch on/off. I guess I need another Google Home unit in each room. Hopefully Google comes up with Alexa Dot copy-cat soon.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Design Problem You Should Be Aware Of,3.0 ,"The TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug does everything it is suppose to do. I have my office light turn on at 5:00 am and off at Sunrise. Living room turns at Sunset and off at 10:00 pm. You can control on and off functions via the App or Alexa. So far a strong 5 stars. I gave the Smart Plug 3 stars because of poor design. All my electrical outlet are your standard two plug outlets, (duplex receptacles). The TP-Link fits in the top receptacle, but is too large and hangs down to the bottom receptacle so I can only use one receptacle. I had to install an extension cord for the TP-Link for one controlled Smart Plug which allows me to have my Alarm Clock plugged into the other receptacle. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love these TP-Link Smart Plugs, but they are bulky and take up two electrical receptacles. Either put in a second receptacle in the TP Plug for constant power or redesign the plug so it does not partially cover the lower receptacle. Hope this review provides information for you to make an informed decision. Attached photo shows TP-Link impinging on second receptacle making it unusable.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Good for lamps and other devices like that but not for TV's and satellite/cable receivers or sound bars,3.0 ,"These work as advertised in that you can use Alexa to turn things off and on, however the problem lies with the power source being completely shut off when these are ""turned off"". When you plug something into a wall outlet and use a remote control to shut off a TV or cable receiver, the unit shuts off but there is still power going to these items it so that it retains the settings. With these plugs, it's as if you are unplugging the unit from the wall entirely and disconnecting power all together which renders them basically useless for use on TV's and cable receivers. I was able to turn my TV and receiver off and on but once I turned them off they were disconnected from power entirely and when turned back on had to go through the startup sequence. When using them in a group, again, it worked but not as well as just using the remote because the receiver had to go through the startup process and the sound bar didn't connect to the TV as it normally would by simply using a remote and having the items plugged into the wall directly. If there was a way to design these to keep power going to these units when turned off they would be great. For now I will just have to find some other lamps or something in my house to utilize them.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Very frustrated,1.0 ,"Frustrating junk. I went through he setup process but was unable to turn on 'Remote Control' in the app which is required for Amazon Echo control.

Support person said she would speak with a senior engineer and reply back to me via e-mail. I have a number of iot devices in my house and NEVER had any difficulty setting them up. I will update this review if the senior engineer finds a solution, but otherwise I would say to avoid this product (especially if you are not comfortable fooling around with your router settings). 1/9/17 Update: still waiting for and e-mail from the 'senior engineer'.

I load the app like it says,1.0 ,"I load the app like it says. I register and get the email like it says. It says you have to confirm the email within an hour. Ten minutes I confirm the email and get a congratulations message on their website. I plug in the device and wait for the blinking amber/green and run through the instructions on the app. It gives me a place to enter my password for the network but doesn't say what network. I type in the password and it says invalid WEP password length. I click the link that says I'd like to use a different network and a blank network displays and a network with a dollar sign and a question mark displays. I click can't find my network. It says check my router. All my computers are working on the network just fine so router is good. Click rescan and same crap. I call tech support, which says available 24/7. It says press 3 for plugs. I press 3. After about 20 seconds it lists the options again and says press 3 for plugs. I press three. It list the options and says press 3. I hang up and call back. As soon as the message starts playing I press 3. I get to the next level of incompetence. They have you on hold and every few minutes they say no technician is available and if I don't press 1 they will disconnect the call. I keep pressing 1. I notice that my phone is no longer connected to my network but is connected to TP-LINK_Smart Plug_3118 wifi. So I reconnect it to my network. I get the device to link to the app/network (it finally displays my network) but it says email not confirmed. Although, I got the congratulations from the website. The app says local only, which I assume means I have to be on the network to turn the device on and off. I try resending the confirmation email several times but never receive one. I got the device to actually turn on once and then never again. The TP-Link network now says No Internet Access Detected, won't automatically reconnect. I have to start over. I cannot reset the device as the app just locks up. I have several home automation switches and lights and have them all working with my phone and Amazon Echo, so it is not like I haven't done this before. My mistake was thinking that I was getting a WEMO switch. I try again. This time I select the option to manually set up the wifi. It says congratulations I can now use my device. My device is greyed out. I click on it and it says Remote Control Disabled. You can enable Remote Control when youre connected to your home Wi-Fi. I am connected to my wifi. I am now stuck here with no idea what to try next. I browse help topics and click on Kasa Account. It takes me to import calendar events. I click on Device Installation tips and it takes me to import calendar events. I click on Adding a Device to a Kasa and it takes me to import calendar events. I tried calling support again and got someone who's English is not their first language. She was very nice and had me run through basically everything I did and had me move the switch to the same room as the router and we got the same results each time. She finally asked me to change the channel on my router, which was when I decided that was more than I should have to do just to get this thing to work. This is the worst home automation product I've ever gotten. I tried the chat but it just went to a blank webpage (new tab). I cannot find where I clicked to try to get the email resent as it doesn't exist any longer. I have uninstalled/installed the app 4 times. They include a card that wants you to tell people how happy you are on their facebook/twitter accounts. Guess it's a good thing I don't have those apps. I'll just have to return this and get a WEMO like I had planned.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

It does not work with Amazon Alexa,1.0 ,"It does not work with Amazon Echo. It works with the Kaza APP to control the Smart Plug but when I tried to ask Alexa to learn the skill by enable the TP-Link Smart Plug, it only comes up with a blank screen. I have purchased 4. 2 of them works but 2 of them does not. I spent hours with the tech support on phone and they walked me through each step of enabling but without any success. I was told to upgrade the firmware and I did but it still does not connect to Alexa. So I purchased another 2 of the Mini Smart Plug thinking these are new item and should have the latest firmware on them, but no luck, same problem. I called the tech support again, and again tried everything such as delete the device, install it again, update the firmware, check the settings, even uninstall the Amazon Alex, and re install it again. Same issue, blank screen right after you tap ""enable"" the skill. The tech support finally told me that it is a problem of Amazon Alexa and suggest that I should call Amazon for help. I don't agree so and I purchased the Wemo mini smart plug and everything works fine including the ""enable the skill"".","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Technical issue - No IFTTT compatibility!!,1.0 ,"These plugs do work as advertised and were relatively painless to set up with Alexa. BUT...there is a major technical issue with these plugs that is causing me to write this review. If you want to use IFTTT or Yonomi software to make Alexa do even more amazing things then do not purchase these plugs as they are not compatible with IFTTT and Yonomi. Other than Alexa, they really have no compatibility to anything worth using. IFTTT is the industry standard and for a device not to have this connectivity is a major technical error. Wemo plugs do. If all you ever plan to do is issue a simple voice command via Alexa to turn these plugs on/off then TP-Link will work for you. Alexa allows these to be grouped with other devices in the Alexa app as well. But if you want to create ""recipes"" in IFTTT that Alexa can use then these plugs will not work for you. Another gripe: the TP-Link app does not have the capability to set up timers. I purchased these smart plugs specifically to use instead of timers for lights only to be disappointed that I couldn't set them up as such in the app nor could I use IFTTT to do that. Went out to the store to get a Wemo plug and not only did the app have timer capability but it has the IFTTT logo on the box. The only positive comments I have are they easy to install and have a slightly smaller profile than the Wemo plugs. They also have a quieter ""click"" noise when they are activated. I really wanted to like these, but they are being returned along with the TP-Link bulb.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Update: Below is a link which guides you on how to get this working with smartthings.

SMART PLUG - NO SUPPORT,1.0 ,"SMART PLUG - NO SUPPORT After Spending a half a day trying to get this to work, I gave up. I was able to create a TP Link Cloud account and it was downhill from then on. Part of the setup to get it working with Alexa is you have to re-enter your TP Link cloud Account info. App Told me my password was incorrect. Could not log into my cloud account either. Eventually I clicked on the ""forgot my password"" link. Never was sent a reset link for my password to my registered email account (They did initially send me a ""Welcome To TP link"" email so I at least know they had my correct email address) . I Gave up. Tried again the next morning. Again, ""forgot my password link"" did not work. Called tech support. Ended up talking to someone in New Dehli India, who I could totally not understand. She sent me a link to TP-Link's FAQ page. Bottom Line, if your password ever gets Hosed, you are toast. Too Bad. Looks like a nice product!

Great for Echo Owners but Expensive and Tricky to Setup,4.0 ,"Works great with Amazon Echo - but beware there are multiple steps to getting this to all work correctly. Not for the non-technical. Sometimes the 2.5ghz wifi connection drops, and I have to try and turn on/off lights with their mobile app several times. Probably an issue with thier cloud settings or possibly latency delays. Also the plugs are big - so as one other reviewer wrote get a short 1ft ext cord instead of plugging this directly into your wall outlet so that you can still use the other outlet. Connecting these wall outlets to the wifi router and mobile app was a pain. It took about 10 re-trys to finally get a solid green. Thats a problem. Echo voice commands work well, and setting up groups is easy and convenient. These plugs are really expensive (obviously) and since they transmit on your wifi continually, I wouldnt expect them to last for years and years. Also don't bother calling the 1-866 tech support number....no one will ever answer.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
I think this product is a great idea - however,3.0 ,"I think this product is a great idea - however. I wanted to use the product to turn on-off lights and appliances while I was away from home and having the ability to control the smart plug through the Kasa app was a nice feature. The problem is, to work correctly the smart plugs need a constant wireless signal. And if your home is like mine, there are some locations that do not get a strong WiFi signal and especially since the plug could be low and even behind furniture, etc. If the smart plug is not receiving a usable signal during a scheduled event then that event fails (does not turn off/on). This could also be the case when trying to access the smart plug remotely. When the smart plug has a good signal it seems to work as advertised. I actually returned this product for the reasons mention above. I did not think it was reasonable to buy something like a WiFi extender just to make sure the smart plug had sufficient signal to work correctly.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
but this could have easily been a one star review,5.0 ,"Right now it is working 100% as expected, but this could have easily been a one star review. Had the same issue as others with being unable to control the outlet remotely (fine over the home wi-fi, but unable to connect from anywhere else) . Uninstalled the app, re-installed it, signed in to my account on the app, checked it was version 1.3.2, and allowed the app to re-recognize my previous configuration. Tested and is now working 100% as expected. A little nervous because I can't put my finger on exactly what went wrong, but I guess there must have been some issue with the first install that only affected the remote control. Again, works great now! Follows remote commands way quicker than I expected (no more than a second or two to turn off and on). And, forgetting about that original issue, was a cinch to install and set-up.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Disappointed,1.0 ,"Very disappointed. Does not work well with my Comcast router. It loses the wifi signal a lot. It also does not work if I am away from my home. When it is wifi connected, it only works when I'm at home. I talked to TP-Link tech support. Their first recommendation was that I buy a TP-Link router. The second recommendation was way out of my league – if you are familiar with opening router ports, DHCP, etc then go for it. Tech support also sent me a firmware upgrade to try. However, it would not connect to my plugs. I’m sure this product works better with different routers than mine. I do have a number of wireless products that work good with my router including a sprinkler system, thermostat, and Alexa. So maybe TP-Link has some work to do here to catch up. I would not recommend this product unless you are sure your router is compatible with the plugs. Or if you are tech savvy and can make the aforementioned router changes. Good luck!","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

App needs more features!!!,3.0 ,"HS200. Minus 2 stars because the app is missing too many features. There needs to be a demo mode for the app so that we can check the features first. 5 Stars for the operation of the switch though and you can control it with Alexa. TP-link app only lets you set home and away MODES but does not actually detect when you are home or away. Thus, you can't have lights turn on automatically when you arrive home. BOOOOO!!!

Not directly compatible with SmartThings,2.0 ,"I got fooled. These units need their own app. I'm heavily invested in ZWave/Zigbee services and use a Samsung Smartthings hub. Smartthings has WIFI support, but the TP-Link isn't a supported device. You have to go load yet another app, then do some very serious programming I wouldn't recommend to non-techs to get this to 'bridge' over to your SmartThings. While it is possible, you need a dedicated server or at least a Rasberry PI to bridge between these and Samsungs world. Once I did all that, I was successful in getting it all to work with Samsung, and therefore Alexa. Also, the HS100 model is OLD. it does NOT support power monitoring, AND has other compatibility issues. the HS110 is better but the price is NOT very good. I will mention these have a very high wattage rating, and can run just about anything you plug in (fridge/AC etc.) while lower priced units are good for lamps and low consumption devices, these do rate well in that area. When I bought my first ones, they were $19. Since then the price is $39. The $54 2 pack is the older HS100 model AND sold out just about everywhere, including here on Amazon.

Grrr,3.0 ,"I bought this 2-pack of smart plugs, set them up with the app, plugged in our lamps, and synced them to Alexa so I can control our lighting by voice command. The whole thing took maybe 15 minutes at most. I wanted to use one of the plugs to turn our entertainment system on & off but our TV was not compatible (it doesn't come on automatically when it's plugged in). And turning things off by killing the power might not be so good for the electronics anyway. I was super happy, 5 stars. Five days later, after a brief power outage, Alexa stopped recognizing my lamps. I went into the Kasa app and they were marked as ""local only"" (I could turn them off/on at the outlet or using the Kasa app, but Alexa didn't know they existed). I tried toggling the switch for ""remote control"" but that didn't work (kept getting various errors). I used the reset button on one outlet, deleted it from all of the apps, and even disabled/re-enabled the Kasa skill within Alexa. The result was more error messages. After an hour or so of trying various things, we're back in business but the whole thing was super frustrating so I am rethinking my plan to roll this out to the rest of the house.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Frustrating!,1.0 ,"03/15/17 - I purchased this in January as a birthday gift for my husband, who loves ""techy"" stuff. He procrastinated on setting up the plugs, so I finally gave it a shot. These plugs refused to connect to our Wi-Fi - I tried everything recommended on manufacturers site and nothing. I am somewhat stubborn, and believe that I am capable of following directions and setting up electronic devices, so after a few days of cooling off, I tried again. Nothing. This went on for a few weeks - I would try to set them up, get frustrated, wait a few days and then try again. Then, on Monday of this week, I tried once more, and - voila, they connected on the first try, synced with our Echo Dot and worked perfectly for ONE DAY. That night, I went to bed with working plugs, and the next morning, they were disconnected, and I have not been able to connect them again. I know that if they were able to connect once, they are caplable of connecting again. Tried all day (off and on) yesterday and off and on again today. I am beyond through with these plugs. Unfortunately, due to my husband's procrastination and my stubborness, it is beyond the return window so I will just have to chalk it up to experience. 03/17 - I attempted to re-install these plugs again today, and miraculously, they connected to my wifi network like magic! I will use them as long as they keep working, but I doubt I will buy this brand in the future, and I am looking for wall switches next.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

OOHHs and AAHHs like they just watched a magician disappear,5.0 ,"Three months ago, I purchased the Amazon Echo. It arrived on the same day my family left for an overseas vacation. For six weeks, it was just Alexa and me. What a great time. She played my audiobooks, my albums and my favorite podcasts. Every day, she provided me a daily news briefing and the weather forecast. I researched and tested the ever-growing list of skills developed for the Amazon Echo. For all of the uses we’ve enjoyed with our Amazon Echo, our home had not yet evolved into a Smart Home. Yesterday, we plugged in our TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug (2-Pack, HS100 KIT) . Quickly and effortlessly, we connected the plugs to our Wi-Fi network with the Kasa App on our Samsung Galaxy GS7 phones . We plugged our living room lamp (the one in the farthest corner of the room) into the TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug. We first tested the plug with the Kasa App, then with the Amazon Echo. “Alexa, please turn on the living room lamp.” [Click] Oohhs and aahhs like they just watched a magician disappear… We tested the timer feature and created a lighting schedule. This particular lamp doesn’t have a dimming feature but the TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug does support dimming features both via the Kasa App and with Alexa. Now, we’re gearing up for next week’s release of the second generation Echo Dot. We’ve pre-ordered a six pack, so Alexa is in every bedroom in addition to our living room and kitchen. We’re going to purchase more TP-Link HS100 Smart Plugs to compliment the Echo Dots. We’ve checked our devices remotely using the simple and intuitive Kasa App. Devices can be turned on and off with just the tap of a power button image. Before you buy, you should note that the TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug works on a 2.4GHz WiFi signal, not a 5GHz signal. We have a dual band. The TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug is large, roughly the width of a pool ball. We’re using our plugs with the Belkin 7-Outlet SurgeMaster Home Series Surge Protector and recommend you use a similar device. (We posted a picture with the TP-Link HS100 plugged directly into the wall, so you can see its size relative to the outlet.)

Doesn't work with non TP-Link hubs,2.0 ,"While this works great for a single use on again off again type of situation, it doesn't seem to mesh well with devices such as the Wink Hub 2 or the Samsung SmartThings hub... (for those into home automation at least). While you can add the functionality to Google Home or the Amazon alternative Alexa, there is no way to perform ""Smart Actions"" without purchasing a TP-Link Hub (SR20). There are no options for accessing through If This Then That, Stringify, or even perform automated tasks using sensors without the TP-Link dedicated Hub. One good thing, you can easily control the power on and off through Google Home for voice control. For full automation you really need a hub, if you look at the supported features of the TP-Link Hub, it's rather lack luster offering only ZigBee or Z-Wave support in comparison to other Hub options. Keep in mind these ""Smart Plugs"" don't even offer either ZigBee or Z-Wave connectivity. I would advise looking into other options if you are considering expanding on an existing hub, or looking into building a SmartHome. I'm going to keep the ones I have... but use them as on/off timers for things like xmas lights and whatnot.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Works Great, Easy to set up. Great experience with first Smart Plug.",5.0 ,"Works for me. Took me about 15 mins to set up 2 mostly because I couldn't remember my wifi password and also connected it to Alexa. Very simple to set up. Just download Kasa app on phone, create an account, connect your smart plug, go back to app, set up new device, put in wifi password and bam you are done connecting and you can control the plug from your phone. To connect to Alexa, go to alexa app, download skill Kasa, log into your Kasa account that you created previously, wait for amazon to pick up the device (hit the search button in Alexa for devices). Make sure if you are connecting a light, name the device in Kasa with a light at the end otherwise you will be saying something like ""Alexa turn on Living Room"" rather than Living Room Light.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Relatively easy to install. It's smart to buy more than one at a time because one will never be enough.,5.0 ,"This was a bit of a pain to get going, but that had more to do with my own failure to follow basic instructions than anything else. Getting a two-pack of these controllers is just smart because it's true that (like tattoos) once you have one, you want more. These are designed so that they will fit in the same outlet. I have one plugged into the same outlet as a Belkin smart plug with no problem. These switches have an on/off button on the side. Installation requires that you download the TP Link Kasa app, which worked fine with my Samsung S7 Edge (though my Norton security is suspicious of it.) Once you go through the registration process and sign in to your WIFI, you are able to control the plug via that app. If you want to control it using Alexa, you need to go to the Alexa app and complete that initialization process. This is where I was having problems because even though I kept reading ""go to your Alexa app"", I kept making it mean ""from the Kasa app"" every time I read it. Once I had my lame ""ah-ha! (you dummy)"" moment, it was easy as 1, 2, 3. After a final discovery routine, it's all hooked up and ready to control by voice. You will need to do this for each plug you install. There is no hub to this system so each plug acts like an island. If you want the fancy colored lights to control with Alexa, you don't need these plugs but you'll have a larger expense springing for the special bulbs and hub such as these: Philips 464479 Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit, 3rd Generation with Richer Colors, Works with Amazon Alexa That is a much more expensive system but it allows you more control over your lighting effects. We have 7 different voice controlled lighting devices now and we love them! We especially love having some of the colored bulbs that require the installation of a hub. We continue to talk about how much our lives are becoming like the Jetsons.

Sure, the set up process will create this for you, and the new one(s) will have the same password(s) as your existing one(s), but your phone/laptop, etc., will need to connect to the new name, and if you move to a different spot in your house, your phone might not automatically switch from one to the other unless the signal cuts out. Printing might be a problem for you, if the printer is wireless on one name and your laptop or phone that you are printing from is on the _EXT name… it all depends on how things are set up. Now, for some commentary: upon opening this new Extender up and taking it out of the box, my son’s first comment (he’s in his early 30s, works in IT like I do), he said, “Wow that is massively ugly. We're gonna need to hide that someplace!” My first attempt to set up this up did not work. It looks like it's easy but like many newer IT things, they are not. It turns out that because I already had 2 extenders in the house, this was trying to re-create the extended networks (“_EXT” ones) with the same names as the other extenders, so that was a conflict. I ended up removing the other 2 extenders to get this to work Set your expectations accordingly, this is not great but OK, could be fun, but my other 2 extenders were easier to get working. Those didn’t have the “smart plug” so I decided to try and get this new one working. Note, the “smart plug” is just an outlet in the unit that you can turn on and off using an app on your phone (the app is called, KASA). The Amazon Echo with Alexa can connect to this using TPLink’s KASA app, and then you can say, “Alex, turn on the ‘plug’” (you can call ‘plug’ anything, so if you put a Christmas Tree into the “smart plug” then you can use the app on your phone, or if you have the echo and if you set the echo up to work with this you can then say, “Alexa, turn on the Christmas Tree” (there is also a button on the unit that you can press to turn the plug on/off) One of the downsides of this plug is that the unit is so big that no matter which of the 2 outlets on your wall plate that you plug this into, it will block the other too. So your 2 outlet wall plate just becomes one “smart” one. As we were trying to find a place to put this thing, to help some of the weak spots in our house where the basic WIFI does not cover well, I put it in the kitchen and my son said, “yeah put it there - what a big eyesore” as he laughed at me and it. (He was being helpful too, but he was also calling it like he/we saw it) In my house, I have a WIFI router with both 2.4 and 5 GHz networks and this will expend them both, creating 2 more networks, one for the 2.4 and one for the 5 GHz networks, so MyWIFI2.4 and MyWIFI5 become MyWIFI2.4_EXT and MyWIFI5_EXT. I noticed that the extender started to complain that it was too far away from the Router. This was odd, because I tried to put this in the same locations where I had my other 2 extenders that worked fine. This was all frustrating, because even with the Extender 15 feet away in direct line of sight to the router, I kept getting the message, too far away, signal too weak. After much trial and error, I turned off the 5GHz extended network (I left the router’s 5GHZ one) and then the thing was happy. Then, I tried to connect my Amazon Echo with Alexa to this. This became very frustrating; much much trial and error… sure, the instructions were straight forward, but something was not working. I can’t tell you how many times I ended up resetting the Extender, and reinstalling it all to try and make all of this work (8-10 times maybe!). I even tried creating a new KASA account (that’s the thing that Alexa actually connects to), but with the new account, it told me that the unit was owned by another account, LOL, so that didn’t work. I finally got the “KASA” skill enabled on the Echo, but then it needs to discover the extender, and it just was not finding it. I was about to give up, so I left it for a few hours, and then came back. There must've been something wrong with the Kasa-server or something, who knows, but the Echo finally discovered the Extender later in the day… AND then it worked with Alexa. Wow, that was a pain. By the way, the first time you try and use the smart plug, it takes quite a while but subsequent times it's faster but not instant. The Smart plug makes a click sound when it goes on and off, annoying. You can use the Kasa app to turn off the button’s light on the Extender unit if that little light bothers you. See the picture, the handle on this thing is the antennae and yes, it needs to be up to work.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Unfortunately after messing with them for a week their only real use is as a paperweight,1.0 ,"Easy to program/setup and were operational in very short order. UPDATE: Problem is that after approximately 10 minutes they are no longer accessible and will only operate manually. Have reprogrammed them numerous times, using different wifi links only to have the same thing happen over and over again. An additional issue is that they do not have a manual (advanced) mode where you can program a static ip, so they use one of your DHCP addresses. Their inability to maintain a connection (or connectivity, whatever the case) makes them paperweights, even when using the KASA application to program and control. The error you get is ""Device Unreachable. Your deice may be powered off or out of network range."" Of course they are powered by being plugged in (doesn't matter if it is a wall outlet or a power strip) and the blue link lights on each of them is solid.

"Nice design, but poor execution",2.0 ,"I really like the option to extend my home network with a simple device like this one. We have a strong network in our home, but the signal gets a little fuzzy when we get out to our garage. So, I was looking forward to using this extender out there to boost the signal. Unfortunately, I ran into some problems with the extender retaining a steady signal to the internet. I would connect and then my phone would mysteriously disconnect from the extended network. Or, my phone would stay connected, but the extended network would not have an internet connection. There was even one point where the network was showing up, but the app wasn't connecting to the device. I don't know if this is user error or if the device is lacking support, but it's virtually unusable in its current state. I do like the design of the extender and its extreme ease of use during the set up, but I just can't give it a higher ranking right now because of the lack of connection.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Not able to set up remote access - Problem solved! (in spite of KASA useless/terrible tech support),3.0 ,"I am updating my previous review, and, leaving it here following this update, in order that it might help someone else if they happen to have the same problem I encountered. I increased my star rating to a 3 from a 1, and it might have been a 5 had I not had this issue to start; (negative 1 star is still appropriate for customer service, they are useless). I solved the problem described in the previous review, by going back to a basic computer & app troubleshooting approach: I 'deleted' the device from the KASA app on my phone, restarted my phone, and added the plug again to the app; I did not have to unplug the plug, first. Problem solved. Wish I had tried that first, but hope it helps someone else, if they encounter this problem. the following is my first review: "" I don't know if I received a returned item or not - I followed all the steps in the KASA app, and can turn it on and off via my phone, no problem - but then.... I tried to set it up for remote access, and got a message ""the device is bound to another user account .... you can perform factory reset to remove account association"" - what???!!! User support is terrible. chat and hotmail. They said that I needed to 'unbind' the account. And, it will take a few days! I was asked to give them all this info: "" We need the S/N number and MAC address of your plug, and please provide us the username for your TP-LINK cloud account and your region. We will unbind it on our cloud server. Then you can bind it to your account."" Isn't this ridiculous?? The 'hotline' support agent said I could download a fix for the app from the website, but had to do it from my pc. without any explanation as to why. I'm guessing it has something to do with my router?? she sent me a link, guess I'll try it.""","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Easy setup and works well with Alexa.,4.0 ,"setup on this smart plug is as easy as it gets. Just follow these steps: * Just plug the device into a socket * download the Kasa app * open the app * allow the app to discover the smart plug * Give the discovered smart plug a meaningful name * Done. If you want to setup the smart plug with Alexa, open the Alexa app, then just add the skill. Setting my schedules is also a breeze. * Click on the custom name of the smart plug you setup earlier * Click on Schedule * Click on ""+"" on top right * set time, then action (on/off) and repeating days of the week * save and repeat There are also scenes where you can setup the smart plug to dim the lights for, and group smart plugs to turn on/off, etc. I have yet to play with those features. Now, on some less appealing stuff... * Smart plug is bulky. If you plug it onto the bottom of a two outlet socket, you will not be able to use the top socket. * remote control (outside of your LAN) has a noticeable delay, but the SYN establishment from LAN to WAN allows you to control your smart plugs without any type of port forwarding on router/FW. Overall, I would recommend this smart plug, but if the HS105 behaves the same as the HS100, I would recommend it over this model as that does not hinder the use of neighboring socket.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"""Thumbs Up!""",4.0 ,"I love these smart plugs. They are easy to setup and work great with the echo dot. Just keep in mind the plugins do require a 3-prong outlet. However, if you don't have one, you can buy outlet adapters if you need them. I bought a pack of three from Walmart for a $1.97. Also, the adapters can be used to extend your smart plug out some, in order make room for something to be plugged in underneath it. Although my outlets are 3-pronged, I still had to use an adapter in order to plug in my Echo Dot, below it. However, do note that an adapter is not necessary; if, you're plugging in a smaller, normal sized plug, below it.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Happy Customer - But Please Make Them Smaller,4.0 ,"I am happy with these smart plugs. I now have 5: 1 controlling a window AC and the other 4 controlling lights. They were all easy to set up and add to Alexa. The first two I purchased had the energy monitoring. That feature is nice for the small window AC that I have running in a renovated attic that does not get as cool as the rest of the house with just the central AC. I do not find the power consumption feature worth the extra cost for lights that at most run a couple of hours a day. I love the schedule feature, especially for the little AC as it does not have any timer built in and runs non-stop unless you manually turn it off. Turning on my lights by voice with Alexa is awesome, and I no longer have to reach over and turn out a light once snuggled into bed (yeah - warning - these things can make you lazy). Being able to turn on a light remotely is another great feature. I can be at girl's night and turn on the living lamp for the dogs, or turn on the lights, so I do not have to walk into a dark house. My only complaint with these devices is the size. They are not outlet friendly if you have other grounded or transformer style power cords. I had to purchase adjustable power strips where I was using the plug with other electrical items. If TP-Link could redesign these so you weren't losing half of your outlet, I would give them 5 stars.​","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

"Works very well, kinda' bulky",4.0 ,"I like these. Works well even in my unheated garage plus another in an outdoor weatherproof box, even when it's 10 below to turn on/off the roof de-icer cables plugged into them. The Kasa app is fairly reliable, rare that it loses it's connection to my network. Network connection is tricky the first time, but once you understand the process it's actually quick & easy to add more devices. Devices can be grouped, and controlled by the app or Alexa. Name your group, add specific devices, and all in the group are controlled by a single command. So (for example) I'm upstairs and say Alexa, ""downstairs on"", 2 lamps, TV, AVR and cable box in the family room all start up. I walk down the stairs with a plate & beverage and don't need to reach for a light switch or stumble in the dark. My AV system is also tied to a Logitech Harmony Remote, it all works very well together. My one gripe is that it is way too bulky... why in the world does it need to partially block the outlet below it? I can barely squeeze in a small plug down there but most things won't fit with it. Make the circle around the outlet portion to be the very bottom of this device, and then push all the rest of it if need be into the upper part of the housing. Much smaller in EVERY dimension would make this much more usable.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Convenient For Simple On-Off Power Control via Alexa or App,4.0 ,"This TP-Link Smart Plug is another useful device from the TP-Link company. I've used many TP-Link products over the years, particularly routers, and have been impressed with the quality and ease of use of their products. I also have their Smart Bulbs, that work consistently well in comparison to several other competitors' smart bulbs i've tried, and this Smart Plug, like my TP-Link bulbs, is easily controlled by Alexa. This TP-Link Smart Plug is easy to set up. You download TP-Link's ""Kasa"" app to your smartphone, sign-up for an account, and follow the simple directions. As some reviewers have noted, the on-app instructions are much more thorough and take you by the hand, in comparison to the short instruction paperwork included in the box. You plug this Smart Plug into an outlet and pair w your home network by following the instructions shown. If you've paired other smart devices into your home, this will be old hat. If you have not, you'll find the directions on your app simple, short and understandable. The Kasa app itself is basic, but functional- you add and name each smart device, and in the case of this Smart Plug, you control the on/off power capability from your phone, to include simple scheduling (turn on every M, W and F at 7am, etc...) and timing (turn off after 1 min to 23 hours). The power button over the plug outlet, which glows green when the power is set to ON, can also be manually toggled as an on/off switch by pressing. As a wi-fi range extender, you can see total clients on your network, connection speeds, the name of the network they are on, and network details such as the uplink signal strength and speed at the 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz options. If you already have TP-Link smart devices and a Kasa account, you simply add your new Smart Plug to your existing devices. To add Alexa functionality, you need an Amazon Alexa device of course, and the Alexa app. After you've set up the TP-Link Smart Plug to work within the Kasa app, you need to ensure you press the Smart Plug icon (or whatever icon pic you choose for this smart plug), go to the Settings, and enable ""Remote Control."" You then goto the Alexa app and enable the Kasa app in ""Skills"" and link to your Kasa account (you need to have signed up for a Kasa account- you can't just be using as a Guest). You then press Alexa app's ""Smart Home"" area, ""Devices,"" and at the bottom of your devices, press ""Discover Devices."" This should show you your newly added TP-Link Smart Plug (if you already have Kasa set up in Alexa due to other Kasa devices, this Smart Plug will show up automatically). You can then make voice command to Alexa to control your Plug. Writing this out sounds a lot more complex than it is- it's not too difficult to make this work in real life w a few caveats: it's critical to ensure that you have the most recent Kasa firmware and Alexa updates for your apps. The older Alexa app won't work w Kasa, as I found out by calling TP-Link's 24-7 available customer service line. They were helpful and quickly resolved the problem. Very good customer service. Overall, I'm pleased with this Plug, that adds smart home functionality to my ""not-smart"" devices, and there is no hub required. The main reason I deducted a star, is that this plug takes up a full outlet (you can't use the second plug on standard wall outlets) and it is very bulky in design, sticking fairly far out of your wall. I am also not too impressed with the wi-fi extension capability, as it does not seem to improve my speeds in an appreciable manner in the more remote areas of my home where I tried setting this up. Still, it's pretty useful for being an Alexa controlled power outlet. btw, some not-smart devices you may have, which contain auto-off features in the event of power outages or disruptions, will not work with this plug just due to their own internal fail-safes. This is not a criticism of this Smart Plug, just an observation that may irritate you when you notice that many of your devices will not just turn back on when power is restored.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Off to a good start,5.0 ,"I have no idea how long these plugs will last but the first couple of weeks have been trouble-free. I am using these with an Amazon Echo via the Kasa software and they work really work together. I tell Echo to turn on the light and the light goes on almost immediately. In fact, the Echo says ""OK"" when you ask it to turn on the light, but the light is already on by the time she says it. The plugs are going to take one outlet space and cover up the other one (in a two-socket plate), but I bought a pack of those short extension cords that Amazon sells and freed the second socket. Home automation is still developing and will be much more reliable in a few years, but this is a pretty good device in terms of current consumer-level products.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Useful Device, Easy to Setup",4.0 ,"The installation is straightforward and worked without a hitch. There was a problem with the Kasa app on the iPad mini. One input field obscured another input field making installation selections difficult. Setting up the Amazon Echo (Alexa) interface was equally easy. This enables one to switch the device by voice command without having to go to the Kasa app. Once it has been setup one can program the device to switch it at various times (including sunrise and sunset), with different settings for each day of the week. There does not appear to be a practical limit to the number of settings. One can also set it to Away mode, in which it will switch randomly to simulate occupancy of the premises. There are three features i would like to see added. The first is an override switch. It would be great if one could press a physical button on the device to switch it. If the phone or iPad is not at hand and Alexa is in another room, there is no easy way to switch the device. The second nice to have feature would be the ability to interface it with the Canary. This would have the effect of being able to switch a light on when motion is detected. The third relates to switching at sunset or sunrise (a great feature to have). It would be nice if one were able to add or subtract some time and not be confined to the actual sunset and sunrise times. If i had it to do over again i would buy this again.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
VERY easy setup; w/ Alexa these plugs can do wonders!,5.0 ,"I started out by purchasing 2 of these to control standalone lamps in my master bedroom and home office/den. I quickly used the Krasa app to add them to my network, then in less than 60 seconds I used my Alexa app and connected these to my Amazon Echo system, which now consists of 3 echo dots, 1 regular echo, and a new Echo Show. I then bought 2 more to connect my living room main light and an additional lamp. Flash forward to this year with the onset of the Christmas season. Because I go all out for Christmas, decorating my entire downstairs and part of the upstairs, I had one goal in mind—to control ALL of my Christmas lights on both levels through my Echoes and dots, which means going through my Krasa app. To accomplish this, I purchased a few more of these smart plugs in the 2-packs (which are slightly cheaper than buying them individually). I used the Krasa app to add them to my current setup, gave them a short name so I'd know which was which, then I used the Alexa app to discover them all. I presently have 8 of these around the house in various places, with Christmas lights, animated figurines, even my main Christmas tree all plugged into these smart plugs. I did this with the help of extension cords and a power strip that are used to accept the plugs of all the aforementioned lights and figurines, etc. The power strips are at the end of the chain and get plugged into the TP Link mini-plug. Then on the Alexa app I place all of these mini-plugs into one group entitled, quite simply, ""Christmas lights."" When I want to turn them on, I now simply say, ""Alexa, turn on Christmas lights,"" and instantly, all the lights, figurines, and the Christmas tree are on. I use a similar command to turn them all off. No more running around to all the different outlets, bending down, maneuvering around tight spots or Christmas decorations that are placed to hide the outlets, plugging and unplugging everything. My entire house can now be all controlled with one command to Alexa. I should point out that for me, the setup of these mini-plugs to my Wi-Fi network took less than 1 minute per plug, if that; and connecting them to my Krasa app (the app used with these devices) also took less than 1 minute. Ditto for getting them set up in the Alexa app. Total for each device's complete, individual setup was about 2 to 3 minutes. Final but very important note here: if you have an old Wi-Fi router or a weak signal in some parts of your residence, the latter of which is common if your router is placed a bit of a distance from your mini-plugs, you will probably experience connection issues when trying to set up or use these devices. In all seriousness, if you're going to even have an Echo or Dot, you really ought to seriously consider spending the money to upgrade your Wi-Fi router, and this might include buying a setup like the Netgear Orbi, which is THE best system to give you powerful and strong Wi-Fi in a large home of 3 stories, for example. Extenders aren't that good. The Orbi is uniquely different. My Wi-Fi router is a year old, has 4 antennas on it, runs all the wireless bands, and was placed by me in the center of my house, providing a very strong signal to all my various devices, of which there are plenty. Lastly, it's also good to have a reliable and fast Internet service. After having Comcast for so long, where I had their fastest service at the time, when I moved into my newly constructed house in summer 2016, I went a different route. Comcast was wired for my new subdivision, but they didn't even realize it! Because they argued with me about this, telling me they couldn't provide more than 100 megs download and 25 megs upload, I decided to go with AT&T, which had installed fiber optic lines along their entire paths. They hooked me up right when I moved in, and I'm getting 1GB download AND upload on my wired main PC, while I'm getting anywhere from 700 to 900 megs download and 700 to 900 megs upload on my wireless connections (wireless will always be a bit slower than wired). This absolutely blows away Comcast, and at a lower price! More importantly, however, these speeds provide for far more reliability and performance with my TP Link smart plugs and smart bulbs, which I also have.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Manually they work fine. The Schedule funtion has a mind of its own...,3.0 ,"It works great manually but it's the oddest thing on a schedule. Sometimes the light will come on/go off at the proper time. Sometimes the light will come on an hour later. Sometimes it doesn't come on/go off at all. There's no rhyme or reason to why. It's not the same device each time. I also have a Smart Plug along with these 2 Smart Plug Minis and the same thing: the scheduling is unreliable. I attempted to get technical help through the web site chat. But the poor interaction (rep didn't seem to understand what I was saying) and the long minutes I had to wait between each reply by the rep told me I was dealing with someone who was 1) following a script so no true knowledge of the product, 2) wasn't proficient in English, or 3) was handling many chats at the same time. By themselves each of these situations doesn't give me confidence. If the issue is 2 or all 3 then even worse. The app gives me messages that I would like to know why they appeared, but the instructions and site don't list them. One switch sometimes says ""Local Only"" with the little Google Maps pin next to it. Why it appears then goes away, I don't know. But why would this cause a problem with the scheduled tasks? Aren't those stored inside the plug itself? If I haven't lost power or my WiFi signal, shouldn't they follow the schedule properly? They are on the correct time zone, so the hour delay in coming on shouldn't be happening, and it doesn't happen every night. Is there something on my router I could adjust to help communications perhaps? All my other devices on my network are connecting fine. I will gladly raise my rating if someone can give me tips on fixing this, or why it is happening. Otherwise, manually operating them without an problem get them 3 stars.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
A smart home solution that actually works and is very simple ...,5.0 ,"Finally! A smart home solution that actually works and is very simple to install and use. I've gone through a significant number of other devices like this (Wemo, Insteon with HomeSeer and others) and had difficulties with reliability. The Insteon devices sometimes worked, but not reliably. Plus, using these devices with one of the many hub hardware/software options expensive and has usability and maintenance troubles of its own. If you're a techie with deep pockets and lots of free time, and a very patient spouse, these might be OK. The TPLink Smart family of devices are so reliable and easy to use it is almost unbelievable. I have the wall switches, bulbs and smart plugs and all work perfectly. The remote functionality works fine over my Verizon Home Wireless router (no issues with needing incoming connections, port forwarding or other ugliness of this sort). I'm using the Android Kasa app, and have not encountered any issues at all with it. The scene support is fairly basic (allows you to group a number of commands/devices into one user action, e.g. ""arriving at my home"" turn on lights""), but sufficient for my needs. I use this with Google Assistant and it works great. One suggestion: it would be nice if there was a more elegant way to manage/control multiple homes.

Terrific set of smart plugs,5.0 ,"I own many brands of these smart plugs, and this one is well-designed.

Resetting it when you change routers or WiFi networks doesn't bring you to tears, either, like some other brands (looking at you, WeMo). And, of course, it works seamlessly with Alexa.

Flawless Modern Solution,4.0 ,"I purchased these with the interest of doing an update to my old fashioned (but super reliable) Intermatic lamp timer. September to November is the time of year that it starts getting dark much earlier and almost weekly it seems we are losing another 15 minutes of sunshine, so every 30 days I am making adjustments to the Intermatic. After having to crawl under the lamp table for the last 7 or 8 years to adjust the timer, I was hoping to make things a little simpler by just using the HS100 and an app. Out of the box and set up for me was super simple. I think it took a maximum of 10 minutes to have the HS100 up and running. Download the Kasa app, follow some simple steps and it is ready to plug and play. I am using a Apple Airport Extreme router for my WiFi. The HS100 uses 802.11b/g/n for WiFi at 2.4GHz. It would be nice to have the option to have the newer 5GHz and 802.11 AC, but everything is working fine so this is just a small detail. Before I plugged the new smart plug in to use with the lamp I did a few tests to see how much electricity it will draw and if there is a substantial difference in use between it and the old timer. I am super happy to report the HS100 actually uses about 75% less electricity (.07 watts) when in the off position and about 25% less when on (1.6 watts) versus the Intermatic (2.1 watts). I do find it interesting that the HS100 draws additional electricity when turned on but it is still less than the Intermatic. I attached a few photos to this review to show examples. I used the smart plug for a full 30 days before writing this review and it has worked excellent with zero issues. I love being able to get in the app to adjust the time or to just turn the light on or off. It would be nice if the size was smaller but as technology evolves I am sure we will get very compact smart plugs in the future.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
WAY BETTER than WeMo. Works great with ECHO.,5.0 ,"Pros: Works way better than WeMo. Enough said? Setup is way easier and less buggy. Resetting is easy and fast, unlike WeMo. If you use Alexa, these never have an issue and do not lose connectivity. The Alexa skill is flawless now. Mixed: Setup sometimes freezes but it's quick and easy to reset. Once it's connected, it's all good. Cons: Kasa is a buggy app when used to turn lights on and off BUT if you connect it to Echo it will have zero problems. Just don't use the app, and strictly use Echo and you won't have any issues with losing connection. Maybe an app update will fix the problem but the problem is exclusively with the IOS and Android Kasa App. The Alexa skill for Kasa works perfectly and consistently.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Can't wait for the bugs to be fixed, so good bye.",1.0 ,"So, I bought bought a 2-pack and loved them. Connected them to Alexa and life was easy and decided to buy 3 more. One night they weren't working...Alexa was not talking to them and I could not get the app to work. Things were fixed later that night with a sincere email apology from TP Link. But then in the past few days, Alexa has not been able TP Link's (Kasa app). The devices are not even discoverable. They can only be controlled with the app. I find out that its happening to to everyone from the comments and reviews. At this point, I was kinda fed up. So I decided to return what I can. Was able to return 3 of the 5. Maybe some day, TP Link will straighten things out and my first two won't just site in its box. If so, I would fully recommend their products. It's nice not to need to buy a separate hub or bridge to make them work.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Good product, but 1 smart plug blocks 2-plug outlets completely",4.0 ,"I have 3 of these now. My only complains is the space below the outlet (where you plug into). It sticks too far down, so if you ever put one of these on a 2-plug outlet, both plugs will be blocked. This can be really annoying. It's so close, that you can really force and jam a second plug below it, but they both aren't plugged in completely, looks cluttered, and can be a bit dangerous when doing so. Aside from that, I love the Alexa interconnectivity. It does what it's meant to do and can learn fairly difficult words. I have it plugged into a light-up pumpkin for halloween and was able to create the command ""Alexa, turn the pumpkin on"". Very cool. My friends all think it's ridiculous haha.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Easy to set up. Does seem to lose connection if the power goes out.,4.0 ,"Pros: It does extend the wireless network. You can use this and then have multiple devices controlled by Alexa (all plugged into the same strip though). Do not need a hub. The fold up antenna does seem to extend the range. Can turn your stuff on and off from anywhere. Was easy to set up and get working with the Kasa app and with Alexa. Cons: It takes up both your outlets IF you want to use something with a wide plug, I got around this by putting a short extension cord (one foot) on it, but then I have this large device that is on the floor. You can get a smaller plug in to the other outlet if you put this device on the top plug. Over the course of using it for 10 days it lost connection and had to be reset twice. Once I will give it a pass, as the power went out (and I had to reset it after the power came back on). Since the only way I have figured out how to get it to reset is to unplug it, I have to pull out the furniture each time. Since it is thick and then you plug the plug in the front you may have to have your furniture farther out from the wall.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Can't Beat These!!,5.0 ,"I use TP-Link smart plugs and smart bulbs in my set up with Alexa using wifi and the Alexa app to give me remote voice control. These particular Smart Plugs are a big improvement over the original models that take up a whole 2 outlet plugin because they only take up the outlet they're using leaving the other plug free for other use. They're easy to use and to program using their KASA app and it's nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on the ice machine which sits on the bar and only uses the icemaker plug to control on and off and the outlet in is a hard to reach location and she does it. I use them for other devices around the house as well and with the Alexa compatibility and simplicity of set up with my router I highly recommend them primarily because they're independently usable without any hub once connected to your wifi. You might want to consider their Smart Bulbs too because they don't require a hub either. I have them throughout the house and aside from having to come up with a different name for each set or individual bulb, they're a breeze to use as well. Five Stars and I already know they last, my smart bulbs are going on a year and a half right now, the plugins are closing in on a year. I highly recommend.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
These Plugs are great!!,5.0 ,"I have one connected to a standing fan and another connected to my lava lamp. When ever I travel and forget to turn off the lamp I can do it from the app. I also turn it on about 30 minutes before I come home to get the lava flowing. ITs been great for the standing fan as well in the summer where I set it to a schedule and turns on to cool my bedroom down or when I'm lazy in bed and its too cold I just use the app to turn off the fan. I also purchased the LB120 and have that on a schedule to turn on and off and can change the color from daylight to soft white. My next project is to replace light switches where I cant put LB120 smart light blubs with TP Link HS200 switches :) I have them all linked to Alexa and created groups too where I can turn them on or off. I can say Alexa turn on bedroom and it will turn on the LB120, fan, and lava lamp. Or, Alexa turn on lights and it will turn on the LB120 and lava lamp. Or I can say turn on fan and it will just turn on the fan. I can officially transform in to a couch potato once I reach home! I was going to get the Wemo switches and plugs but as soon a I saw they were a Belkin product I stayed far away.

Smart Plugs for Dummies,5.0 ,"This is a review for the TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug 2-Pack. If you're looking for an easy to use smart plug, I can fully recommend the TP-Link. Installing the plug is easy. Just plug it into an outlet (it's a 3-prong with a ground), let the lights flash a couple times to activate the WiFi, download the Kasa app for your Android or iOS device, and add a device to the Kasa app. If you already have TP-Link devices connected to your home network via the Kasa app, the set-up is even easier as you won't have to input your router's password each time. You only have to enter it for the first device you connect. The plug itself is a little bulky, and the plug doesn't rotate in the outlet, so it's possible that it will block a couple outlets on a surge protector strip. But for hooking up something like a floor lamp, or indoor christmas tree lights, this thing is awesome. The best thing I can say about the TP-Link smart home devices, is that they seem to ""just work."" I haven't had any connectivity issues. Once it's set up on my router and set up to be controlled by my Echo, it always works. I haven't had to reset the devices or bulbs, or reconnect them to my router. The app allows me to easily group devices to turn them on and off at once, or to add timers to them (again, great for interior christmas tree lights). The only negative I possibly have is that I don't know about the cyber security of these TP-Link devices. You can turn off the remote control via the internet while you're out of your house so the devices are hid behind your router's firewall. But if they're only hooked up to floor lamps and such, I can't see it being too much of a problem. Overall, the TP-Link bulbs and this Smart Plug reliably work via the well-designed Kasa app and with an Echo. I'm actually hoping TP-Link expands it's line and starts making BR30 flood lights and other Kasa controlled devices too.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Very reliable and easy to use.,5.0 ,"While similarly priced. These are better than the WeMo. I want the option to voice control via Alexa (which WeMo also has) as well as using the actual wall switch for my idiot family that always comes and forgets ""never touch the switches in my house"" so that it will still work as expected for them. With TPLINK, the default state is ""ON"". So if the lamp that is connected to it is already on and you flip the wall switch off (for some houses that will cut the power to the outlet) the lamp will turn off, and when you flip the wall switch up and restore power, the lamp will come back on as expected. With WeMo, the default state is ""OFF"". So if the light is on and you flip the wall switch cutting the power, the light goes off. but when you flip the switch back on , the light will remain off.

"Smart home is fun, even if you're in the Matrix",5.0 ,"My girlfriend gave me two of these b/c she didn't like them (Because she didn't take time to learn how to use them.) Basically: 1. These plugs have a mini wifi hot spot. You connect your phone to it to configure them to talk to your wifi hotspot. 2. The smart plugs then connect to your home Wifi. 3. From there, Alexa (Amazon Echo) 'discovers' them and you can stay things like ""Turn the heat up"" or ""Turn on the bedroom light"". 4. Can manage them from anywhere on earth (Not that you need.) You can use the Kasa app to manage them all OR, the Alexa device. In Kasa, you can group devices into sets of devices. I called my group ""Turn all the lights"" and when I add ""Off"" when talking to Alexa, she turns all the lights off. They're programmable down to the minute off or on as many times a day as you want. It's nice to not come home to an empty dark house and have them shut off at around bed time.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"A bit chunky, but otherwise very good.",4.0 ,"For a parent with a baby that is awake every few hours to feed, I don't know why I waited so long to buy this darn thing! For someone who isn't tech-savvy, the installation was a breeze and fast ... even for a new parents with little to no sleep in the past 2.5 months. We got this for the nursery lamp in our bedroom so that when I get up to breastfeed, I don't have to walk across the room to turn on the lamp. Now, all I have to do is grab my daughter from the co-sleeper and simply say out loud ""Alexa, turn on the nursery lamp"". It's almost as simply as plug-and-play. The installation direction is very easy to follow - but I'll give you a summary. First, you will need to download a Kasa app - this is not avoidable. From the Kaza app, you can connect the plug to your home wifi, and everything is connected within minutes. You can then connect this to Alexa by going to the Alexa app on your phone. This device also allows you to set schedule for it to be turned on and off at a certain time or turning it on and off via the Kasa app - great if you are going to be away from home! CON - The plug is a bit chunky. After this is plugged in, it render the bottom plug of my 2 plug outlet completely useless because it blocks half of it. Hence, one star was taken away. This is a pretty bad con because plugs are like gold these day with all the electronic devices. I have to now move my humidifier across the room to a different plug because the existing 2-plug outlet can only be used for one of these smart plug instead.

Plugination,5.0 ,"I have had not a single issue with these (HS100 2-pack). Very easy to connect using the Kasa app. They work great and stay connected. The Kasa app is intuitive and extremely dependable. The fact that Kasa works with Amazon Echo is a huge plus. I have used one of these outlets for a compressor that I have mounted up high in my garage. I tell Alexa to turn on my compressor and voila, I'm cooking with gas. Before using this outlet, I had to just plug and unplug the power cable to the compressor. I have since purchased the HS110 w/energy monitoring and I like them even better. They are just as dependable and it's nice to have the energy monitoring. I would like for the energy monitoring app to have a little more to it, but you get the basic numbers; enough to know current usage, last 7 days, and last 30 days. But, don't plan on storing information, or going beyond the 30 days unless you take screen shots and keep track of dates yourself.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Easiest set up ever, and great for lights/lamps",5.0 ,"I love these plugs for both lamps AND things like my flat iron (that I frequently forget to unplug). I can easily turn lights on before I get home, or if I just want to make it look like someone's home when they're not. I also love that I can set a timer if I know I'm going to be busy & won't be able to manually turn them on while I'm out. These things are amazing. I have 3 already & plan to get a few more. Pros: - Took 60 seconds to set up, very easy - Works really well with the Amazon Echo/Alexa (again, took about 60 seconds to set up) - Great app that can be used remotely to turn outlet off/on (perfect for lamps so I can turn them on/off while I'm out, can also set a timer if you don't want to do it manually) Cons: - Once or twice, the app has had a glitch & I couldn't access it away from home.

Great set of smart plus,4.0 ,I really enjoy these general smart plugs. It would have been 5 stars if the TP-Link server to Alexa was not down at times. Since you mostly control the lights and switches using voice and Alexa it is irritating when the Alexa to TP link server is down. happened twice in a two week period. But recommend this for sure. You won't regret the ease of use and voice control. With the Alexa connection the setup of groups of smart plugs is even better. Great value! I purchased several of these. Setup is easy and done in minutes. Also one downside was that the App mentioned in the mini manual points to stuff that doesn't exist.

Great with one hiccup,5.0 ,"The actual plugs worked great with Alexa. The one issue I had with this product was the set-up which was pretty intuitive except for one thing they don't tell you ahead of time. You'll get stuck in a ""can't find plug"" loop halfway through set-up unless you change some settings on your phone/tablet. Be sure to switch back to your usual settings once you've got your plugs set up. So, here's my hint: 1. First, download the Kasa app to your phone or tablet. 2. Go to your wifi settings on your phone/tablet and disable the auto search feature. 3. Connect to the TP-Link wifi which will appear on your list of available wifi. 4. Plug in 1 outlet at a time. 5. Wait to get an orange/green flashing light on the plug. 6.

Very good in non-hot locations,4.0 ,"Been using these timers for the past 60 days. Pros: only occupy one outlet, quick and easy connection to home router, Kasa app is very easy to use, multiple settings available down to a minute, can use sunrise and sunset times, easy to check to see if timer is on/off and what the future settings are, easy to turn on/off remotely, programming has been reliable since installed. Each timer is connected to a low wattage device. Cons: Did not realize these have an operating range limit of 104 degrees. One was outside and the day it hit 105 the wifi function stopped working. The timer continues to operate the program that was last input but I have no way to change that. If you plan to use one in a potentially hot location, like in a dry outdoors location or an indoor outlet in So. AZ that gets afternoon sun you might experience the same problem. There are other units with higher ratings.

I love the convenience of controlling lamps/devices by voice command and ...,1.0 ,"I love the convenience of controlling lamps/devices by voice command and this type of plug-in outlet method allows you begin your technological journey without investing in a Hub necessary for a fully integrated Smart Home. My Smart Home conversion began with these 2 plugs, they were my very first purchase and investment. The major downside I failed to predict is that this particular model, due to its perpendicular elongated shape, makes the second outlet within the receptacle completely useless. It is too ‘bulky’, encroaching into the footprint of the lower receptacle and blocking any plug from being inserted. It is a design flaw, a mistake...or perhaps I should refer to it as an early ‘prototype’ not yet tested and rushed into the Consumer Market amid the stampede of competition. Ahhh, retrospect... The most common outlet type in American residences (by law, Building Code, and electrical NEMA standards) is a dual outlet receptacle, aka a covenience outlet. A single outlet is designated for much more power/voltage (washer/dryer, microwave, etc...). Bottom line - these deficiencies have been addressed, just be sure to buy the latest version/model of anything associated with tech. Of course, if you’re maintaining a budget and are willing to ‘McGyver’ your way throught it - by all means, save your cash because this product absolutely works and programming with Alexa & TP’s App Kasa was seamless and simple.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Easy to setup, easy to use. Would be nice not to have to connect to the cloud.",5.0 ,"Easy to setup/use/configure. Just plug it in, use an app, find the devices, configure. Voila! The cloud has great advantages for getting past routers, configuring the devices with ease, etc., but then you are connected to the 'cloud' outside your home. For security reasons, I really don't like that. But so far, it's been stellar! The connectivity is excellent, unlike other TPLink experiences I've had in the past. Having so many devices on WiFi seems like a bad idea, but so little information is transferred, it won't hurt performance on your router/access point. Response is instant, too! Press OFF, it's off, press ON, it's on...no waiting. I did notice a slight delay - 1 second perhaps? - when we were in Canada, connecting to our home in NYC, but... not bad! Looking into getting their cameras, which look interesting. Just don't like having all this access to the inside of my home, and my schedule, somewhere 'up in the cloud.'

Great as a smart plug but average as a range extender,3.0 ,"The TP-Link AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender+ is a home automation device combining the functionalities of a Wi-Fi Range Extender and those of a smart plug. This device is a mixed bag for me. I love the smart plug functions but the range extender functions don't work very well for me. First off, the Range Extender+ is pretty big. If you plug it in a wall duplex outlet, no matter the top or bottom receptacle, it is going to block the other one. Basically, you're going to turn the duplex outlet into a single smart outlet. Secondly, the device has a flip-up antenna that needs to be up for optimal reception, it's going take up some vertical room. Thirdly, the device is thick and deep (about 2.5"") and the smart outlet is in the front, so it's going to take up a lot of room in the when you plug whatever you want to control in the smart outlet. Setup is easy and straight forward with the Kasa app. The app will walk you step by step through the entire process. It is much more detailed and easier to follow than the paper documentation included in the package. The app will prompt you to create a Kasa cloud account. One tip for the advanced users. If your home wireless router uses MAC address filtering, you will have to allow 4 different MAC addresses for the device to work - two for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios and another two for the smart plug. They are not shown in the app, so you will have to temporarily disable MAC address filtering in your wireless router and identify them. The smart plug functions work as advertised. It performs pretty much the same as the TP-Link single-purposed smart plug devices. You can set up power on/off events based on schedules and timers. Only runtime usage information will be shown in the app. There is no energy monitoring information available (would have loved it). The smart plug is compatible with Amazon Echo. You just need to install the Kasa skills and link up your Kasa account. The range extender functions do not work very well for me. I have the SSID's of the range extender set as those of my wireless router with the ""_EXT"" suffix appended (the SSID's are customizable if you want). Both Wi-Fi radios have connected to my wireless router without any problems. I have also set up access control to allow only whitelisted devices to connect to the range extender. I was able to connect my iPhone, PC, Mac and PS4 to the range extender. Everything seemed great until I tried to connect my Xbox One, which was the main purpose for the use of the range extender since the Xbone One is located at the far end of the house. The Xbox One would be able to associate with the range extender but not to get an IP address from the DHCP server which was the wireless router. Restarting both the router and range extender would not fix the problem. For reasons unknown to me, the Xbox One is a no go on this range extender. It works with my old TP-Link single-band range extender though. Another drawback is that there is no user-selectable operation modes for the range extender. Some range extenders can operate in WDS, AP only, bridge and client modes. Nothing about these in the range extender's web GUI. Though you can use the range extender as a wireless adapter for a device without a wireless interface, such as your blu-ray players, etc. The access control function uses a single whitelist or blacklist for both radios, so you can't customize them differently. All in all, I would probably give 3 stars for the range extender functions and 4 stars for the smart plug functions of the Range Extender+. It is easy to install and set up with the Kasa app. The smart plug functions work great. Not so for the range extender functions though. While it works with most of my wireless devices, it doesn't seem to play nice with my Xbox One, so it's a show stopper for me.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Solid entry-level smart plug,3.0 ,"Solid entry-level smart plug. I bought two of these when I first starting out on home automation because they were a good way to get my feet wet. In hindsight, I should have paid more another brand - but I only discovered this once I got deeper into automation. TP-Link does offer a nice entry level way to get into home automation, but the lack of IFTTT channel integration is pretty significant if you're going to use that at all (and I suggest you do if you're automating). TP-Link has stated IFTTT integration will be coming, but it's unclear when (technically you can workaround this with some coding, but it's not exactly the easiest thing to do). Because I wanted IFTTT on other devices I now have a mix of brands, which I'm not wild about (different apps when you're remote). These also are large plugs - which is the case with the cheaper plugs (and something I knew when buying these), but it still is part of something to consider. Buy a cheap 1 foot wall extender and that will take care of the blocking the plug problem. The App works well on the plus side. PROS: -Cheap -App is great -Works well with Amazon Echo -Easy set up -No drop outs/loss of connection issues CONS: -Large (buy a 1 foot cord extender if you want to use both plugs) -No IFTTT Overal - solid plugs if you're getting into it, but I'd suggest spending up for IFTTT-enabled plugs, and smaller plugs.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"These are ok, I have purchased several of these and several other brands and all of them are ok, but I find them difficult to ge",5.0 ,"These are ok, I have purchased several of these and several other brands and all of them are ok, but I find them difficult to get them to integrate and install easily. I am sure eventually it will be almost automatic, but it isn't. I have a friend that I bought some of these so they could use them with Alexa, and they have an iPhone. So, I don't know anything about an iPhone, and it took forever to get them to work. I real pain in the ass. So, all of these hubs need to get a great deal better to use. Also, I wonder about security issues with these items. There is NO security features on them, and I wonder down the road someone can use them as a back door into my home network. Not addressing this is another issue, that shows these type of things are still new and needs more work. Now that everyone is getting on board with AI in their homes, then I feel this type of item will become more popular and with that competition for you to buy this brand over that brand, etc. I wouldn't even be surprised that Amazon or Google ends up purchasing one of these companies. For me the AIs are really good to have if you use them to control things. I have a room air conditioner upstairs in my bedroom that I can tell my AI to turn off or on. I also have a heater in my bedroom that I can control easily. I can turn my bedroom lights on before I go upstairs, thus lighting my way, and then once I get into bed, I don't have to reach over and turn a my bedroom light off, I just tell Alexa to do it. Eventually I feel you will buy an Alexa or a Google Home and you will get several hubs, designed to easily just plug in and connect to Alexa or Google Home and configure onto your smartphone in a matter of seconds. It somewhat reminds me how difficult it was initially to get bluetooth to talk with anything. Now it connects almost instantly. Also, size is a factor here. I had to get several different electrical strips because these things take up so much room. Eventually that will drop down. I can imagine that eventually you will see wall plugs that have this type of connectivity built right in them.

Still, 4 stars instead of 5 because it should have worked the first time around saving me a couple hours frustration. In the end, the devices work perfectly. I can control the plugs not only through the wifi network I'm on, but from anywhere I have an internet connection on my phone. And it's nice to say, ""Alexa, turn on the red lamp."" But I realized that I have very few devices that plug into a wall that I would ever want Alexa to turn on or off. Most of my lights are controlled by a wall switch (other TP-Link devices screw into a bulb base). And the device must come on automatically when power is lost for these plugs to work with them. My window air conditioners, on losing power, do not come on automatically; in fact they reset to 73 degrees and stay off. ORIGINAL REVIEW: After two hours of setup failing time and time again, I gave up. The first problem is that you need to install the TP-Link app on your cell phone or tablet. And the app wants your location and access to your files. And you need to link your email and verify the email address before the app will work. The app saw both plugs (I guess through a private network), but it could not see my home network. First, it chose a neighbor's wifi without asking if it was the correct one. When I caught the mistake after setup failed the first time, It insisted my home network did not exist. The app warned that it only works with 2.4 GHz networks, which my network is. It could not find the network even when I added the SSID and password manually. Yet the phone with the app was on the network. Then the app locked up when trying to name one of the plugs. Pressing ""continue"" just caused the phone to hang and come back to the ""name the device"" screen in an infinite loop.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
although direct access to all the functions for manual administration is available as well and works fine on all tested function,5.0 ,"I tested all functions of the extender -- officially called ""RE370K, v 1.0"" -- except controlling it over the TP Link cloud from outside the WiFi network. Everything works as described or as expected within 2 days of testing. - The set up was simple with a built-in wizard, although direct access to all the functions for manual administration is available as well and works fine on all tested functions, which included setting the new password, discovering and connecting to a WiFi network on both 2G and 5G bands, backup to a file, factory reset, restoring from the file. - Visually, no latency or jitter were observed when using extender during a 20 min YouTube video test that included alternating moving people and cartoon clips. - No visible degradation of upload or download speed was noticed as well (avg. of 90 MBit/s over several tests using speed test on Google/Chrome for Windows 7 laptop on a 100 MBit/s broadband network and ~50 MBit/s on iPad Air) - The local control was tested using Casa app installed on iPad Air. Power socket on/off tests and timer tests where all successful, except a glitch in the app, which added 1 hour to 1 min countdown test, but the extender worked correctly while the app showed incorrectly. - The extender does remember the last state of the power socket and returns to it correctly after being unplugged, but only after boot of its OS (takes about 1 min.) In other words, it would turn the power in the socket ON about 1 min after the power is restored to the extender if the socket was ON before the power went down. My main complaints are about usability of its external design: lights/buttons are so small and are placed very inconveniently, that you likely will not be able to see or press anything without removing the extender and plugging it in a specially accessible place. Also, the extender is too wide to work well on some wall or even corded power strips. Making it a bit slimmer, even if longer would have helped, in my opinion.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Just works. Flawless with Alexa. Reliable.,5.0 ,"I really love these things. I've got about 15 of them, the std HS 110 model, and the in-wall HS 200 switches around my house for various things, and they are used daily. With a few Amazon Echos around the house, we can control lighting inside and out with simple commands. Setting these up is incredibly simple using the Kasa App. The app will find their ad-hoc network after boot, program your desired wifi setting, reboots it and your off and ready. Inside the Kasa app you can program timers, names, scenes when you have multiple, and quick one-touch commands. I really haven't found any features lacking. The Kasa skill for Alexa is great, and allows creating command groups for control. It's a little complicated when you start creating groups using friendly names that sound alike, as you can command a group name or an individual switch name, but overall, once you get it set it's flawless. Furthermore, the reprogramming is super easy. Reset to factory, and reprogram is equally simple. Fortunately, I only had to do that when I rebuilt my wifi to handle this many devices (around 70 wifi devices now in my smart home). I haven't had to reprogram for any other reason (like losing settings), and if the wifi goes down, they can be reconnected automatically in a short time, or if it's prolonged, simply unplug to reboot and they'll reconnect quickly. NOTE: STD WiFi, like your Comcast or simple Best Buy WiFi router, cannot handle more than 15-20 wifi devices at once, so if your looking for a smart home with lots of WiFi devices, and still using tablets, phones and laptops, be sure your WiFi is up to the task. The simplicity of the devixe and control using the Kasa App over WiFi was what won me over Hue and WeMo, both of which are more complicated, and require appealing hardware, not to mention usually more expensive! I really cannot recommend enough.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Reasonably easy to set up, and they seem to work well.",5.0 ,"I like these. The number one thing I found helpful was the form factor. They are decently small, and if you want you can put two side by side in a standard size electrical outlet. They also seemed to have better WIFI connectivity than the WEMOs smart plugs I use in other parts of the house. (I had been using an older WEMO switch in a bedroom that didn't seem to get great WIFI, and it was so sporadic that I swapped it out with one of these just to see, and it worked better so we kept it in that room to stay.) They were also reasonably easy to set up, though I noticed that i had to turn the VPN OFF on my phone temporarily in order to connect to the switch and set it up for the first time. (When I had tried to set up the smart plug without turning off my phone's VPN I wasn't able to finish the set up process.) However, after the initial setup I was able to turn back on my VPN and I had no further connectivity issues. And, like the WEMO smart plugs that I also use this set allows you to set up rules, as well as to group switches together and turn multiple switches on or off at the same time with a single button. In this case I have both of them in a child's room and I like the ability to turn them both off at night if the lights were on when my child went to sleep. Overall I liked these and I suppose it is a toss up as to whether I buy this brand or the WEMO brand in the future. One thing I definitely know, though, I am not going to buy a third brand and have to deal with yet another app to control a different system... two is enough.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Great little plug!,5.0 ,"I bought these to try as the placement of lamps and switches in my apartment is rather awkward, where you have to walk way into the rooms to turn them on, and by then you've already tripped over yourself in the dark. These plugs are fantastic! They only take up one outlet and leave the other wide open if needed. Super easy to set up via the app and with Alexa and I have basic, 12 foot extension cords plugged into them which are working fine. On those nights when I'm coming home from work in the dark, it will be nice to just flip the lights on without having to worry about setting up timers. I'll definitely be buying more and while these are on the ""pricier"" side compared to some of the no name brands, if they keep working as smoothly as they appear to, they'll pay for themselves 100 times over.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Bring Wifi to every corner and turn on lamps with your mind... through Alexa,4.0 ,"TP-Link Smart Plug, Easy Setup, AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender/Repeater, works with Amazon Alexa, 2 in 1, remote control by Kasa app Not the fastest Wifi extender/repeater out there but adds a remote controlled outlet which can be used to remotely switch a lamp or other electrical device on and off from your smartphone, tablet or Alexa device. I planned to use the TP-Link AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender/Repeater to extend Wifi from my TP-Link Archer C9 Wifi router to a Blu-ray player in the lower level at the far end of the house. Unfortunately setup attempts using the TP-Link Kasa app on my android phone did not go smoothly at all so, after 4-5 unsuccessful attempts, I eventually switched to a laptop in order to use the built-in web interface on the extender/repeater for setup. This was quite easy and worked perfectly on the first try. My Blu-ray player easily connected to the new extender and had no problems playing streaming HD video from YouTube and Amazon. Next, I ran the Alexa app, installed the Kasa Smart Device skill and linked it to my Kasa account giving Alexa access to the smart outlet. My Echo Dot easily found the switched outlet on the extender but Alexa initially stumbled when asked to turn on the ""TPLINK light"". Changing the name of my smart outlet device to ""light"" fixed the problem and it has worked flawlessly ever since. All in all, the TP-Link Smart Plug/AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender works quite well but the Android version of TP-Link's Kasa app could stand some improvements.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
We're a TP-Link family!,5.0 ,"These plugs are larger than I expected. Wish they had side outlets, I had to get one of those power strips with side outlets so I could put it behind the couch. Had a problem with the initial set up. Got on the phone with customer service, who stayed on the phone with me for over an hour troubleshooting. We finally gave up while I called my internet provider (who was NO help). Before I packed them up to send back, I tried again. IT WORKED! Only thing I can think of is that my router needed to be rebooted, and I changed my password to be on the safe side. Long story short, customer service is awesome. These plugs are awesome.

Now she can check it anytime from anywhere and in the event she forgot to turn it off she can do it remotely. Pros. Easy to install and setup. Provides convenience and Pease of mind. Cons.

"Not the fastest extender, but the Smart Plug is a useful tool.",4.0 ,"As a WiFi extender in the AC750 class, it's probably as good as many for broadening your WiFi coverage. I have used many over the years and they pretty much do the same thing. This is not a powerline unit, so you can expect the same speed reductions as other extenders of this type. Example: my direct connect to my laptop and an AC1900 wireless router recorded 300 Mbs. from the same location--- this extender recorded 85 Mbs. Still quite usable for most applications. It also has a gigabit plug for devices that can take advantage of this feature. Of course, those numbers decline the further distance from the router I have. Bottom line, it does what it is supposed to do and that is to extend your WiFi range and add Smart Plug technology. Set up was very easy. I downloaded the Kasa for Android application. I did not register for any of the added features that are available, but will look into them later. After entering the same password used to log in to my router, I was connected. I plugged in a lamp to test the Smart Plug, identified it on the Kasa app and turned it on/off. I worked perfectly. This is not the best or the fastest WiFi extender, but the added usefulness of the Smart Plug makes it a nice dual purpose addition.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Very useful WiFi range extender,5.0 ,"The TP-Link AC1200 Wi-Fi Range Extender/Repeater works very well. However, it was very difficult to set-up. The application on my phone kept locking-up at odd times, like when naming the device or entering passwords. I was forced to close the application and start-over. Also, the instructions are confusing when directing the entry of passwords, for example it does not distinguish which password to enter, the TP-Link product's password or the existing WiFi network's password ? It took an hour to get it to work. I finally had to use the provided Ethernet cable and connect to my computer to get it to work. Then, when I tried to connect my separate TP-Link SmartPlug to this extender, that too took an hour due the application on my phone locking-up.

It's Been an Experience,3.0 ,"I am frustrated. I can work this through the Kasa app, but the only time it paired successfully with Alexa, she kept asking me which Lamp to turn on. I had only set one plug, and the app only showed one. I did a complete reset and now she finds a device but not the correct device. I don't have any other devices. Troubleshooting in neither app helps. I tried to post a question in Amazon, but something ""went wrong,"" according to the page. This is too buggy and may have been launched too soon.

Pretty cool way to add Alex and extend Wifi.,4.0 ,"Since my home has been taken over by Alexa, I figured the next step was to work on home automation to turn on/off lights and more. The TP-Link range extender was going to handle two things in my life: extend a dead spot for wifi in my house, and allow for an on/off switch for a lamp. Setup was ok - downloaded and created an account with Kasa, and then plugged this into the living room wall and plugged a lamp into the wall. Getting Kasa to talk to the Alexa app was pretty painless, and getting Alexa to turn the lamp on and off was quite cool. As for extending the wifi - it did extend it just a bit (although in my case, a powerline adapter might be better) using the unscientific method of looking at the signal bars on my iPhone and laptop. Overall I'm happy - it would be nice for Kasa to allow for Google/Facebook authentication vs me creating an account in which I'll forget the login to - but this is just a minor annoyance. This definitely made me want to invest in the smart plugs for simple on/off functions around the house, and the fact that I can logically group them into rooms is amazing. 4 stars","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
) and I was looking for something that could have an easy schedule set up to turn some lamps on just ...,4.0 ,"I bought these because my current apartment gets no light at all during the morning hours (you can hold your hand to your face and not see it at 9 am...) and I was looking for something that could have an easy schedule set up to turn some lamps on just before I need to be waking. These have worked well for that task. They were super simple to set up (took about 10 minutes) and the phone app (android) does a pretty decent job and it's nice to be able to control the lamps if I'm away. There is a delay of maybe 500ms between when I turn the light on in the app and when the lamp lights up, not bad. I don't quite get why you would need a hub to access some of its other features ( you don't need a hub to schedule power on and power off times based on day of the week and time of day) when it's controlled via the web and your network.

Thumbs up on these mini-plugs,5.0 ,"I have several of these in use and am very happy with them so far. Plusses - since they are mini, you can use two per normal duplex outlet.

With the Kasa remote application on the phone, I can have mini-plugs in different locations (in two homes in Texas and Maine) and operate them from anywhere via the internet. These don't require a hub of any kind and installation/setup is easy. They connect easily with Amazon Alexa. I haven't used the schedule function extensively, but it seems to be robust.

"If you're looking for a wifi controlled smart plug, this is the one!",5.0 ,"I have both Belkin and TP Link wifi switches and plugs in my home.

These plugs are easy to set up, respond quickly and don't randomly ""drop off"" like the Belkins do. Now, to be fair, Belkin has been getting better with each release, but my TPs never had the issues of dropping off, needing frequent updates, etc. Additionally, I put one of these OUTSIDE my house where the reception is not as good for wifi. It is in a weather shielded area operating a fan for us during the summer (California - so we do have a summer) in our storage shed. It has worked perfectly for a couple months despite the sub-optimal location. On top of all this, the TPs cost less. All that said, the TP app is not quite as complete as the Belkin, but it is quicker and easier to use for what it does. So, no deduction.

Works Fantastic-Easy Set Up,5.0 ,"These are super easy to set up. I bought a total of eight of them and now I can truly cut the power I'm paying for when I shut off my gear. I've got a fan and a few other things hooked up. I can voice control with Alexa, which works flawlessly, or I can turn on and off from my phone. You can set groups. You will have to make an account with TP-Link but the instructions are in there. You need the Kasa app on your phone. If there are other apps you can use I don't know but Kasa is working perfectly. I use my phone to turn everything off, 12 devices, at the same time. I expect my next electric bill will be significantly reduced but even if not these are worth 5 stars for the convenience. Definitely recommend.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Solid smart plug,5.0 ,"Overall, these work really slick. As a concept overall, smart plugs are great. And as far as smart plugs go, these ones are pretty good. They're a bit smaller (less wide) than the Belkin WeMo plugs, which I like, but I wish they'd start making these as right-angle plug adapters, because it seems like all smart plugs right now are these giant blocks that stick out from your outlet and make it impossible to plug things in behind furniture. Still, this does exactly what it says it does, and I haven't had any problems with them. They sync up with your phone via the Kasa app (which, unfortunately, is yet another app you have to have on your phone if you want to have a smart home), but also work with Google Home, which is great. (""Hey Google, turn on the fan!"") I like that the manual control button is on the side because I have one of these plugged in behind my couch, and in a tight space like that it's much easier to access from the side. For comparison, the Belkin WeMo has the button on the front, which I think is harder to find and press when you're reaching behind the couch or under the desk or any other place where you'd want to be able to control the plug remotely.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Allows you to wire a switch to be voice or smarphone activated,5.0 ,"This switch hardwires so you can use voice to control a light. It works from the TP-Link Kasa app. Once you wire it and set it up on your phone, you can set up a timer on a switch, dim lights (if they are the right kind) or voice activate a switch. This device can automate light switches, and it will integrate with Amazon's Alexa, meaning you can voice control with an Echo or Dot. You can choose iPhone or voice to control smart switches. Once you get used to using Alexa to do things, it is so much easier to issue a voice command when you walk in a room. For a while, I was using the Echo itself to make a night light--the blue ring would give off enough light to get me from bedroom to bathroom, but for coming upstairs in the dark evening, issuing a voice command to turn on the lights is great. It also could work on the ceiling fan; have you ever wanted to turn off your bedroom fan but not get out of bed? Wire this to your switch.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Handy Little Gadgets – Especially for Home Security When You're Away,5.0 ,"Works like a charm! We used these to control lights and radios throughout the house while we were on vacation. We thought we'd have to remember to turn devices on and off while we were gone, but these little Smart Plugs are programmable. We set some lights for specific times and others for ""random."" We tested them for two days before we left, and they did what they were supposed to do. We especially appreciate the ""random"" feature, because anyone watching the house would notice that lights and music come on and go off and different times throughout the day. Can't do that with a rotary timer! We're glad we bought these, and we recommend them to others.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Amazing devices and app with 1 tragic flaw,3.0 ,"I bought in total six of these. They were a great introduction to home automation, especially using the tplink Kasa app and Alexa skill on Amazon echo and dot. The problem was they were such a good intro to home automation that I replaced them all with GE in wall zwave smart receptacles, I also replaced all the fan switches and the majority of light switches in the house. Those required a controller and another app like Samsung Smartthings. So these are back in the box after being a great proof of concept because it's too complicated to use multiple apps even though they all seamlessly with with Alexa. When they become Smartthings compatible they will come back out. 5 stars because they worked so well and so easily. 1 star for not being compatible with the broadest ranging smart home controller averages to 3.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Unreliable,1.0 ,"Was working great, until it wasn't. Was really happy about how well these worked. They're connected to lights so that I can turn them on remotely. Mainly used to turn them on while we're out. And they had been working well for about two and a half weeks. Then one of the lights were no longer connected on the app. The message says that it may be off or out of range. Well, I walk over and see that it's on and connected (green wifi light). Restart the app, restart my phone. Nothing. Same message. Finally unplug and plug it back in. Wait for it reconnect. Still not working. After a few minutes, finally working again. Totally soured on this product. The wifi router is less than 30' away (a Asus RT-AC66U, not some super cheap router). Single shouldn't be an issue. Especially since the status on the plug itself says that it's connected. Simply unreliable. If this happened years down the line, that would be one thing, but after less than three weeks of use? I had planned on getting more of these, but now I'm considering whether it's worth the hassle to return them.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Problems with connection- finally solved on my own,3.0 ,"Received it today, have already spent an hour of my time and another hour with their tech support and cannot get either of the two i bought to connect. Forget the network, close the app, connect again, over and over and over for an hour. Can you get closer to the plug - I'm holding my phone an inch away, can you move it closer to the router, yep, still doesn't work. After an hour, well, I'll need to write this up and send you to a second level support team member. They will call you within 24 hours. Ugh! Update : they did get back to me by phone and then a few emails. They suggested a firmware update which still didn't work with my smart plugs. After asking them to call me instead of communicating by emails back and forth things improved and although my smart plugs still aren't working they are sending me replacements so we'll see if the new ones work. Update: received second set of smart plugs direct from TP-Link. I'm having the same connection problems. Now the tech is blaming it on my iPhone which has the KASA app. After 45 minutes of trying to understand her and waiting while she probably read the help manual, I got the same ending, ""we'll turn this in and someone will get back to you in 24 hours."" Sigh. Later in the evening I decided to try connecting with my iPad and lo and behold it hooked up quickly! I'm not sure why my iPhone SE with newest firmware wouldn't work but my iPad would, but the plugs now work.

Useless tech support and malware for your troubles,1.0 ,"I was really hoping this product would be an easy and simple solution to wifi dead spots in my home. Not only didn't it fix my dead spots the TP-Link FAQ page sent me to a page that installed Malware on my computer. Here's the story: I contacted the TP-Link tech support, who are dumber than a bag of hair. Seeing as they clearly didn't know what they are doing I started looking for help on the TP-Link site. I found instructions on how to log into my range extender and began following them. When I followed the link on the FAQ I got a message saying my Flash needed to be updated. Trusting that the TP-Link site wouldn't send me to a malware site I clicked permission to update Flash. And that's how TP-Link will likely infect you too.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Easier than expected ...,5.0 ,"Great little gadgets! Installation took me less than 10 minutes and that's including linking them up to my Amazon Echo. Build quality seems good, and the pins make it sit pretty solid in you power outlets. These plugs use the Kasa app for your iPhone or Android device - at least one of these seems needed to setup your devices. Personally I would prefer a completely Internet independent system, but with Amazon Echo integration, using a cloud service might be unavoidable. For those who do not plan on using Echo, and only want to remotely control their smart plugs when they are at home (their phone connected to their home WiFi); the Kasa cloud service would only be needed for initial setup, but is not required afterwards. Highly recommend these plugs!","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
This is for the Wifi Extender.,4.0 ,"Unlike some of the other reviews, I had zero issue getting everything set up. Maybe 10 min from start to finish, and that includes setting up the smart plug part of it as well. It does help if you have TP-Link products currently as all the set up goes through the App and is just setting like setting up a plug or light. The ONLY reason it is not a 5 star is the size of the plug area. It pretty much takes up the space of 2 plugs in the outlet. I ended up just using it in a power strip....and it still took up the space of 3 outlets on it too.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Is this so hard to figure out?

The Mini plug is a much better plug than the full Smart Plug. Easy to set up. Works well with Alexa.,4.0 ,"The biggest problem I had with the earlier TP-Link Smart Plug was that it was so poorly designed that it took up both plugs in a wall outlet. But, with this TP-Link Smart Plug Mini, TP-Link has fixed this problem and now has a very good wifi plug. Setup couldnt have been easier. I already had the Kasa app on my Android phone. I just plugged in the Smart Plug Mini, opened the app and told it to look for the new device. Even though I was upstairs and the plug was downstairs, the plug was found and connected. The app even asked me which wifi network (guest or the main network) I wanted to use for the plug. I gave the plug a name and that was it. Without doing anything else, I asked Alexa to turn the plug on. She found it no problem and turning it on and off through Alexa or the app is easy. The plug has a blue light at one end when it is on and it makes a satisfying click when it is turned on or off. The only complaint that I have about the TP-Link devices and more specifically the Kasa app is that it dosnt have an away mode. My Belkin Wemo app which controls my Wemo devices can be set to be in away mode between certain times. When in this state, the devices will turn on and off randomly between the hours I set. This is great when you are away and you dont want your devices turning on and off at the same time each day, indicating to everyone that they are on a timer. However, Kasa only has the timer feature. Overall, the TP-Link smart plug mini is the best plug from TP-Link so far. But with the Wemo plug at about the same price, the away mode for the app would sway me towards the Wemo plug even if the Wemo app is very buggy.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

We plugged 2 different lights in, named them differently, and grouped them as lights. It feels like the FUTURE haha. They have worked flawlessly so far.

Works flawlessly with TP-Link's app but to take it to the next level - sync it with Alexa,5.0 ,This is a 2-pack of TP-Link smart wi-fi plugs. The plugs work great in that the connection to your home network is solid as I've had a couple of lamps plugged into these sockets for the past several weeks and they work flawlessly (on & off) after being toggled 10-20 times per day. The setup process to get them to respond locally should take 5-10 minutes max. It all starts with TP-Link's 'Kasa' app which is extremely well designed with clean and beautiful presentation and intuitive control and operation. Having your plugs synced with the app is all good but to take it to the next level you'll want to get it hooked up to Amazon's Alexa system for voice control. I use Amazon's low-entry Echo Dot product with the HS100 plugs to great effect. Truth be told the setup process between the plugs and Alexa is slightly more complicated but if you read the instructions carefully (on the Kasa app) to understand the steps necessary on the Alexa app you should be operational in just over 10 minutes. The only downside with this product is that once you have your first plug or two connected and synced with Alexa you're gonna want to get even more plugs.

Love the convenience and simplicity of these mini smart plugs,4.0 ,"I love the convenience of these mini smart plugs, and really admire the simple genius of making them just the right size to plug into a single outlet while leaving the other outlet easily accessible (for a double outlet arrangement). That was something that frustrated me with previous smart plug's that I had obtained as those tended to block half of the original outlets while offering up one single smart plug socket. These work fairly well though are still a challenge for me (as have been all prior smart plugs that I had gotten) in training other household members on how to use voice commands to control things in the house. While it would seem so simple and natural, the older generation in the house seems to fall into the old dog category for this stuff while the youngsters pretty much snicker at them not being as quick to adapt, or worse, in the case of one of my younger loved ones, they derive amusement at my frustrations in those cases where I'm issuing voice commands and they aren't working as intended. There's also been the frustration (at times) of me being in the middle of giving a voice command only to have someone wanting to carry on a conversation that confuses the Echo devices and causes the need for a retry. Additionally, well, for me I've got a couple of noisy parrots (or large parakeets) that love to chime in with their own added noise distractions that also confuse the devices. Things are improving, and I appreciate it, but it just isn't all the way there yet for me and/or my family. It'll get there, I know, just have to be patient, but in the meantime as more great little gadgets such as these are made available, the situation will certainly keep getting brighter.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Truly Simple & Easy to Use with Echo,5.0 ,"These are truly trivially simple to setup and use with an Echo. You just install the TP-Link Kasa app, and follow trivially simple instructions to setup, and then it is up and running on your network. If you already setup a device earlier (I had a TP-Link light bulb), it just remembers your network too. I just plugged both into an easy outlet in my kitchen and configured them one at a time on my Android phone, then I could just plug them in later wherever. They function very easily with the Kasa app. But what I really want is voice control with my Echo, and wow they were easy to use. It is pretty easy to setup for the first time in the Alexa app (search for Kasa and add your account, but wait until your Kasa account email confirmation). But if you already setup another device, it automatically notices the new devices on the same Kasa account. I used these for 2 floor lamps in my bedroom. So I created a single group easily in the Alexa app to control both device with the same name, and Alexa just understands. Wow these were easy to setup and use. However, a drawback is their size. They will not fit behind furniture that already hugs the wall. But the easy fix for that is just use power strip liberators or wall hugging extension cables or power strips (but they need to be grounded 3-prong) to connect this wherever you want. In my case one of mine went literally underneath the back of a tall wood dresser in the little space underneath it. I used a wall hugging extension cord, plugged this into that, and the lamp into this, and all tucked under the dresser. It works flawlessly. Btw, I also have a TP-Link wif-fi light bulb too. Now that one was truly stellar because it simply replaces a 60W light bulb exactly where it was. That one truly felt futuristic, and can dim. But now I also have two 5-bulb floor lamps with CFLs, and two wifi plugs are way more cost efficient than 10 WIFI bulbs. Every once in a while Alexa doesn't understand me and I'm still in a dark room, or I have to wait to make sure Alexa heard me as I leave the room. I think the key is to give it an easy name that will be easy for you to say, and for Alexa to understand.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

I also have many Echos and Dots around as one way to control them. These work very well, and are a decent price, especially as a two-pack. I suspect the reason other manufacturers are not packaging their units together in packs is because they are more expensive, and seeing the cost for two might scare people away altogether. I docked them one star because they are yet another standalone item with their own app. The future of these kinds of devices is for them to fit into a higher-level infrastructure to control them and other devices from multiple brands throughout the home.

I am giving this one star because zero is not an option. After an hour attempting to connect this to my network I finally gave up and have thrown them in the dumpster.

Smart Plug that really WORKS,5.0 ,"Sadly I'm seldom grinning when I review a tech product. Mostly because of the frequency with which they are difficult to set up and have abysmal instructions. Wow, was I surprised with this product. I have that giddy smile that accompanies a successful product test. This works GREAT! It configured easily and worked as advertised. It is annoying that I can seldom report that but in this case I am happy to inform the world and TP-Link, JOB WELL DONE. I scanned the QRC code on the quick start guide, downloaded the software into my phone, set the plug up and tested it in less time that it will take you to read this review. What is even better is that the configuration holds even if you unplug the smart plug and plug it in elsewhere in range of your network. Frankly that flexibility makes the product far more valuable as there isn't a need for constant re-setting the software. Even better is that this product interfaces with the Amazon Echo. I am impatiently waiting for delivery of my Echo and I can't wait to try it with this smart plug. This is a product I can cheerfully recommend.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Nice for controlling an outlet,4.0 ,"Set up is pretty easy, the typical process of temporarily connecting to it's Wifi, and then entering your own wifi password. It was briefly inconsistent working remotely (i.e. if I am not home), but maybe that was a fluke. This does not work with Apple's HomeKit, but the ""Kasa"" app does work, and does not require registration. There is a quiet click when turning on/off. Nice product and package design. As shown in the pic, the plug goes into the front, and it also covers the whole outlet -- i.e. 2 outlets become 1 outlet.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Typically I only get IoT devices that are HomeKit compatible (this isn't). Most of the stuff I have is compatible with HomeKit and Amazon Alexa. But I recently got an Echo Dot, so i thought I'd give this a whirl. Setup is about the same as any IoT device. And once done it definitely worked. Could use the app or Alexa to control.

It took me under 10 minutes to set up both the plugs on Wi-Fi through the TP-Link Kasa App, enable the skills on Alexa and then start using them.

It works just as advertised. The range was extended on everything. I no longer have any problems with any of the the signals.

smart plugs will not work,3.0 ,"Just had one of these fail on me after 1 month of use. Definitely a hardware failure - after resetting, re-adding to the network, and trying different plug combinations and other TP-Link plugs, it's definitely a faulty plug. Otherwise, the other 5 I own have been reliable and the latency to turn on/off is low. Note that if you are using these to turn on/off appliances and the appliance does not normally power on automatically after a power failure (such as is the case with most modern TVs), smart plugs will not work.

It works,4.0 ,"The biggest issue with the TP-Link smart plug isn't the plug. It's that so many of the devices I would control with it are digital switched themselves and so the plug turning on/off doesn't make the device turn on. The coffee pot, for example, has to be turned on after it has power. Same with the lamps, though that's a bulb issue and I could swap it back to normal bulbs and recover it. So, the TP-link system works quite well.

Horrible design for use on surge protectors. It covers two plugs or the on/off switch.

TP-Link finally succeeds!,5.0 ,"Last year I had reviewed TP-Link smart switch, and I was aghast to realize I had to tell Alexa to tell Kasa to turn on a damn switch. Why couldn't it work like a WeMo swtch, where I tell Alexa, turn on the light, and the light would turn on. TP-Link representative wrote back to me, telling me they've heard similar complaints from other people as well, and that they were going to fix it. And so they want back to their whiteboards, and what do you know...I can now tell Alexa to turn on <whatever name> and it works like magic. Both of them, actually--comes in 2 pack.

Mini is ultimately useless compared to the traditional smart plug.,1.0 ,"This worked well for less than a month.

Actually 4.5 star rating--Works wonderfully but a bit bulky.,4.0 ,"Smart home devices are pretty cool when they work and a waste of money and time when they don't work. In my house, if something works only some of the time, it does not stay in use and it warrants a very poorly rated review score. This is not my first TP-Link item nor will it be my last. As a brand they tend to deliver a lot of value for the money and once set up, they just work so I don't have to worry about them. These plugs are great. They work 100% of the time with the app and almost all of the time with Alexia (the issues are on the Alexia side not TP-Link's. Nothing seems to work 100% of the time with Alexia). You can control these via Amazon Echo/Dot devices or FireTV Sticks/Boxes. In our house the switch that sees the most use is a light behind our couch. We used to have to get up and walk around to turn it on or off but now we can use our Amazon FireTV remote to quickly turn it on & off. I also do the same with a lamp at the top of our stairs--I ask the Echo in the kitchen to turn it on and ask the Echo in the bedroom to turn it off. What I like about these is there is no hub or other devices to purchase or setup. That makes the setup process a lot quicker and less stressful. So why a 4 star rating you ask? A minor thing really. The bulkiness of their design. I would love to install these all over but their design has me want to hide them--behind furniture, behind drapes, etc. I am sure in the future TP-Link will update these to be smaller (or installable in-wall to replace existing outlets) and they will have nothing to stop them from taking over the world. ;) I would actually give these a 4.5 star rating but Amazon's system does not allow that.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

I have several Wemo smart switch/plugs similar to this product,5.0 ,"I have several Wemo smart switch/plugs similar to this product, and being a Belkin product, I had high expectations because they're one of the big names in the networking game. My experience with them has been...unremarkable. I've run into issues setting them up, keeping them connected, and have had to reset a couple of them multiple times. TP-Link has built its way from a budget brand to one of the brands of low-cost networking equipment I trust most. Fortunately, these smart plugs matched my expectations of TP-Link products. So far I've had absolutely no issues with them and setting them up was a breeze. The setup process is similar to the Belkin switches, but a lot faster and more responsive. The Alexa integration is fantastic, I have a 1st gen Echo Dot and a regular Echo, and the TP-Link plugs work perfectly with them. One of them is hooked up to a fan I have in my bedroom, which provides much-needed white noise while I sleep, but unfortunately also makes my room really cold in the mornings. So, while still in bed, I can say ""Alexa, turn off the fan!"" and 1 second later the fan clicks off and I am free to get out of bed without facing a blizzard. So if you're trying to decide between Wemo switches and TP-Link, my vote would be to go with the TP-Link switches. I also have some TP-Link smart LED bulbs which have also worked with few issues, so I think they've gotten this series right!","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
So easy to use and quite inexpensive,5.0 ,"I can't say enough about how much I love these smart plugs! I already had the Kasa app installed due to owning a couple of TP Link's smart bulbs (which are also terrific). All I had to do was plug these things in and tell the App to pair with them. They were instantly detected and the App offered a selection of icons or photos of the devices plugged in. I didn't bother with that because I paired these with Alexa. Any time I attach a different device, I just rename the device and ask Alexa to run discovery again. They just work. Simple as that. I've plugged in hefty items like my air purifier and I've plugged in lamps. No matter what I plug in, Alexa and TP Link's smart plugs just work. I have only been using these for a couple of weeks and I just take them for granted now. If I'm burning eggs, I can just speak to my amazon Echo and the air purifier gets to work. The best thing about these is their price, which is much lower than the competition, for example Wemo. And even if price weren't an issue, I found TP Link's products more reliable than Wemo. Look, if you're looking for plugs you can control from a web browser or phone, these are great. If you're looking for plugs to pair with Alexa, you're not going to do any better. these are just great.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
"Add ""intelligence"" to old school devices.",5.0 ,"Updated review to 5 stars. Makes lighting Christmas trees and lights a breeze. Makes my wife happy, and that makes me happy. Original review These adapters can be your first smart devices or or added to a larger setup, and they neither require a hub nor are they limited to TP-Link's ecosystem (works great with Alexa and likely would with Google Home). They do what they do rather well, but there are a couple things that will significantly impact your experience. * These (like any other ""smart plug"" type device) only work for traditional devices that power on when plugged in. Lights, fans, etc... Many devices nowadays enter a standby state or require additional control to get them working. Basically if you can unplug it, plug it back in and it's doing what you want, this can work! * The usefulness will depend on how you set this up. They provide an app to allow for control/schedule and you can use voice commands with Alexa. Schedules using variable times (like sunset) work too! Our main fans don't play nice when plugged in, but our lights do. We were able to schedule them and use the built in functionality to schedule our Dyson fans. Voice commands allow for overrides on top of the schedule and it all works well. As an added bonus, my sound machine is now app enabled!","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

"Great product, setup easy and quick, recommended!",5.0 ,"I've had this for about 2 weeks now (bought it locally at Fry's) and it works great. Setup was easy, and we had it working in no time. We have one connected to a living room floor lamp, another for a nightstand lamp in the master bedroom. Its working well with Alexa as well. Only con I would say is that it can get hard to find an outlet to have this connected to, because when you have it on a wall outlet, it blocks the bottom outlet, and we can't use the other at the bottom (but this also depends on the shape of the plug at the bottom as well). All in all, great product and also a great price if you purchase the two pack (like I did). You won't be disappointed. My husband was not really into it at first since we rent a 3bedroom apartment, but now he sees the value, especially when connected to an Amazon Echo device (we have 4 - Amazon Echo and 2 echo dots).

Not a mature product,3.0 ,"Packaging and presentation are very nice, directions are well presented, and probably applicable in a perfect lab environment. I work in IT for a large corporation and that's never the case. First the plug is large, so if your plugs were installed upside down and the switched outlet is closer to the floor, you'll lose that top outlet. Adding the plug to my network went well. But once it was joined, and everything turned on, it wasn't able to reach the plug. Seems like it took about five minutes for it to be seen. I have one subnet reserved, on a different SSID for IoT devices, so that may have had something to do with it. Once seen, it's time to set it up. The app is not very intuitive. Smartthings has gotten better in this area, but not perfect either. There are a bunch of icons, labeled as scenes. I don't see how to create a schedule, starting at sunset, randomizing outlets until a given time to make the house look occupied.

Love these,5.0 ,"I bought a pair of these along with the Echo (not through Amazon). I found them to be fairly easy to set up. You do have to download an app to your phone or tablet, and verify your email address when you register through the app. After that it is a matter of plugging them in and walking through the steps on the app. Depending on your wireless connection, it may take a couple tries, but if you are in any way tech savy, it should take no more than about 10-15 min. Once it is set up you can turn them on an off just pressing an icon on the app, or telling the Echo to do it if you have one. You can even schedule the lights to turn on and off at specific times, or set a timer to turn them off (helpful if you have a bedroom lamp plugged into it and you want to use it almost as a sleep timer). I am very happy with the purchase and will probably get more. My only gripe about it, is it takes up a lot of room pm the outlet and makes it hard to plug anything else into the second plug in the outlet that the unit is not plugged into.

Working great.,5.0 ,"Setting up my TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi Plugs could not have been easier. I used them to plug in lamps in my living room. There is a 4 step process that connects the plug to your network and configures it. I particularly like the free Kasa app which walked me through each step and verified successful completion. Within 15 minutes the plugs were working with my smartphone. It only took a couple more minutes to connect them to Alexa and group them in my ""living room"" group. The app also allows me to set up scenes like Good Night that shuts off all the lights. The Away function allows me to set an on time and off time for each day of the week. I can even turn the device on for a set period of time. Now just a simple command: ""Alexa living room on"" turns on the lights and ""Alexa living room off"" turns them off. I can not wait to try the other TP-Link products like light bulbs and more.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
Resolved Connectivity Issues with other TP-Link Devices,4.0 ,"By extending wifi range to the rest of the house, this device improved connectivity with other TP-Link devices (smart light bulbs) that intermittently had connection issues.

Is good when it works,1.0 ,"Is good when it works! However, inexplicably goes to sleep every few hours (in other words becomes unresponsive) and hence cannot be controlled by the Kasa app or Alexa (echo) unless one unplugs and plugs it back in (basically re-power/reboot it). If it goes to sleep and you are on the road there is no way you can control the device hooked up to it (home lights in my case) - Very Disappointing and OVER-PRICED.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

"Multi Step, but easy set up",5.0 ,"I ordered these to use in an LED lighted cabinet. After opening the package and referencing the Quick Start Guide, you will see that you need to down load the TP-LINK app onto your smartphone. From there, it is actually easier to follow the instructions in the mobile app, rather than the ones on the QuickStart Guide. Once you plug in the adapter, it will find your network. You will then enable it with your network password, then use the app to name the plug for the specific device. You are even able to take a photo of the item (in my case the cabinet) that will serve as an icon for that device within the app. This would be handy if you had many items to control - say lamps in several rooms. The fact that it will work with my Amazon Echo was an added bonus. The Alexa set up instructions are on the TP Link web page, and are really painless as well. TIP: Keep you item/device Names short if you are using with Alexa. I used a two word name that I may go change. Eventually I will replace all my old manual plug timers with these.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

The features are simple and easy to use, and the timer function is cool and useful. You can turn on and off a plug from anywhere with internet access and it works pretty reliably so far.

Works but require some hassle,3.0 ,"Device is good but APP needs improvement on phone compatibility and to provide more useful information when installation running into problem. I purchased this Smart Power Plug to remotely control some appliances. The initial setup went smoothly without any problem. However when I moved this plug to a new location with different WiFi router, I was facing recurring problem and never get it to work again. The APP stuck in ""cannot find the device"" mode even I was able to get the plug to the configuration mode and connect my phone to the plug directly. After many hours' effort and without any useful information from the APP or searching online, I finally gave up. After so much frustration of setting it up, I still want to find out the root cause of the failure. My current phone is Samsung Note4 and I want to check if this problem is phone or OS dependent. So I installed Kasa on an older Android phone (Samsung Note3) with relatively clean environment. I'm happy that I was able to run through the installation without a hiccup. And, since I use same Kasa account on both phones, I was able to control the plug from my Note4 after successfully installing the plug on the old phone Note3. Now I can use the plug again after so much hassle.

Combined SmartPlug and WiFi extender,5.0 ,"I'm overall pleased with this product. It does require a bit of hassle to setup (via PC) but is worth it.

I am now able to get a file transfer speed of 8 MB/s between my downstairs PC (plugged directly into modem) and my upstairs PC (connected via this product). This is compared to the 2.5 MB/s at best that I was getting via WiFi. so that's a big improvement.

Well-Priced First Step Into Home Automation,4.0 ,"The TP-Link HS100 Smart Plug fits into a standard outlet and gives you control over your connected device. The HS100 is the simplest most cost effective way to experience home automation - it gives you basic on/off control. I use these outlets primarily for lamps and along with the Kasa app you can play around to test its capabilities. The HS100 Smart Plug is designed to work with the iOS or Android Kasa App (download from your app store) on your smartphone or tablet. After installing the bulb, the App guides you through the easy setup process. The application is feature rich and offers a variety of remote control options for lighting - from setting schedules (timed or to turn lights on/off, to creating scenes (movie mode, reading, etc.) to Away mode that provides security by turning lights on/off when you are not home. All these settings are managed from the App and can be controlled/set from anywhere in the world if you create an account. These features work locally without the need of an account. The application does work with Alexa and I am eagerly awaiting my Amazon Dot. You can also use these outlets with IFTTT (or IF) which extend capabilities, such as location based controls. Recommended. Pros: * Well-priced, easy experience into home automation * Plugs into a regular outlet * Easy setup - auto connects to Wi-Fi and Kasa walks you through * Works with powerful, feature rich Apps like Kasa and IFTTT * Customizable scenes * Away mode * Multiple outlets can be grouped together into single or multiple scenes * Commands through Alexa enables voice activated controls Cons: * Plug covers the entire outlet when installed into the lower outlet and partially covers lower outlet when plugged into the upper one.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

TP-Link Plug needs KASA app with limitations to work,3.0 ,"TP-Link Plug. Buyer beware. This TP Link product requires KASA app to initialize it. The KASA app is a mobile app and you MUST have a smart phone iPhone or Android. The app has another issue that has kept me from initializing the plug. The KASA app does not conform to the password specifications for WPA. The first release had up to 30 characters in the password. This latest release only allows 127 characters in the password. If you use a phrase for a password you will be ok. If you are like me and use a full 128 random hex code character string for the password, you will be unable to initialize the TP-Link smart plug. The password limitation has nothing to do with the plug itself, just the KASA app and its limitation. As mentioned, the other limitation of not owning a smart phone is a limitation for many too. TP-Link is supposedly working on a web based KASA app that will hopefully fix this awkward situation. But it has not been released yet. Hopefully if a TP-Link rep reads this they will hurry the release of the KASA web app and make sure it is fully compliant with WPA type passwords both raw and character formatted.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

A little too big and takes up both sockets on dual socket wall plates.The housing could have been made as sideways so that the plug doesn't block the other socket, even if we can't shrink the size of the plug! - alternatively, there can be multiple sockets out of this smart plug...to make up for lost socket. 2. Kasa iphone app: just one gripe with this: The away setting doesn't have a random time (on/off) setting. Aside from these, it works great! The iphone app works great. The installation was a breeze: installed the Kasa application on iphone. It recognized and asked me to connect to the tp-link wifi to do initial setup. I did that. It connected and the app screen let me add the smart plug as a device with a name (such as living room switch, receiver whatever), asked me to select my house wifi and password, and then the app switched the smart plug to my house wifi and voila, now I can turn on and off from my iphone app..","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Very disappointed with the TP-Link Smart Plug AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender/Repeater,1.0 ,"Very disappointed with the TP-Link Smart Plug AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender/Repeater, works with Amazon Alexa, 2 in 1 ( TP-Link Smart Plug, Easy Setup, AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender/Repeater, works with Amazon Alexa, 2 in 1, remote control by Kasa app ) . The one star is for the Easy Setup. Had no problems connecting to any of my 3 echos. Unfortunately, this ""2 ln 1"" unit only works as a Smart plug, an expensive one at that. I am very disappointed that the Range Extender/Repeater feature did not work as I had hoped. Although, I have a fairly good WiFi connection in entire house, the guest room is where sometimes there are some buffering issues (spinning circle) with Netflix. I hoped this TP-Link 2 in 1 Range Extender would help. When connected to this Range Extender, the WiFi connection is lost after 10 - 15 seconds. The same thing happens even if this Smart plug/ Range Extender is within 3 feet from router modem or anywhere else in the house. In addition, this unit has an Ethernet port, which I thought was a great added feature. However, when I connect any device to the Ethernet port of this Range Extender, the speed of this connection is 6.2 Mbps Down, 1.86 Mbps Up. Unbelievably useless!!!! I am returning it immediately. I have read many reviews of this item and barely anyone mentions the performance as a Range Extender. It appears either Amazon, or TP-Link set it up so the reviews refer to several different TP-Link branded items.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Worst Smart Home Device I've Ever Used and Very INTRUSIVE Account Linking,1.0 ,"I was looking for a smart plug that would work with Amazon Alexa. I regret this purchase not only because the device is a failure in the Smart Home market but because of the intrusive nature of the Kasa (TP-Link main company) in the way of privacy. They ask for too much for no reason even linking to your Amazon account if you let them. I have been stumbling around with temperamental WeMo switches from Belkin which were infuriating then on Prime Day this nice modern option with a great form factor appeared. It seemed like an ideal replacement, however I should have read the reviews. (p.s. - I tried setting up in both Android and iOS - the results were the same) First: For some reason you have to create an account with Kasa. Not just that but for some reason the Android app requires all sorts of privacy information they have no business having. But OK, how bad can it be? So I sign up for the account and set up the plug on the network. Second: Then I go into Alexa to discover and it can't find anything. Three: Ok, fine. Let's do smart skills because TP-Link has a smart skill option. I install that and it requires a link to my AMAZON account which feels like yet another violation since there is no reason Kasa should have any access to anything I do with my Echo. At this point I'm wishing I had just bought a few more WeMo plugs. But OK I'm too far down the rabbit hole now. Four: Nope. So I switch from my Android and go through the whole thing again on my iPad and had no better luck.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9
DON'T BUY MINI PLUGS,1.0 ,"I've had two mini plugs for a few weeks now. I bought these smart plugs so I could easily control some display cabinet lights in very hard-to-reach spots. I hoped I would only need to set these up once and then go through the App and my Google Home from then on. My hopes were dashed. My Google Home does not work with the mini plugs. I figured I'd still be gone just using the Kasa app, but problems arose with the plugs themselves. Every day to couple of days, the plugs disconnect themselves from WiFi and refuse to reconnect. I have to move multiple heavy cabinets and mainly reset the plugs when this happens. After reading a few reviews on TP-Link's own website, I discovered this is a very common problem. I don't recommend buying the mini plugs unless you do not mind factory resetting them and going through the setup again multiple times per week.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

"There Once Was a Fad called IoT, Which Some Say Weakens Privacy. So be careful, peeps",4.0 ,"Turning an IoT device like this into a commodity is nontrivial. You see this from reading the negative reviews. Apart from the CSR queue complaints -- which are seemingly numerous -- TP-Link is making an effort to respond appropriately. But you also understand why Google Nest wants to charge so much more. Consider this: - There are nuances in some home networks - Not everyone is using security best practices - There are old, unpatched or just unstable routers out there - Some people have little understanding of, or have forgotten the details of their network - Stuff [sic] happens. Cables, jacks, network ports go bad. (Just had that happen to a 2-month old HP desktop). - IoT providers must provision their cloud infrastructure to support devices - Smartphone software as well as cloud software must be patched to match OS updates and plug security holes - People can overload circuits. The plug is a commodity one, similar to the timer model I have purchased often Belkin Conserve Socket Energy-Saving Outlet with Timer,F7C009q though it isn't ""smart."" I wouldn't attach anything heavy duty to either. So those are all the reasons why a $50-75 part is really part of a much bigger ecosystem. Meaning a mfr must sell a lot of them, which explains the aggressive price point, considering the foregoing worry list. Add to my general list above a simple fact about wifi: it's not as reliable as wired. The places you want to put a ""smart"" plug are often not in the line of sight to get to a router. I'm in my basement, but my attic is four old floors away and reception up there required a separate access point. Some of the advice from other vendors with commodity products like this suggest crazy stuff like ""try it on a less congested network."" Really? ""Don't use it on a switch and connect directly to your router."" Really? Some of this ""advice"" -- not referring to TP Link here -- is oversimplified troubleshooting. Not helpful. MY RESULTS The device worked for me fine on Android (Nexus 6p), though I did have trouble forcing the HS100 to recognize the wireless network (I have several on premises). I wanted it to use.a different one from the first one recognized. When first registered, it showed both. The second time, it only showed the first one, so I unregistered (TP Link explains how to do this).and then selected the network I wanted. I don't have Alexa yet. I was a little reluctant to give up my router password to the setup process, so buyer beware on that one. When next you change the password, keep in mind that the Smart Plug setup could be affected. The cloud registration worked fine for me, though I expected a verification screen for the password. I don't like doing registration by smartphone because it's too easy to fat-finger a password. The HS100 should adopt 2-factor-authentication. You never know what consumers are attaching to their switches. Heart-lung machine? Crib monitors? But overall, the gadget is fun to use and will get you thinking creatively about how to conserve energy, or to make your home or office bend to your will. A good place to start is a smartphone tool that can browse and inventory both your wired and wireless network. You never know what -- or who - is connected these days.","TP-Link Smart Plug Mini (2-Pack), No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Occupies Only One Socket (HS105 KIT)",B06WD6Q8K9

Our outdoor speakers are connected to the inside living area T.V. so when the smart plug turns on we keep the volume high where it cuts off and on outside.","Wifi Smart Plug Wuudi Wireless Outlet No Hub Required Smart Timing Socket, Wireless Remote Control Your Devices Work with Alexa",B06X9PWDWH

The app is easy to use, and since I had added the skills to Alexa already, if was easy for Alexa to discover these almost immediately. Good looking plugs, and the price was right.

The setup detects my location properly, seems to be automatic but below is ""City"", choices in Non-English. Set the device to turn on at Sunset. No settings for which days. Then once all saved it doesn't work. I am left with just being able to press a button ""Perform"" for the scene. If I press it the device turns on. Sooooo whats the point of Sunrise/Sunset?

Don't bother - cheap junk that doesn't work.,1.0 ,"I work in tech and was initially determined to get this plug to function. I wasted a half hour of my life trying - until I finally gave up. The plug just wouldn't connect to the (poorly designed) iOS app. On top of that, the instructions leaflet was unclear, confusing and written in very poor English. Another piece of Chinese junk that just isn't worth the effort of trying it out. Do yourself a favor and stay away from it.","Wifi Smart Plug Wuudi Wireless Outlet No Hub Required Smart Timing Socket, Wireless Remote Control Your Devices Work with Alexa",B06X9PWDWH
"Weird, fragmented setup with bad English but the product works and is inexpensive",4.0 ,"I bought two of these smart plugs because they're significantly cheaper than the better known alternatives. Downsides: they're made by a Chinese company that no one's heard of, and ""Wuudi"" is something different than the app you need to use to connect it, called ""Jinvoo Smart Home,"" which wasn't publicly searchable in Google Play. The whole setup was pretty fragmented and weird and the English throughout the printed and digital materials was rough. That said, I figured it out and it works. The key is that you can't connect these to a SmartThings hub, which isn't the greatest, but you CAN connect right to the Echo. You basically have to name the item you want to control in the Jinvoo app, then have the Echo find it and add it to your smart home list, and then you can control it from there with your voice.","Wifi Smart Plug Wuudi Wireless Outlet No Hub Required Smart Timing Socket, Wireless Remote Control Your Devices Work with Alexa",B06X9PWDWH
I love this WiFi plug.,5.0 ,"We bought an Amazon Echo during Prime days so we are slowly purchasing smart bulbs and sockets to use with it. Maybe I'm just getting lazy but I love the ability to turn on my light on my end table by telling Alexa to do it (although I did have rotator cuff surgery on both shoulders recently and reaching for my lamp is not easy or pain free at the moment) My husband set it up and said it it worked better when he moved it closer to our wireless router while connecting it to my phone. Then once setup we moved it to my lamp in the family room and it works great. I renamed it Melissa's lamp in the phone app, (they list Jinvoo Smart app but I already had Tuya Smart app installed on my phone for another plug and some bulbs I have and it recognized this plug and worked just fine) Then go to your Echo and search for ""devices"" under the ""smart home"" section, it will find the plug and you are good to go. Now you can use your phone app or Alexa to control the plug (or even manually with the button on the front) I love it!","Wifi Smart Plug Wuudi Wireless Outlet No Hub Required Smart Timing Socket, Wireless Remote Control Your Devices Work with Alexa",B06X9PWDWH

Love these smart plugs, they are a cheap and easy way to transition your home into a smart home! It’s easy to set up and use, although I have not paired just her to my Dot as I'm still learning. The App is also easy to download and use. Its pretty neat what you can actually control from these plugs remotely. Its convenient to be able to turn on/off light or start laundry from a App on your phone. I have a broken leg currently so this has been nice to have as I'm not 100% mobile.

The minds of the really big stones down since I have the plug. I set a timer for my living room light, the light would go on automatically when I am away from home, this give thief a false impression that someone at home. Moreover, my light switch is set on high, it is a little difficult for me to reach it, then the stuff help me solve the trouble, because the light will turn on/off as long as I say “Alexa, turn on/off the living room light”. It is the best item I have bought on the Internet and very fit for those who seek for convenience in daily life, I want to buy another one for my bedroom.

Works great with Alexa,5.0 ,"A friend bought us an Amazon Echo - and as I began to play around with it, I decided to try out these wireless outlets that are designed to work with Alexa. We have a lamp in the living room that uses an old fashioned timer with a wired switch which was starting to fall apart, so I was hoping for this to be an improvement. Set up is fairly straightforward if you follow the instructions, though a bit difficult to follow since the manual had the smallest print - even hard to read with my reading glasses on. Download the app onto your phone, and then you can program the outlet. I had an issue where the outlet would not connect to my router or an extender that i normally use, but it connected to my Apple Airport access point without issue. Still could not figure out why it would only work with the Airport - but glad I had that option. After connection via wifi - it works great. You can use Alexa and speak commands to turn on and off, as well as the button on the outlet itself. You can also use the app to turn the outlet on/off, as well as to name the outlets as you desire, and even set the timer. We have ours set to turn the lights on and off automatically each day. So far, it has lived up to expectations.","Wifi Smart Plug Wuudi Wireless Outlet No Hub Required Smart Timing Socket, Wireless Remote Control Your Devices Work with Alexa",B06X9PWDWH
Easy to use,5.0 ,"Super easy to use and wonderful for things like lights in the house! I put this on a stand lamp in my living room and if I'm coming home late after shopping or something I just hate coming into a dark house! Plus it really alerts people that you're not home if it's all dark. Problem solved! I put this on a lamp in our living room and can just turn it on when I leave work or the store from my phone. No more dark house! I could see putting this on a fan too, we're in Hawaii and the house gets hot in the afternoon. It has an app to install on your phone which is free and super easy to set up, great if you don't want to come home to a dark or hot house.","Wifi Smart Plug Wuudi Wireless Outlet No Hub Required Smart Timing Socket, Wireless Remote Control Your Devices Work with Alexa",B06X9PWDWH

Literally, you plug it in the wall, plug in whatever you want to control via phone app and connect the plug to your wifi, with the click of a button it is turning on the lights in my room. I would highly recommend this for anyone that not only wants to move their home in the high-tech era, but for grandmas and grandpas that need light heading into a dark home. Another great thing about this is that you can set a timer for it.

When I first received it I really didn't know how it worked, because I know next to nothing about tech. However, all you have to do is to download the app (there is a QR code on the box for you to scan as a shortcut to download the app, but it's not required), and follow instructions on the app. However, the password for some reason is shown unencrypted which looked kinda scary, but I was able to connect my device within 5-10 minutes!

Reliable but has a few bugs that could be annoying at times,3.0 ,Works great with a few bugs which could be annoying if I used it for a major device in the house . I reported the issues I’ve been facing in the app that controls the device and it’s been more than 2 months and nothing has been fixed. Cheap price for this device however if you’re not okay with your lamps in your house blinking on and off simultaneously 3-4 times a day like me then I suggest you do not buy this. The only reason I’m giving it a 3 star is because I waited 2 months and I haven’t heard anything from the developer.

Works great with echo dot!,4.0 ,"If you are having trouble getting the smart plug outlet to work with echo dot, read below. The first thing you need to do is have your phone using the 2.4Ghz wifi signal from your router. For some reason the device will not work on 5 Ghz. Then download Tuya Smart app. After downloading Tuya Smart app, open it and register. You will have to put your mobile phone number and a password. Leave the dashes out of the phone number and don’t put your email address in. After that Tuya Smart will text you a five digit code to put in. You will have to go check you text, get the five digit code and put the code in less than 60 seconds or it will make you have to reregister. Next is Open up Alexa app. Click on SKILLS and then download the Tuya Smart Skill. Once you have done all these steps, now you can look at the directions the device came with and follows those directions.","Cevitor Smart Socket Plugs Outlet, Work with Alexa for voice control and APP Connect, No Hub Required, With 1 USB Port ( C2001P)",B06XFG586Z
Excellent for the Price.,5.0 ,"The Fashion plug works perfect and as described! Easy to set up and get going with my Echo Dot. Install the Tuya Smart app on my phone, and pair. Then enable the Tuya Smart skill for Alexa, and you are good to go. I love that all the chinese stuff I have gotten so far (bulbs and outlets) all work with the same app. I had previously purchased a Chinese Alexa enabled outlet from another brand (Aquiv) and was surprised to find that not only is this similar, it is literally the exact same plug! I purchased this for 13.99, which is the cheapest I can find on Amazon, so I wouldn't worry about brand too much as long as the price is right. If anyone wants to see what it looks like inside there are photos attached. You have to pry/pop out the little two little covers on the back, take out the two screws, then slide something down the crack to pop it open. 2 more screws inside secure the board.","Cevitor Smart Socket Plugs Outlet, Work with Alexa for voice control and APP Connect, No Hub Required, With 1 USB Port ( C2001P)",B06XFG586Z
Works Well With Alexa,5.0 ,"This is my first device I have purchased in an attempt to make my house smarter than I am - so far so good. I only installed the plug yesterday so can't speak to durability but here are a couple of points. I bought it to control my bedside lamp which has a difficult type of switch for arthritic hands and is very small and difficult to find in the dark.. The instructions are a little muddled regarding linking to my Echo Dot and that was aggravated by the Echo Dot instructions which never made it totally clear whether it was referring in various places to the plug's app or the Alexa app. Also, why can't manufacturers use larger type for their instructions? Had to get in a bright light and, even though my vision is pretty good, contemplated getting out a magnifying glass. Those complaints aside, it was easy to set up and functioned on the first try. Have used it several times and it was especially neat to have for one of those 2 a.m. trips when the path to the loo is usually littered with a couple of dogs. Another reviewer said it was hoggish when it came to the wall outlet. I plugged it into the bottom one and had plenty of room to plug a power strip, one with a bulky three-prong plug, into the top outlet. One suggestion - pick a name for the outlet - i.e. bedroom lamp - before you start installation. I let the software name it and had a bit of difficulty changing the default. All-in-all I am pleased and thinking I may get another for the bedroom television.","Cevitor Smart Socket Plugs Outlet, Work with Alexa for voice control and APP Connect, No Hub Required, With 1 USB Port ( C2001P)",B06XFG586Z

Good But With Pros and Cons,4.0 ,"First one of two had a very random start to the flashing red light necessary for set up. It took several minutes and many tries to get it into set up mode and get it to stay there. The second unit did not have that problem. Once the set up mode was activated, the rest of the set up was quick and easy. Both units now seem to be doing their job. The biggest negative is the rounded top that protrudes into the area of the second plug on a normal wall socket. It makes an adapter almost mandatory if you want to use the second plug. Since the rounded top is totally unnecessary for the proper function, it was apparently someone's ill-conceived idea of fashionable design. The USB socket is a nice add-on and does provide a charge to the iPhone.","Cevitor Smart Socket Plugs Outlet, Work with Alexa for voice control and APP Connect, No Hub Required, With 1 USB Port ( C2001P)",B06XFG586Z

2.4 GHz WiFi only! + Android solution,4.0 ,"Sorry if this is a little technical, but I hope it saves you time, frustration and/or the need to return the unit. This is 2.4 GHz WiFi device only, i.e., the device does not ""speak"" 5 GHz. Also, note that during setup, your PHONE MUST also be on the same 2.4 GHz network. Otherwise, setup will fail. So: If you have an older, ""pure"" 2.4 GHz only network - no problem! If you have a ""pure"" 5 GHz only network - DO NOT BUY this product, it will NOT work. If you have a dual 2.4/5 GHz network (most modern networks), then read on: -- if your network is set up as two separate SSIDs, one for 2.4 GHz and one for 5 GHz (typically the latter's SSID will end with ""5"" or ""5G""), just switch your phone to the 2.4 GHz SSID and proceed to set up the device on the 2.4 GHz SSID according to the instructions. -- if your network has only a SINGLE SSID (i.e., same SSID for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels), then, for the setup phase, you'll need to force your PHONE to a 2.4 GHz channel*. On old Android versions, go to Settings > WiFi > Advanced > Wi-Fi frequency band. Unfortunately, newer Android versions do not allow you to do that. The solution: download the ""WiFi Analyzer"" android app, where you force-connect to one of the 2.4 GHz channels of your network (denoted as 24xy MHz, where x and y are any digits). Again, this is only for the setup phase (of course I wouldn't recommend leaving your phone on 2.4 GHz only mode...). I hope this helps. * In theory you can also temporarily disable the 5GHz channels on your router, but that is more complicated, more likely to stop other devices from working, and in some cases (e.g., Eero routers) simply not supported by the router.","Kisslink Wi-Fi Smart Plug Mini, Compact Design, Works With Amazon Echo, No Hub Required, Remote Control & Scheduling On App, UL Certificated",B06XKB6P72
Stays connected to WiFi reliably and responds quickly to commands,5.0 ,"I have a TP Link HS-110 for over a year now, and the performance has been solid, and I'm extremely happy with it. I also have a smaller HS-105 and it too has been a solid performer. So far, this little guy is every bit as reliable as the TP Link. While this and the HS-105 are quite similar in size, they are very obviously not clones of each other. There seem to be multiple other units that are cosmetically identical to this Kisslink, and they're even available on Amazon (example: Voion, Swiftrans, Laneco). I don't know how they perform, but this one has been a solid performer. 1. It was easy to set up (just make sure you download Kisslink Home app and not Kisslink app like I did - that was for their router) 2. It stays connected to WiFi 3. It responds very quickly to on / off commands 4. It has countdown timers (e.g. turn off in 10 minutes) as well as schedules (e.g. turn on every Monday and Wednesday at 8 a.m.) 5. It can be controlled from local network, as well as from a remote network. There's also a switch to turn it on and off on the device itself. The Android app looks quite clean and is fairly intuitive to use. You will need to create an account - same as TP Link's smart switches. The app notifications don't seem useful and could not be dismissed, so I turned them off completely. The TP Link HS-105 occasionally sells for the same price as this. The two are very similar in size - I'll include a photo of the both of them next to each other. You'd probably want to stick to one brand or the other so that you don't have to deal with two apps. I'll update this if I encounter any issues with the smart plug, but as of right now, it is a solid performer for a good price.","Kisslink Wi-Fi Smart Plug Mini, Compact Design, Works With Amazon Echo, No Hub Required, Remote Control & Scheduling On App, UL Certificated",B06XKB6P72
"Works with Alexa perfectly, but the tradeoff is giving personal info to a Chinese company.",2.0 ,"I don't like that the software asks me a lot of info. Connecting to Alexa works very well, but you have to reveal too much information to a Chinese company named Tuya Smart. My McAfee anti virus warns about this company when I go to their main page. Contains malware and other suspicious activity. My plan is to crack open the smart plug and reprogram the ESP-8266 chip inside, but I am a techie and most people won't know how to do that. They sealed the unit very well probably with ABS glue, and I have not been able to get it apart... YET !

I wasn't sure if it would actually be useful or not, but now I've realized I need at least two more of these for a couple of other lights in the house, because they are harder to reach to turn on and off. I love that I can turn it on and off with the app when I'm away from home also. We put this on the light we usually leave on for the cats at night when we are out, and so if I am out during the day and don't get home early enough, I can turn the light on for the kitties--and also for me, so I'm not coming home to a dark house.","Kisslink Wi-Fi Smart Plug Mini, Compact Design, Works With Amazon Echo, No Hub Required, Remote Control & Scheduling On App, UL Certificated",B06XKB6P72

Great Price on Wi-Fi/Alexa Controlled Outlet,4.0 ,"As of now, this is the least expensive Wi-Fi connected electric outlet. Once you plug the outlet, it can be easily connected to WiFi and each outlet controlled separately with the app. Unlike Philips Hue, no hub is needed. This outlet is useful for devices/equipment where you often have to turn on and off when away from home; and they have mechanical on/off switch because the app can only turn off devices with electronic on/off switch - not turn them on. But Kisslink has limited range of products, unlike TP-Link. You do not want to have a separate app to control each device. So if you just need one outlet, it is relatively inexpensive but if you have multiple Wi-Fi devices that you want to control, the I would go for TP-Link.","Kisslink Wi-Fi Smart Plug Mini, Compact Design, Works With Amazon Echo, No Hub Required, Remote Control & Scheduling On App, UL Certificated",B06XKB6P72

When it's 11 at night and I'm already in bed and I realize that once again they've left that light on I don't want to get out of bed and go to the living room to turn it off. This plug was the cost-effective simple solution. Just follow the instructions and everything works as it should. Now I can turn the light off using the Echo Dot in the master suite and don't have to get out of bed. Well worth the price point and one of the few products I've tried that connected to my Alexa account without a problem.,"Kisslink Wi-Fi Smart Plug Mini, Compact Design, Works With Amazon Echo, No Hub Required, Remote Control & Scheduling On App, UL Certificated",B06XKB6P72
Wastes more time than it saves.,2.0 ,"After all the effort of downloading the app, following all the instructions to set it up and connect it to my Echo, I thought it would be smooth sailing. It wasn't. The plug keeps disconnecting from the internet. Everything else in my home is still connected, but this just keeps going offline. Then I have to crawl behind the couch to press and hold the button so that I can reset it with my app on my phone and re-enter my wifi code... it's a bigger pain that just turning the switch on the lamp on and off the old fashioned way.","Kisslink Wi-Fi Smart Plug Mini, Compact Design, Works With Amazon Echo, No Hub Required, Remote Control & Scheduling On App, UL Certificated",B06XKB6P72

2 accessories in 1! First: Dimmable Nightlight! Second: WiFi Outlet (perfect for a lamp)!,5.0 ,"This is a really neat WiFi Outlet! Koogeek products all can use the Home app which comes on the iPhone (as well as their own Koogeek Home app) but I prefer to use the Apple Home app itself. I have a few Koogeek products and when I purchased the first one, I was having issues with their app, and the Home app on my phone already worked the best. Set up each accessory as a little click button in the app itself. You can also turn it on/off by asking Siri. It confused me at first when it added two accessories to my dash when I had a single outlet, but it makes sense. Maybe you just want the nightlight on, which is an LED circle light around the plug port. Maybe you just want whatever is plugged in to it to be turned on. (You can only use simple button on/off devices with this outlet.) Syncing with your app, or, adding an accessory, is very easy to do. You will be putting this outlet online, so it is accessible from anywhere in the world, if you have a home hub -(iPad powered on with minimum requirements that is always on your WiFi, or the latest Apple TV.) When you set this Koogeek Wifi outlet up, have the item set to the on position when you plug it in, and when the outlet is off, your plugged-in device receives no power. Therefore, your lamp, or whatever is plugged in, is really off until power is connected to it again, and that is when you push the button to turn it on, automate it to turn it on, or ask Siri to turn it on. It's that simple. Note: if at first it does not work, do a system reset by holding down the button for 10 seconds and try adding the accessory again. For some reason this took me about 3 tries to get it to all work (both accessories within this outlet), but I got it all to work. Typically it takes a minute to do, and the instructions are well-written, and very easy to follow. Keep your instruction guide as it has the number you need to register the device to the app. You scan it in. There is also a sticker on the outlet with the code printed as well. You get to name your devices and set a location in your house. I set my lights on Koogeek apps to come on when I arrive home after sunset. How cool is that? You can also invite anyone you want to have access to the same thing you do. Love these products and how they can work with each other as accessories all on the home app. 5 stars! :) Great little product. :) 2 accessories in 1! 1) a dimmable nightlight and 2) a WiFi Outlet!","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Five Stars,5.0 ,"super cute smart plug. This is my second product from Koogeek. I love their products. It's very easy to set up just like the first product I got. I was supersized this is not only a wifi outlet but it also has a small light. The small ring light is controlled by the app as well and it's perfect to be used as night light over night. The outlet works very well and you can set different timers to control it. This makes my life much easier. No matter it's desk lamp, dehumidifier, or slow cooker that I plug into this plug, they all work great. Love Koogeek and I will definitely buy more products from them to make my house even smarter.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Works great with Amazon Alexa!,5.0 ,"Upon unboxing, I downloaded the Kogeek App for IOS. (Apple, for the uninitiated). Here are the steps I took: Before opening the App, I made sure my Apple Home App was functioning and connected to my ICloud Account. I opened the Kogeek App and paired the device with the App. I opened my Alexa page on my computer, and went to the Smart Home Settings. I clicked on Devices. The Kogeek was listed among my other Devices. I clicked on Skills, and downloaded the Kogeek Home Skill. I clicked on Smart Home again, and added the Kogeek plug to the ""Lights"" Group I had previously created. Now when I turn my Lights On and Off, the Kogeek plug automatically turns On and Off as well. Love it! Tip: If you're new to using Alexa to control devices, and you encounter problems, I'd recommend checking the Alexa settings, and also watching a few online videos to familiarize yourself with the functionality of Alexa. I have encountered problems with some of the plugs on the market, in terms of being unable to pair with Alexa so I can use my voice to control. I have not encountered those problems with this plug, as the Video shows. If you have any questions or concerns, please leave a comment. If anything changes, I’ll update this review accordingly.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
High quality Wi-FI outlet that works with HomeKit !!,4.0 ,"This is a great HomeKit outlet. If you have Apple systems, this outlet and HomeKit are great. It is easy to program the outlet – just open HomeKit and in the setup you take picture of setup key and the setup went flawlessly. Then you are all set to control the outlet with the HomeKit app or Siri. Siri is awesome – just say ""Siri turn on Family Room"" - and the switch quickly responds. The quality and fit and finish of the unit is great – it has a good ""feel"" of quality and the body is precision molded plastic. When the switch acts, it is a very positive / precision sounding action. There's also a nightlight white ring around the outlet – that is controlled separately from the outlet – very handy to see.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Easy to use,5.0 ,"The koogeek smart plug is an easy to use smart plug which can be controlled using the kogeek app. It is a plain simple plug which can convert any device into a smart device and giving you the capability of switching the device on / off remotely using the kogeek App. Along with the app, the kogeek device also works with siri (apple homekit) as well as amazon alexa. This support can be added by enabling the kogeek skill in the alexa store. Once enabled you can use the switch to turn on or off using your voice commands. This makes any device voice controllable. The device is very easy to use and just needs the kogeek app. You need to register for the app once and you are set. The app is also very well designed with simple UX.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

I like that I can set up a schedule with the outlet, and that I can now turn my lights and devices on and off just by telling Alexa. This plug is a great size and simple to use. When I read reviews, some said they had problem with the wifi connectivity dropping, but I haven't experienced any issues yet. I fiddled with the Koogeek app, but if you use Alexa, you don't really need to worry about it. Alexa handles everything.

Fast setup and works perfectly – with a bonus night light!,5.0 ,"Usually I expect private label electronics to be complicated and hard to understand/use, but this smart plug is exactly the opposite! It took less than a minute to set it up with the Home app on my iPhone, and most of that was trying to angle my phone to capture the pairing code on the bottom of the plug. It shows up in the Home app as two devices, a light and an outlet, so you can activate the ring around the outlet as a nightlight and control whatever is plugged into it separately. I've got the lamp in my fish tank plugged into this outlet, and I'm looking forward to figuring out how to set up automation with Homekit so I never have to think about it again!","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Smart Plug equals safety and easy living!,5.0 ,"All I do is try to convince people to outfit their homes with these Smart Plugs. Sometimes my fiance gets home from work before I do and when its dark she feels so relieved and safe to have the option to light up the home before she gets in. We also love the option of shutting off the lights when we go to bed or when we wake up in the morning. If you're creative, like me, there are fun options such as plugging in and air-conditioner and using the smart plug to turn it during hot nights or using it to make coffee. Between the light bulbs and these smart plugs, I'm all in on these Koogeek products.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

If you have issues connecting - check this router setting,4.0 ,"I initially had difficultly getting this device to connect to my Wifi network. The customer service was very responsive, but they were not sure what the problem was. I finally determined that having Access Point Isolation Mode (AP Isolation) enabled on the router was blocking the connections. By disabling this setting I was able to connect instantly with no difficulty whatsoever. So if you are having issues, be sure to check this setting on your router. After the device was connected I had no issue at all connecting it to Alexa and the commands via Alexa worked perfectly for both the outlet and the nightlight setting. The response time is good. The nightlight is a very nice level of brightness, bright enough to light the immediate area around it while not interfering with sleep. I would give them 5 stars, but the App for Android devices at least, is lacking in any programmable settings so far. I have spoken to the customer service team and they do expect to add scheduling and timer features eventually, so I will hopefully be able to upgrade my review to 5 stars at that time.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

Unplugging them and plugging them back in allows them to work again but only for a few minutes. The P1 outlets work just fine but not these. Essentially they are just frustrating junk in my opinion. I wish I could give them 0 stars. They just aren't ready for prime time. Too bad they don't have a firmware upgrade that would make them worth keeping. Horrible horrible customer support.

Fatally flawed - does not work with Apple TimeCapsule latest generation 2.4GHz network,1.0 ,"I've owned the original 'P1' KooGeek plug with no problems. However, I upgraded to this new 'P2' model and it wouldn't pair through HomeKit. My network is 2.4GHz and run by an Apple Airport TimeCapsule 802.11ac base station broadcasting in 2.4GHz and 5GHz. The device registration process in HomeKit stalls, and the P2 plug never joins the network. I emailed Koogeek, but after 3 days there was no response. I returned the first plug to Amazon and got a second one; same problem as before. The firmware in these must be buggy. My WiFi network name is simple, and so is my password (no spaces or special characters). I don't think the fit and finish on the software/firmware is polished/refined. Koogeek's own app intro screen boldly features a typo (using the word ""Rome"" instead of ""Roam"") which, coupled with its rough usability, does not inspire confidence in their quality control, as least as far as software is concerned. The app is somewhat amateurish. I'm afraid I have to return this second plug as well, as it just won't join the network. This is one of a dozen HomeKit devices I've owned, and the only one that's shown any problems being registered with HomeKit.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Unreliable,1.0 ,"Had these for about a month and at first they were pretty stable, but lately they’ve been getting the “no response” message from HomeKit and the Koogeek app. The only way to reset them is to unplug/plug them back to reconnect. Other HomeKit devices do not have this problem. I’ve also tried to reset them completely by holding the top button for 10 seconds but it doesn’t seem to extend the time before they become unresponsive again. As a workaround, I have connected them to some RF controlled plugs which allow me to power cycle them remotely, however that really degrades the value proposition of these plugs if I have to keep doing this. Koogeek should fix the firmware so the plugs reboot themselves if they lose connection or at least restart the WiFi adapter. I’m hoping this is fixed in the next update. Until then I cannot recommned these to anyone. UPDATE: May have found a fix for my setup. Since writing this review I have gone over two days without power cycling these plugs. Still may be too early to confirm but before the fix I would have to power cycle at least 2 times a day. First I increased the DHCP lease time to 7 days and then set the router to assign a static IP for each Koogeek MAC address. My guess is the latter is what solved the issue. Perhaps when the devices lease time expired, it got a new address from the router but HomeKit didn’t pick it up thus causing a break in connection. Of course, YMMV but worth a try. UPDATE 2: Looks like I spoke too soon. Just had to reset them tonight. Still better than before, but not great. Koogeek please fix them!","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Plain and simple,5.0 ,"I've tried quite a few smart plug outlets; some work and some don't. This one works! The app is easy and intuitive and walks you through the setup with clearly guided steps. It took a few minutes for the plug to connect, but once it did I plugged another extension outlet into it (is that cheating?) and two more plugs into that. I've hooked it up to decorative lights in my room, and now i can turn them on and off with a press of a button from the app! I love that it's that easy. The plug is kind of bulky; I'm unable to use the unused portion of my wall outlet because this plug blocks it. The light on the plug is not invasive or very bright, and is only on when the plug itself is on. If my phone dies or the app is inaccessible, there's a button on top of the outlet I can press to turn it on or off.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Great smart plug,5.0 ,"Did you ever ask yourself the question: Did I unplug this device? Well, for me this smart plug is the solution. I can now quickly check the app to see if I forgot to unplug the water heater. After I am so happy with this device I will get two more in winter time for the space heaters. The installation and setup itself was simple: - Plug the device into an outlet - install the app - create an account with Koogeek - follow the steps in the app - control the outlet from your app My only problem with the setup process was the account creation. For some reasons the error messages where not obvious and I had already an Koogeek account I used with another app. I had to reset my password but the email was ending up in my spam filter. The solution was easy after I figured out why I didn't get an email. This outlet comes with a night light. You can actually modify the brightness which is awesome. I could have saved my existing night light for the kids room which is actually a little bit brighter as I want it to be. What I found confusing in the app: You have two controls: one for the night light and one for the outlet. After I renamed them everything was obvious but I was wondering why I ended up with two devices in the app. It's also a little bit more confusing that you have to click longer on it to see the options. As result I initially turned off the power the first times I played around with it which is just a quick click. What I am missing so far is the option for a time based power on/off as well as for the night light. Else it would be perfect. The app can also show you the current power usage. I plugged the Koogeek into a smart a plug and it's mostly accurate. It was off by around 0.4 Watt (after removing the power consumption of the Koogeek plug). That makes a difference of less as $1 a year if you run a 0.4 Watt device 24/7 (and pay a high 20cents/kWh) The Koogeek itself consumes 0.9Watt without the night light. With the night light on 100% brightness it was around 1.2 or 1.3Watt. Therefore having it plugged in without the night light the entire year costs you less as $1.50 per year if you pay a high 20cents per kWh. I didn't hook it up to Amazon Alexa yet since the app is totally sufficient for me. This outlet gives me piece in mind and doesn't cost me much electricity. It actually will save me a lot if I notice in winter that I forgot to unplug the space heater.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

Like an stab in the back...,1.0 ,"Don't get me wrong, I love Koogeek, I own several of their products, I am so thankful that they created affordable products for a smart home. I had so many high hopes on this P2 Outlet, but it fails, and sad. I feel betrayed. I have tried many solutions: Taking it closer to the router, checking there are available connections, Of course 2.4g wifi Resetting the Home app, Koogeek app, and so. Today, a month later I have two P2 sockets that won't stay connected for more than 24hrs. I don't know how others get such a good experience, but not my case. So have this in mind. The P1 is bulkier, but it's so reliable, that once you set it up, you can forget it. P2 could bring you headaches.

Have to reset it every few days...,1.0 ,"Update (11/21/2017): I lowered to one star because after a few firmware updates and I haven't had much luck with customer service. I really wish this worked as advertised because it's so cool when it works, but unplugging every three days is unacceptable. I really like the idea of what this plug can do. It connected to HomeKit easily and I attached it to a desk lamp in my office. The problem is, I have to crawl back and unplug and replug the unit every few days because it becomes unresponsive. I hope this is something with the firmware that can be updated by the manufacturer.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Fantastic WiFi Plug!!! You'll love this unit!!,5.0 ,"I ordered this Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi on July 5th and the order said it would take 4 weeks to deliver. I received the order in 9 days, so if you buy this, don't worry about the long delivery. It's pretty fast! When I received this plug, I read the directions on the very tiny booklet included. I'd like to see this booklet printed in a little bigger print as it was hard to read with such small fonts. But, it was pretty straight forward. Don't think that this is only for Apple products either. I'm using my Samsung Galaxy S5, Android and the unit works perfectly!! In the attached pictures, you will see that I've plugged a multi outlet into the Koogeek. This can control everything I plug into the multi outlet, and yes it works great. I has some troubles at first, trying to get my Android phone to detect the unit. Upon further trials, I re-read the directions and they clearly state that this unit will not operate on dual band or 5Ghz. You will see a screenshot of my phone and where to ""uncheck"" the smart switching between networks. Make sure you have unchecked this box. Once I did this, the unit was found and set up very quickly! Now I have our living room light attached to the multi outlet and I've tested it going on and off, the ""Light"" on the plug in and everything works fantastic!!! My wife and I can leave the house and if we want to turn the light on while away, I just open the App and touch the ON and there it is! We have security cameras in the house so I can verify that the light has indeed come on. The lighted ring on the Smartplug works like a night light for us. So in the evening before bed, I turn the light on with my phone and it illuminates the hallway very nicely. Not too bright, not to weak. And the best part is, if I forget to turn the light on, we can just grab the phone and do it! Overall I would HIGHLY recommend the Koogeek Smart Plugh, WiFi Outlet. I am NOT paid to do reviews so this is just my experience! The unit is well constructed, aesthetically pleasing and great to use for security lighting or just peace of mind. The price is very reasonable for such a great product.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Love the Night Light Addition from the P1,4.0 ,"This Koogeek Smart Plugis the 3rd smart home device I have had and it is the best so far. Another I have had is the KooGeek P1 and it is a smaller footprint than the P1 with added benefits. I setup the device using Apple HomeKit before I ever even opened the Koogeek app. When I opened the Koogeek app, it already knew that the device has been activated and setup, so I didn't need to do anything in the Koogeek app. POSITIVES: - Koogeek app is very easy to use - Homekit setup process was so simple, just typed in the number and it was done - When setup with Homekit using the Apple TV 4 or iPad, the device can be controlled when your phone isn't even on Wifi or in same location - Works to control device via Siri - Can setup timers and scenes for device to turn on at certain point throughout day - See how much energy device is using in Koogeek app - Easy accessible power button on top of device - LED light in above plug that displays if device is connected is lost internet connection - BEST PART is the added night light which can be control separately within the HomeKit or KooGeek app than the plug portion of the P2 - I set a scene where the nightlight comes on at 11 PM and turns off at 6 AM, so it is on in the hallway each night, even though the item plugged into the smart plug isn't turned on CONS: - I found was that when plugged in it covers the 3rd pin port on other plug in because of the size of the device - For some reason, every so often the device will loose connection with WiFi and display a red light so when you go into the HomeKit app it isn't able to be reached. To fix it, I unplug it then plug it back in and it reconnects to the internet.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Works Great!,5.0 ,"I love the amount of automation I can schedule with this outlet, and it responds very quickly to Alexa commands. I have a bunch of different remote and smart outlets that I use, being that I'm in a wheelchair they make life just a little bit easier. I have this one by Koogeek set to turn on my sound machines and fans in my room when it's bed time. There's also the option to have it turn on or off by timer, or by location, which is pretty sweet, if you want to say have it turn the lights on inside your home when you reach your driveway. Adding it to my devices in my Echo Dot was straightforward and easy. Alexa flicks it on or off nearly instantly once she acknowledges the command. I like the optional night light that can also be turned on using Alexa, or through the app. It's something I didn't even know I wanted until I started using it. I love telling Alexa to ""kill the lights"" when I get in bed. Size-wise, it's small and unobtrusive. I think it looks really nice. The app has a simple interface, but is comprehensive, and I like that the outlet supports both Android and iOS, since my phone uses Android, but I have an iPad that I use to control most of my devices. I haven't had any issues with dropouts or problems with it disconnecting, but I think the quality of your router/wifi signal will play a large part. My router is in the same room as the outlet, but even when testing it in an outlet farthest away from the router it didn't have a problem. Personally, I don't have any complaints. It's working great.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Awesome Smart Plug with Night Light Built in!!,5.0 ,"I have been in the market to get my house more connected and I came across this Smart Plug, had some great reviews and has a built in night light, which is an awesome benefit to have! First off, I thought it was going to be a little rough to get it going because the box stated Apple all over it and I am only Android but the app was in the Play store and was extremely easy to set up. Once Connected: The best part right off the bat was that it has 2 separate buttons in the app, one for the night light and the other for the outlet, which means you can have the outlet off but still have the night light on!! It even lets you adjust the brightness of the night light as well, very awesome feature! On a side note, you can turn the outlet on and off with the button on the device itself, which is nice to have as a backup if you have to be quiet and phone is not near you. Using with Amazon Alexa: This was the most important part of the install, I am trying to get all my devices connected through Alexa. VERY EASY to set up! Find the Koogeek skill in the Alexa app and sign in, that was it! I uploaded a video of it working with Alexa, one for the night light and toher for the outlet, charging my phone. You will be happy with this device!","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Excellent Smart Plug,4.0 ,"I have neither Apple Home nor Alexa but still I wanted to automate some devices and have the ability to turn things on or off while away from home. This device works pretty slick and is easy to configure. Within 10 minutes of receiving the item I had it up and running. It is easily connected using the Koogeek Home app available from the Android Play Store. Plug in the outlet, start the app, create a new account or sign in with your existing credentials, and enter the WiFi information for the network you'd like the device to connect to. It is worth noting that you must have a wireless internet connection for this to work. The switchable night light is a nice feature but probably not the most useful for my situation. The web site's description for this item says that the Koogeek Home App can be used to ""easily control, monitor and schedule any connected device from anywhere through easy setup"" but I couldn't find any way to schedule a lamp, for example, to turn on every day at 9pm and turn off at 11pm without switching it on or off manually through the App. I asked the question here on Amazon about how to do this, and also asked Koogeek themselves by contacting their customer service but I haven't received a response yet. Hopefully if it isn't available already, that feature is planned for a future update to the Koogeek Home App because it would be a very useful addition.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Fantastic HomeKit compatible plug!,5.0 ,"I'm very pleasantly surprised by this smart plug. Koogeek seems to have done it (mostly) right. For starters, I am experimenting with Alexa vs. Homekit, so I have both types of compatible devices in my home. It's rare to find something that works with both this seamlessly. I was first surprised by the packaging and instructions. These days, you expect broken English and difficult to follow directions. Not the case with Koogeek at all. The app is seamless, helpful, has good directions, and isn't buggy in my experience. The paper manual is very well written with great directions that worked for me first try. My only issue with this plug is the size. I understand that there's a lot going on inside with the Homekit chip, et al, but it really sucks to not be able to plug more than on into a standard outlet. I would be okay with a less sleek looking plug or having to put one of them in upside down to be able to use my other outlet. Overall, this is 100% worth the money compared to the rest of the market, such as the WeMo plugs. I can't wait to work these into other areas of the house!","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Best Smart Plug to date!,5.0 ,"The Koogeek smart plug was so easy to install. After downloading the app and registering I just scanned the code and plugged it in. It instantly worked. I then downloaded the skill w Alexa and same thing. I logged in and it discovered the plug. It was so easy. I love that the plug has a separate night light. It's not super bright which I appreciate so it doesn't disturb my sleep. It would be great in kids room also. You can turn the night light on or off w Alexa or Siri or just your phone independent of what's connected to the plug. The plug is small enough that it allows you access to the top outlet, something my other smart plug doesn't do. The app itself is amazing. It tracks your consumption month by month in an easy to read chart. You can also create scenes to control multiple devices at the same time w one simple command, pressing it or by creating a schedule. Finally the best part is that this plug connects to my Iwatch and allows me access right from my wrist. Love this smart plug.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
Koogeek surpasses quality and function expectations.,5.0 ,Wow! I am once again quite impressed with Koogeek. This wifi enabled smart plug connected seemlessly with the Koogeek Home app and with my Echo Dot via Alexa. I can control the plug with my voice through the Apple HomeKit and also Alexa. One nice feature of this plug is the ability to schedule the outlet to come on at a certain time each day or to turn on or off after a specified amount of time passes. Thisnoutlet also has a built in ring of light that can be used as a nightlight whether or not it is being used with a light or other device. Being able to use either Alexa or Siri to control the plug is an awesome feature. I highly recommend this plug for the user who wants to automate their home. It feels the most solid and provided features of the much more expensive units.,"Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R
So easy to use,5.0 ,I have a couple smart outlets now and they are great. It was easy to set up. We have used it for turning on some lights so they will be on when we get home. The app is easy to use and understand. I like being able to control things from anywhere. Doesn't matter if I want to be lazy and sit on the couch and turn off the lamp or if I want to be across town and turn on the coffee maker. One thing I really like is that I can still plug something into the other outlet even while this is plugged in.,"Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

They were, I restarted the app, my phone, even uninstalled and reinstalled and still at getting that error. My phone is all up to date with the specifications and I was on the right kind of network. Hopefully there's an update that fixes this bug in the app, but for now I can't really give this a fair review because I couldn't even get it to work.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

Serious connectivity and stability issues,2.0 ,"From my experience with this product, reliability and steady connectivity has been a real issue with this product. Even though the device is within good range of my WiFi network, other devices around with a steady connection, connection is steady for maybe a day or even less and then drops. Neither the koogeek app nor HomeKit is able to talk to the device and I have to unplug and replug it. I also own the previous bulkier version of this device and it has had a constant steady connection since day one, never had any issues so this is quite the disappointing product. Other then that I do like the energy consumption feature of this device.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

Works great,5.0 ,"This review is for the Smart Plug.This plug is a great replacement for far more versatile, especially if you own an Amazon Echo (or one of Amazon's similar devices such as Dot). I use it to control a floor lamp. After downloading the app to your phone, you must connect the outlet to your network. Select the option for which the outlet will be used, such as lamp. Once connected to your network. You can control the device, such as a lamp, with the app, turning it on and off, giving it a name. If you own an Echo, you'll need to open your Alexa app or go to the Alexa website (which I find easier to use), and add the outlet to your smart devices. Once you've added it, you'll need to scan for it. It's less complicated than it sounds. Once you are finished, using your Alexa device, you can turn the lamp (or other device) on and off with your voice. It works great and is very convenient.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

Making my home smart!,5.0 ,"This smart plug is so cool! I never had a smart home system before so I am very impressed with this product! I think I need to go buy some more until my entire home is controlled by my voice! The device came in a small little package with instructions. I was able to download the app, connect to the smart device, configure all the settings, and connect it to my amazon echo dot with no problems. The app itself looks very well made. It has a very user friendly interface. You can turn on and off the device in the app. I then tested it out with Alexa to turn on and off my device and it worked perfectly. You can name what you are controlling in the device’s app to anything you like. I am using the smart devices for my lamp and so far I have not encountered any signal drops. I highly recommend this product if you are looking to make a smart home system. It is not as expensive as some of the name brands out there and it works the same!

But it is nice that they are branching out to android devices which comprises a large amount of people. If you've never used a smart home device like this before then first things first is that your apple, android or smart device you are using to set up the plug must NOT be 5g connection. From there it's easy to set up. Download the Koogeek App and add the device and prompty enter the 8 digit code when ask to. The smart plug as various and useful applications. Whether you want to use it for lighting (I assume most buyers will) or simply turning on and off the fan. The possibilities are endless.

P2 is far INFERIOR to their P1: This will be the last Koogeek product I buy.,1.0 ,"Nowhere near as good as their P1 smart plug. Very inconsistent and unreliable. Has stopped working repeatedly, meaning you have to delete and re-add it to the iPhone ""home"" app and start over, which is annoying. I've had to delete and re-add at least 5 times. I already have two of the older P1 plugs and they work far far better, and are more consistent. As to the Alexa capability, Alexa has never been able to find this plug, much less enable any skills. Perhaps this has to do with these already being set up to work with Siri and HomeKit, meaning it can't work with both? There is no way to really know, as Koogeek's support app/support literature is useless. Any ""support"" is merely a pdf of their setup instructions, which is not very helpful. This will be the last Koogeek product I buy, and will try alternatives. Stick with the P1 plugs, they are vastly superior to this.","Koogeek Smart Plug, WiFi Outlet, Works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit, on 2.4Ghz Network, for iOS and Android Devices Remote Control, Night Light",B06XKTM46R

Great for multi-gadget charging.,5.0 ,"Excellent for that person with several gadgets that needs/desires charging in a single area. Device can handle quite a bit of current and works very well. Excellent for desk or dresser top. Probably too large for a night stand --- personal preference there. This charging station takes up the least desktop space for number of outlets that I've found. If you don't intend to charge a lot of devices at once, then maybe a smaller less expensive item would be a better fit. Check out the Iselector Family Size 40W 5 Port USB/2 Outlet Docking Station, or Cyber Power Dual Use Power Station with 2USB/1 Outlet (very compact).

Yeah I could return it, but I shop online to avoid hassles, not to be presented one and have to repack it, get return slips, trek to the post office and monitor my account to make sure they didn't double bill me As they don't have a pink one listed, I can only assume this is their idea of red.",SAFEMORE USB Power Strip 10-Outlet Charging Station and 4 Smart USB Ports with 6.5-Feet Power Cord (White+Black),B06XNP9KS1

USB ports stopped working after 2.5 months.,1.0 ,"First off, the color is pink, not red. I love that though! This is big. I wasn't expecting that, but it is large! The USB ports just stopped working! I have had it for 2.5 months. I'm totally bummed. because this thing is perfect. Even though this is mine, my husband hates it because it makes a very high pitched noise which drives him crazy. I can tune it out. The USB ports have a separate switch so they can be turned on/off. My husband always switched it to off. Based on the USB DEFECT, I could not recommend this device.",SAFEMORE USB Power Strip 10-Outlet Charging Station and 4 Smart USB Ports with 6.5-Feet Power Cord (White+Black),B06XNP9KS1
Buy this device!!,5.0 ,"I now have three of these. The first one I bought several months ago. I liked it so much I bought two more. I notice some complaints on the reviews about noise and unreliability. I have had no problems with these. The plug-ins go across, not down like they do in a multi-bar. That means you can actually use each plug-in for an adaptor. On the multi-bars, an adaptor sometimes covers several plug-ins! You can also turn off each half of the device. That means if you aren't using an adaptor you can leave it plugged in to the device without any power going through it. That's better for fire safety and power consumption. I don't use the USB chargers much, but you can turn that section on and off also. I especially like the colors. I work all day in a studio full of black pianos, computers, black guitar amps, black everything. How refreshing to see something cheerful. Last, but not least, the whole thing takes up much less space on your desk and the cords are much easier to arrange efficiently.",SAFEMORE USB Power Strip 10-Outlet Charging Station and 4 Smart USB Ports with 6.5-Feet Power Cord (White+Black),B06XNP9KS1
Useful desktop power station with both AC and USB power output,5.0 ,"This is a handy device that I think is useful for a desktop or similar location where there is a need for both AC power and USB power, bringing the plug locations up away from the wall outlet or floor and placing them easily within reach. It provides eight (8) AC outlets, and each group of four (4) is switchable using one of the black buttons on the top of the device. When depressed, the button will show a red LED illuminating it discretely and power is available from the outlets on the corresponding side of the device. Either side, or both, or neither, can be powered as needed. Output capability is 4000W, 10-16A, which is fairly high. The unit is actually rated for 110-250V although the plugs are all US style. The cord used to connect the device to AC power is heavy and grounded. The product packaging states that overload protection is provided, without any specifics on exactly how that overload is designed. There is no reset capability as far as I can see and no fuse incorporated. The information on Amazon states surge protection but the product packaging does not say anything about surge, and frankly I am skeptical if this device provides any meaningful surge protection capability. If surge protection is desired, and if the devices to be connected are ones that really should be protected from surge damage, then I recommend purchasing a surge protector that is properly designed and includes specifications that make it clear what it will do in case of surge. Sellers use these terms, such as 'surge protection', far too casually these days. A small single sheet 'product manual' is included with the device, which is almost useless and says virtually nothing of importance. Regarding USB capability, the unit I received stated a max 2.1A output on the side of the box, however I connected an iPhone to the top port and received 1.0A while simultaneously connecting my iPad to the bottom port and receiving 1.5A there. I also note that if higher currents are required for charging devices then it would be equally possible to simply plug their respective chargers into one of the AC outlets and obtain the 2+A required in that way. Powering up the USB ports requires that the small button below the USB outlets be pressed, and when they are powered then a blue LED illuminates. It's relatively bright for such a small light. This is a fairly large device for the desktop but considering the eight AC outlets I think it's appropriately sized. It's not very heavy but does include rubber pads on the bottom to make it sit in one place without slipping around too easily. Overall I like this for the ability it provides to put power very conveniently on the desktop, and I will probably use it in that way myself. I have the red and white unit, which is really more of a pink and white color and would not be my own personal choice, but it looks fine (and blue is also available). If there are any other observations I have after using this for a longer time, I will return to this review and update it. I received a sample of this power strip, at no cost from the seller and for the purpose of review, and I have no affiliation with either the seller, or Amazon.",SAFEMORE USB Power Strip 10-Outlet Charging Station and 4 Smart USB Ports with 6.5-Feet Power Cord (White+Black),B06XNP9KS1
Died after 6 Months of Regular Useage,2.0 ,"I brought this on July 28, 2016 and it arrived very quickly 2 days later. I loved the color which matches the pink and gold theme of my desk. Found it very convenient because it can sit on top of my desk. Last night it pretty much died. I had my normal items plugged in: laptop cord, small led desk lamp, 2 usb cords, and a mini white noise machine.

I tried using electrical tape over at least one of the LEDs that was brightest but it just glowed from within instead. Each of the buttons on top have a red LED light and the USB strip has a bright blue LED light. If you're going to put this in a bedroom to charge your devices, don't bother with it. If it's going anywhere else you should be fine. The LEDs don't seem necessary at all is the weird thing. They're there to essentially show that those outlets are on or off but I don't see why you would ever want just half of the outlets to work or to turn off the usb strip?

Great smart plugs...,5.0 ,"**UPDATE 6/7/2017** It looks like they finally fixed the below issue with the icons and the iOS widget finally started working again. It looks as though the issue was completely on their end as no app update happened. The icons just suddenly re-appeared this morning when I opened the app. Hopefully, this won't happen again. **UPDATE 6/5/2017** I am lowering this to TWO stars until they fix their app. When I first installed the app, on the homepage, I could see a list of my devices(6 of these) and to the right, I would see a grey/green power icon showing the status of each device, right in the list. However about 4-5 days ago, I opened the app and promptly watched all of these icons DISAPPEAR, one by one, in a couple seconds and they have yet to reappear. Since they have disappeared, the iOS widget no longer works either. It just shows a message ""No device available temporarily"". I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app, resets of my phone and even forgetting the devices and reconnecting them, but nothing makes them come back. The app on my wife's phone is doing the same thing, so I know it's not specific to just me. The worst part is, I have put in THREE(3) support message over the last 5 days but haven't gotten any response. This stays at 2 starts until they fix this. **Original review below** These work great and the same as the bigger names for HALF the price. I picked up a couple Echo DOTS and was looking for some smart sockets to handle my lights. The big names wanted $30+ for their sockets but in searching Amazon, I came across these. The reviews looked really good, so I took a shot and ordered a couple. Well, they work great. The only issue I initially had was my phone was connected to my 5ghz network and when I ran the Tuya setup for the first device, it acted normal and asked me for the password to my network, but would just eventually time out and not connect. I finally remembered that these are 2.4ghz only devices(as all pretty much all the smart sockets right now). I switched my phone over to the 2.4ghz network and reran the setup and it connected in about 10 seconds. I could then return my phone to the 5ghz network and the device would still be seen(since now that it's on my network, my router handles the interaction). Tuya should throw up a red flag when you try to connect using the 5ghz network, since the device doesn't work on that band. I now own 6 of these devices and they all work great, I use 3 upstairs and 3 downstairs and have them grouped together. Alexa sees them perfectly and I have them tied to Alexa for voice commands. The only issue there is, Alexa doesn't seem to see these devices in the ""Scenes"" section. So if I want to do a scene(aka, when you get home, have the lights turn on automatically(based on your phone's location), you have to set up the scene in the Tuya app. Pros... - EASY setup(just remember to put you phone on the 2.4ghz network for the setup, after that you can return to the 5hgz network if you want) - Great price for all that it can do. - Works well with Alexa(just can't do scenes in Alexa) - Tuya app allows direct access to the devices, even away from home. Cons... - Only a 2,4ghz device but it doesn't tell you that during setup, so the setup will still try to connect on the 5ghz network but will fail. They need to make the app's setup smarter to detect if you are on a 5ghz network and stop the setup until you get on the 2.4gz network. - Alexa doesn't seem to detect these devices in the ""Scenes"" section, so you have to set up any scenes in the Tuya app - No IFTTT integration All in all, these are well worth the price, especially since they function just like the higher prices ones, at half the price.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN
"Easy Setup, Works Great",5.0 ,"Works as advertised. Very simple setup, all done on your phone...download the app to your phone (iPhone in my case--use the UR scanner, much easier and faster) and go thru the registration process. Once done with that, plug the device into an outlet & turn it on, you'll be asked to enter your network's password to initiate the connection, open the app on your phone and that's it. I can control (turn on or off) the outlet remotely (like at work). I have a heater plugged into it, so I can turn the heater on or off whenever I need to. (it's for my cat, when she's not there I turn it off, when she's sleeping at the heater I turn it on--I also run IP cameras as well which is how I keep tabs on my home) Just keep in mind that the outlet cuts power to whatever you've got plugged into it. So, if you have a device that doesn't restore power when power is lost, then this won't work for you. Ex. a fan or in my case a heater, is always on or always off. Bec it has a static power switch. If power is cut, the device's switch is still on and will restore power. However, my PC isn't. Its power switch isn't static. You have to physically depress the power switch to turn it on or off. Thus, if power is cut you're screwed if you're not there to physically turn it back on; WIFI outlet or not. It won't restore power to your device. So keep in mind what kind of device you want to use it for.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN
Geek heaven!,5.0 ,"Recently purchased this because I just really wanted to try it. I only got the one because I wasn't really sure how well I'd like it, or how well it would pair to Alexa. Let me just say - this thing is AMAZING!!! Seriously amazing! I did technically buy 2, but I gave one to my nerd friend who also enjoys super cool geeky toys. Now, the con side to it though is I had to go through the Play store for the app because the QR code app download did not work as attended. Not a huge con, but a con nonetheless. Pros - soooo many pros. The app set up is easy. The pairing to Alexa is super easy. The absolute nerd joy of just being able to tell something to go on and off, incomparable to anything else. Set up literally took me less than 3 minutes once I got the right app download from the play store. It went that fast. There was no complicated steps. You could rename the plug easily. Alexa picked up the rename easily. Done. Product works without any hiccups. LOVE IT! Just imagine what you could put on this thing and just turn off/on from voice commands! Bonus points?!

Easy Set Up - Smarter than advertised. IFTT compatible.,5.0 ,"This is my first smart home device. I only have one, but it’s worked well so far on a small scale and given me a good feel of what the future of smart home living can live up to. You'll notice how slim this is relative to my regular plug in the wall. (see the attached photos) Setup was straightforward, easy, and quick. I liked this because I dedicated smart hub was not required. I’m using this connected to both my Android LG G5 smartphone and my IOS IPad connected to their dedicated (Smart Life App). So long as you have a wifi router, a hub is not necessary. So far the experience has been pretty convenient just while using their app. The app has some smart features such as auto wake and sleep based on location, time of day and even weather. From googling this specific product, I learned that this app can actually be set to run with IFTT (if this than that), which if you don’t know already, is a power automation program that can help streamline frequent tasks, and ultimately make processes smarter. You would be able to make this smart plug much smarter by creating what’s called an Applet, that could, for example, allow you to say a phrase to Google Now that would trigger the device to turn on or off. For example “Ok, Google, turn on the bedroom lights”. Or “OK, Google, get freaky”. Literally, almost any phrase you want could be set up to control your device. If for example you had several of these plugs and their bulbs, just being able to speak a voice command would be so handy. It would be huge potential, if it could work. Unfortunatley I was unable to test its abilities first hand as either the IFTT app or the Home Life app developers caused an issue that prevents you from setting it up. I’m thinking it’s probably an issue from IFTT app and that it will probably be fixed soon. Even with just using the dedicated Home Life app, the experience has been good and worked as expected. I’ve primarily used it to control my bedroom lamp. There’s almost no delay between when I press on/off on the app. It would be cool to add more of these devices to my home and see how much automation can be done. I hope the IFTT implementation is fixed soon as well. I hope this helps.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN

Works good but hogs bottom receptacle,4.0 ,"I just recently got an Echo Dot and so I wanted to buy a simple smart outlet to see if I would like it and get good use out of it. I ended up buying the Smart Plug S2 WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control by E-SmartPrime. Included with the outlet is the outlet user manual and also a manual to connect to Alexa with TUYA smart device. Both manuals are clear and easy to follow and setup of my new smart outlet was fast and easy. The outlet has a single grounded three prong socket to connect your device to. It has an on and off button and will light up red when it is on and it has a blue light that blinks when looking for the wifi set-up. It also has a usb port on the top of the outlet. The outlet itself uses a grounded three prong socket to protect your device in case of an electrical fault. What I don’t like about this smart outlet is the size and shape. The prongs on the backside are very close to the bottom of the unit therefore using in the bottom socket of a standard outlet, the top outlet is blocked for other uses. Plugging it into the top socket would be the ideal choice however this smart socket by E-SmartPrime has a curved bottom which invades the bottom outlets territory making it difficult to use a large plug in the bottom receptacle.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN
So cool & easy to use!,5.0 ,"This smart plug is so nifty! I got this because we will be travelling over the summer and I wanted to use it with a lamp or perhaps tv. And with me being able to set an automatic schedule or turning it on and off from my phone within the app anywhere is virtually awesome! This way we can act like we're home even when we're not. The smart plug was so easy to use and set up. Just plug it in, make sure the light is flashing then set up your wifi after you download the app. I had no trouble setting it up myself. I tried a count down and a timer set for 1 minute for the light to turn on. I'm thinking of getting more to control other things in my home!","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN
Works great,5.0 ,"This review is for the Smart Plug sold by SmartPrime. This plug is a great replacement for a timer and far more versatile, especially if you own an Amazon Echo (or one of Amazon's similar devices such as Dot). I use it to control a floor lamp. After downloading the app to your phone, you must connect the outlet to your network. Select the option for which the outlet will be used, such as lamp. Once connected to your network. you can control the device, such as a lamp, with the app, turning it on and off, giving it a name, or setting up a timer for each day of the week. If you own an Echo, you'll need to open your Alexa app or go to the Alexa website (which I find easier to use), and add the outlet to your smart devices. Once you've added it, you'll need to scan for it. It's less complicated than it sounds. Once you are finished, using your Alexa device, you can turn the lamp (or other device) on and off with your voice. It works great and is very convenient.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN

"Good WIFI connection, built in USB charging port and Alexa works well with it. I like it.",5.0 ,"PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THE TUYA APP AS PER INSTRUCTIONS THAT CAME WITH THE SOCKET. Instead install Jinvoo Smart from the android store. Trust me, this is not my first smart receptacle or light bulb and Tuya always has problems whether it be an outlet, a bulb or anything alexa connected. This is a solid performer. Most importantly it has a good range for WIFI to connect with. Some devices don’t have a strong antenna or transmitter so keep that in mind if your WIFI signal is not strong through your entire house. Setup is a breeze but what I enjoy most is the built-in USB charging port on the outlet. Perfect for a charging cable for your phone without eating up an additional outlet. The charge rate is 1A so it won’t be QC capable but perfect for slow charging overnight on your nightstand.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN
Convenient smart outlet at the touch of your hands,5.0 ,This outlet was needed in order to be able to control a switch remotely without having to get up.

Once connected the switch operates as an on/off to the outlet allowing control of a light or any other device. Exactly met my needs.

Making my home smart!,5.0 ,"This smart plug is so cool! I never had a smart home system before so I am very impressed with this product! I think I need to go buy some more until my entire home is controlled by my voice! The device came in a small little package with instructions. I was able to download the app, connect to the smart device, configure all the settings, and connect it to my amazon echo dot with no problems. The app itself looks very well made. It has a very user friendly interface. You can turn on and off the device in the app. You can also create scenes. I then tested it out with Alexa to turn on and off my device and it worked perfectly. You can name what you are controlling in the device’s app to anything you like. I am using the smart devices for my lamp and so far I have not encountered any signal drops. I highly recommend this product if you are looking to make a smart home system. It is not as expensive as some of the name brands out there and it works the same! I rather pay less money especially if I want to turn my whole home smart.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN

Everything was fine at first,1.0 ,"See update below: Original review: Woo hoo! Finally, an outlet that works with Alexa and DOES NOT cost $30 or more! I got this one for $14.99. Personally, I don't want the smart lightbulbs because you can't use a lightbulb to turn on your coffee maker or TV (at least not in 2017; how awesome the future will be when at last we will achieve the dream of turning on coffee makers with our lightbulbs, j/k). However, you can turn on a coffee maker, TV, radio, etc. with an outlet (meaning that you can supply the electricity to the device. Not all devices are able to turn on by simply having a connected power source, like most TVs for example, but if your coffee maker has manual on/off button you can leave the button on and use the outlet with the app to turn it off and on). Setup was super easy (just plug in the outlet, download the Tuya App, and follow the instructions on the screen). Pairing with Alexa was easy too. To do this, you need to have your Alexa App open and of course your Echo device (dot, etc.) has to be on as well. This smart outlet is excellent for me because it lets me turn my reading lamp off while still being in bed. If I'm tired enough to fall asleep and then start moving around to turn my reading lamp off that wakes me back up again. If talking out loud wakes you up, just use the app and press the button. Update: Two weeks after I wrote the review above, the outlet stopped working. To make matters worse it stopped working on the very day I was going on an out of town trip and needed to be able to use the outlet to time my lights accordingly. I contacted the seller and he/she told me to wait a few days and if it still wasn't working they would give me technical support. I contacted them twice and have not heard anything back. I guess they wanted me to wait a few more days until it was past the time limit for me to return the item for being defective. Smooth move. The problem is that the outlet knocks itself offline. So, I unplug it, plug it back in, and everything is fine for about 30 minutes. Then it's offline again. I've tried resetting it too and that doesn't help. I even tried resetting it and reinstalling it with the app. The didn't work either. My advice to you is to spend a few more dollars and get something that will work longer than 2 weeks. **ALSO - the description says that there are two outlets. I only received one.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN
My First SmartPlug works without issue,5.0 ,This was my first smartplug that I ordered. I have been looking at them for a while and decided to try it. I was skeptical at first but to my surprise was easily installed. I downloaded the Smart App as required first. It found the Plug and was able to hook up to my wireless. Granted it didn't have 5 GHz channel but I won't knock a star off for that. Once I got it hooked yup to the Smart App I was able to download the Skill for My Amazon DOT. It was able to connect up to the Plug without issues and the first time. I can now use my DOT to turn the Plug on and off which is really cool. I will probably buy more Smart Plugs in the future if they are as easy to setup as this one. I would recommend this and follow the documentation and you should have it hooked up in no time.,"Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN

The E-Smartprim smart Wifi Plug Outlet there is!!,5.0 ,"These plugs are really amazing! Here is an outline of a test that I did with these before I trusted them. I was nervous to rely on these if perhaps they didn't meet this test. I was delighted to see that they did pass my test easily. The setup: I plugged a lamp into one of these devices and I had the smart outlet plugged into a regular wall socket. I installed the app on my iphone and connected the smart plug to my wifi through the application on my phone. I turned off wifi on my phone and used my cell phones 4g internet for this next step so I can test setting up a timer from a different internet connection than the one that the smart outlet is connected too. This worked without a problem. I set an ""on"" time for a specific day and an ""off"" time for a couple minutes later on the same day. I waited for about 20 seconds and then I turned off my phone and turned off the home wifi so that the smart plug was no longer communicating with the internet or my phone. Amazingly the smart plug stored the commands and was able to turn on the lamp and turn it back off without communicating again with my phone. Needless to say, I was convinced this plug can be relied upon to continue to work even when the phone and the device are no longer communicating. I turned off the home wifi to ensure the smart outlet didn't need to continue communicating with a server and would still function on schedule if the home wifi stopped working. I'm still amazed at how this smart this outlet is.","Black Friday-Cyber Monday Clearance Sale Day 2017-Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug Outlet 2 Pack,Works with Alexa,WiFi Smart Socket Outlet Remote Control,No Hub Required",B06XQB1QDN
