shoot tip read befor buy and befor instal,4.0,the belkin switch is good and it ll get the job done but i did have some with the instal and use review to help me get it to work so i thought i would share so other might have an easier time first of all my instal wa a bit more than most i wa 5 switch in the same box i m not an electrician and i have an old hous with old wire one veri import thing to understand is that you need to have a neutral wire switch wont work without it neutral wire are white if you live in an old hous there is no tell what short cut have taken over the year sinc it went up or how thing have chang in term of wire standard clue that a wire is neutral is that all the neutral wire come from differ port in the box are join by a wire nut if you wire the whole thing as per the instruct and the switch is not work or act click sound and light flash few second etc you may have an with the neutral wire two thing i learn from thi instal 1 you can buy a veri cheap for less than 3 and use it to make sure none of the white wire that are bound are hot have current or not neutral you will need to have the breaker switch on for thi test if you touch one end of the to the expos part of a wire and the other to ground the metal box case hot wire will caus the to light up neutral wire will not in my case one of my white wire wa actual a hot wire and wa disrupt the neutral wire in the wire nut and caus my to not work 2 make sure you have a enough wire nut to handl the number of neutral wire you are tri to tie in my case just one more wire wa too much i tri use it anyway and the switch didn t work the neutral wire were not bound final i to purchas a huge wire nut that would fit the 6 neutral wire and guess what it work next onc your switch is work or instal at least it ll tri to download a go ahead and let it do it s thing but that thi may not proceed in the as straight forward manner my wa that the proceed then it gave me a say hooray complet on my phone about 15 later then it tri to again but thi time it never end i even left it overnight review had mention that hi took all night the follow morn it wa still not work but at least it wasn t click and flash my light i read on some post that if you have thi never end you can turn off the breaker and turn them back on and somehow it will fix it i wa near the end of my rope at thi point and think of throw it in the trash but the trick work turn the breaker off and on fix the i that if the breaker had to be turn off again or if the light went out it would somehow stop work again but i have sinc had to shut the breaker off to work on other non switch and it hasn t caus ani problem my light switch ha been work as without ani problem sinc the instal and i m happi with the product i have an old old router that i bought refurbish for 20 and i have about 30 ft and a brick wall between the router and the switch and it work without a hitch now i use it to turn my porch light on at sunset and off at and i turn it off earlier use my phone befor go to sleep in make sure you have a neutral wire make sure all the neutral wire are actual neutral and there aren t ani hot wire use an size wire nut for the neutral wire and if your take more than 24hr turn the breaker off for a and then on again i feel like mani of the neg review may stem from give up or not be abl to success troubleshoot small that come up almost all work some troubleshoot and even if you don t know what you re do haha note dure my instal process i never use the reset button on the devic i would give the devic 5 star if not for the never end good luck,"Wemo Mini Smart Plug, Wi-Fi Enabled, Works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant"

the mac address are differ for each plug it will allow for one switch to work and the other two to be under local wi fi network control when i chang the name on my router and gave them static address at the same time all plug work a help tip other home item control by like ip camera no need to do ani port forward and router trick to make them work they are plug n play after you find them on your network through the kasa app manual turn on provis is the part program time work just as will program the plug from the kasa app you have to program one on time and a second off time i understand that up to 50 time can be store per plug i have not tri it one review blast the or the lack thereof these plug he bring up sever point but overal ha to have some sophist hardwar and program skill to catch these plug pass your wi fi password info across the local network noth is absolut if want that info they will get it plain and the statist of your wi fi network be hack by these plug are veri at best i would far more about a smash and grab theft of your hardwar your network or an arm of your cell phone with the kasa app than a sniffer wait wait wait to your plug talk with your network more
